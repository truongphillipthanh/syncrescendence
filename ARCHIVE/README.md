# ARCHIVE

Distilled preservation of material that:
- Is NOT redundant with GENESIS or CANON
- Contains implementation specifications or forward visions
- Passed antifragility test (survives AI capability progression)
- Earned its position through rigorous compression

## Contents

| File | Source | Compression | Purpose |
|------|--------|-------------|---------|
| ARCHIVE-COGNITIVE-PALACE-SPECS.md | Coherence/2-CognitivePalace (903K) | 96% (→35K) | Implementation blueprints for 87-component system |
| ARCHIVE-ARTIFACT-SYSTEM.md | Coherence/1-Artifacts (426K) | 98% (→8K) | 21-artifact pattern language vision |

**Total**: ~43K preserved from 2.8M source (98.5% compression)

## Selection Principle

Archive exists because content:
1. **Is unique** — Not captured in GENESIS or CANON
2. **Is specification** — Implementation detail, not exploration
3. **Survives scrutiny** — "Will this matter with 10x better AI?" → Yes

### What's Here

**Cognitive Palace Specs**: The 87-component Meta-Governor architecture, Seven Pulses Dashboard, layer coordination, cross-layer matrices. CANON-20000 describes *what* the Cognitive Palace is; this describes *how* to build it.

**Artifact System**: The 21-artifact pattern language for community practice infrastructure. Forward vision for collaborative development phases.

### What's NOT Here

- **Metahumanism framework** (923K) — Absorbed into GENESIS-001-LINEAGE
- **Mental Models** (564K) — Exploratory frameworks, not specifications
- **Elaborative prose** (830K) — Compressed into tables and YAML
- **Process artifacts** — Research prompts, intermediate drafts

## Relationship to Other Tiers

```
GENESIS/     — Why (narrative substrate, philosophical lineage)
CANON/       — What (constitutional architecture, operational truth)
ARCHIVE/     — How (preserved implementation specs) ← THIS
OPERATIONAL/ — Active (living documents, current work)
QUEUE/       — Pending (time-bounded items)
EXEMPLA/     — Demonstrations (examples, case studies)
```

---

## Usage

These specifications are **reference material** for future implementation:

- **Building Cognitive Palace UI**: Reference ARCHIVE-COGNITIVE-PALACE-SPECS.md for Seven Pulses Dashboard, layer coordination, personalization progression
- **Community Infrastructure**: Reference ARCHIVE-ARTIFACT-SYSTEM.md for pattern language structure

---

## Antifragility Justification

Both preserved documents survive the "10x better AI" test:

**Cognitive Palace Specs** survive because they specify *human cognitive architecture*, not AI implementation. Better AI models don't obsolete the design of how humans want their life-operating-system to function.

**Artifact System** survives because it specifies *social infrastructure* for community practice. Pattern languages for human collaboration remain relevant regardless of AI capability.
