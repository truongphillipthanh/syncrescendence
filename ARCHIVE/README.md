## Relationship to Other Tiers

```
GENESIS/     — Why (narrative substrate, philosophical lineage)
CANON/       — What (constitutional architecture, operational truth)
ARCHIVE/     — How/When (preserved specs + process archaeology) ← THIS
OPERATIONAL/ — Active (living documents, current work)
QUEUE/       — Pending (time-bounded items)
EXEMPLA/     — Demonstrations (examples, case studies)
```

## Usage

These documents are **read-only reference**:

- **Implementation Specs**: Reference for building Cognitive Palace, community infrastructure
- **Process Archaeology**: Learn from Oracle progression patterns, avoid repeated mistakes

**Do not modify. Extract patterns and learnings, do not revive deprecated approaches.**
