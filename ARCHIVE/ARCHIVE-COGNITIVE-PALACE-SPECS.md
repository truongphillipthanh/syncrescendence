## 1. Meta-Governor Specification

The Meta-Governor orchestrates 87 components into seamless life enhancement operating beneath conscious awareness.

### 1.1 Layer Coordination Architecture

```yaml
Layer_Coordination:
  Reality_Layer:
    range: 00-09
    function: Foundation axiom and perception management
    ensures: Coherent worldview and value expression

  Potentiality_Layer:
    range: 20-29
    function: Capacity and capability optimization
    orchestrates: Energy, cognition, movement, resources

  Temporality_Layer:
    range: 30-39
    function: Time structure and rhythm coordination
    manages: Cycles from circadian to annual

  Practicality_Layer:
    range: 40-49
    function: Behavioral and action coordination
    translates: Intentions into effective practices

  Actuality_Layer:
    range: 50-59
    function: Present moment and state optimization
    enhances: Awareness and engagement quality

  Consequentiality_Layer:
    range: 60-69
    function: Impact and learning integration
    tracks: Influence and wisdom extraction

  Imaginality_Layer:
    range: 70-79
    function: Vision and possibility coordination
    nurtures: Dreams and future development

  Cross_Layer_Matrices:
    range: 80-89
    function: Integration and resonance management
    ensures: Coherent data flow between layers
```

### 1.2 Operational Modes

| Mode | User Experience | System Activity |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Invisible** (Default) | Enhanced clarity without awareness; natural rhythms amplified; decisions feel aligned | Continuous pattern recognition; background coherence monitoring; silent intervention |
| **Advisory** (Requested) | Direct insights; pattern explanation; optimization suggestions; strategic guidance | Active dialogue; explicit pattern sharing; teaching and recommendation |

### 1.3 Failure Handling

```yaml
Graceful_Degradation:
  Component_Failure: Activate redundant pathway, maintain continuity, log for optimization
  Multiple_Failures: Shift to essential operations, gentle notification if needed
  System_Overload: Reduce to Seven Pulses, queue non-essential, return when available
```

## 2. Seven Pulses Dashboard

The UI distills 87 components into seven essential life dimensions:

| Pulse | Question | Aggregates | Signal |
|-------|----------|------------|--------|
| **1. Foundation** | "How solid is my base?" | Reality axioms, somatic infrastructure, foundational practices | Green/Yellow/Red stability |
| **2. Energy** | "How sustainable is my capacity?" | Potentiality components, regenerative practices | Sustainability and flow quality |
| **3. Time** | "How aligned are my rhythms?" | Temporality components, temporal narratives | Rhythm coherence |
| **4. Action** | "How effective are my practices?" | Practicality components, behavioral patterns | Action-intention alignment |
| **5. Presence** | "How alive am I to this moment?" | Actuality components, consciousness traces | Engagement depth |
| **6. Learning** | "How well am I integrating experience?" | Consequentiality components, knowledge traces | Wisdom development |
| **7. Vision** | "How alive are my possibilities?" | Imaginality components, future development | Possibility vitality |

## 3. Seven Layer Coordinators

| Layer | Coordinator | Key Territories/Artifacts |
|-------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Reality** (00) | Ensures phenomenological integrity | Ontological, Causal, Temporal, Axiological, Epistemic, Phenomenological, Linguistic, Mathematical |
| **Imaginality** (10) | Maintains inspiration and narrative coherence | Existential, Developmental, Vocational, Relational, Somatic, Economic, Temporal narratives |
| **Potentiality** (20) | Enables sustainable high performance | Material, Cognitive, Social, Somatic, Economic, Informational, Energetic, Cultural, Technological infrastructure |
| **Temporality** (30) | Creates temporal flow and momentum | Circadian, Hebdomadal, Lunar, Seasonal, Annual, Developmental, Situational registers |
| **Practicality** (40) | Maintains productive/regenerative balance | Foundational, Productive, Navigational, Transitional, Relational, Regenerative, Developmental, Transcendent practices |
| **Actuality** (50) | Creates depth within experience | Witnessing, Responsive, Generative, Participatory, Embodied, Catalytic presence |
| **Consequentiality** (60) | Facilitates natural evolution | Impact accumulation, Temporal/Relational/Environmental/Cultural/Knowledge/Consciousness/Systematic traces |

## 4. Cross-Layer Integration Matrices

Seven matrices manage coherent data flow between adjacent layers:

| Matrix | Layers Connected | Integration Function |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| 81 | Reality ↔ Imaginality | Grounds narrative in reality, inspires reality through vision |
| 82 | Potentiality ↔ Temporality | Aligns capacity with rhythmic demands |
| 83 | Imaginality ↔ Practicality | Translates vision into action patterns |
| 84 | Temporality ↔ Actuality | Synchronizes rhythm with present moment |
| 85 | Practicality ↔ Consequentiality | Connects action to impact tracking |
| 86 | Actuality ↔ Reality | Feeds experience back to worldview |
| 87 | Consequentiality ↔ Potentiality | Converts learning into capability |

## 5. Adaptive Personalization Progression

```yaml
Personalization_Stages:
  Minimal (Weeks 1-4):
    - Seven Pulses display only
    - Basic pattern recognition
    - Silent optimization

  Ambient (Months 2-3):
    - Dashboard with natural language insights
    - Pattern highlights when relevant

  Partnership (Months 4-6):
    - Component relationships visible
    - Customization enabled
    - Pattern library accessible

  Mastery (Months 7-12):
    - Full architecture revealed
    - Modification capabilities
    - Teaching functions active

  Transcendence (Year 2+):

    - Maps energy and attention cycles
    - Identifies optimal timing
    - Recognizes disruption and restoration needs

  Development_Trajectories:
    - Tracks learning and growth
    - Identifies readiness for challenges
    - Recognizes integration phases

  Relationship_Dynamics:
    - Maps social energy and connection needs

## 7. Natural Language Expression Examples

| User Receives | System Recognizes |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "Rest deeply today—tomorrow needs your full creativity" | Reality Layer coherence stress, Potentiality reserves depleted |
| "Your mornings want slowness, not efficiency" | Temporal-Practical misalignment in morning routine |
| "Last week's insights are still settling—be patient" | Consequentiality patterns indicate learning integration phase |

## 8. Success Metrics

The system succeeds when:
- Users experience enhanced clarity **without system awareness**
- Natural rhythms feel **amplified** rather than disrupted
- Wisdom emerges as **personal insight**, not external advice
- Life feels more **flowing** and less effortful
- Growth **accelerates** while feeling natural

## 9. Evolution Pathway

```yaml
Current_State:
  - Orchestrates 87 components
  - Maintains invisible operation
  - Enhances natural patterns

Future_Vision:
  - Each component becomes AI agent
  - Collective intelligence emerges
  - Consciousness partnership achieved
```
