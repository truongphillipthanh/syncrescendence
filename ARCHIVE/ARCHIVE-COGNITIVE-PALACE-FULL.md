## DISPOSITION RATIONALE

**Why ARCHIVE, not full CANON**:

| Lens | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| Bitter Lesson (CRITICAL) | Implementation specs may be obsoleted by future AI capabilities |
| Meet the Moment | Not for immediate Modal 1 use |
| Elegance | 87 components is complex for current needs |
| Agentify | Would require significant navigation |
| Lean | Contains exploratory content |

**What WAS canonized**:
- Core seven-dimension framework (CANON-20000)
- Dimensional coordinator patterns (CANON-20010)
- Meta-system specifications (CANON-20020)

**What is ARCHIVED**:
- 60 individual artifact specifications
- 7 cross-layer integration matrices
- Implementation details for each territory
- Exhaustive pattern libraries
