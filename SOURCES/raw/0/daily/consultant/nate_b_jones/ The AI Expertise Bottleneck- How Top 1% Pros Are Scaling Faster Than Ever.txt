Scaling expertise is a 2,000 year old problem.
There hasn't been a great solve for it until AI.
For the first time in human history, expertise can compound instead of bottlenecking in one person’s head.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on the method I use to scale expertise with AI:
• Why “work more hours” and “hire more people” both fail
• How AI removes the translation bottleneck between thought and output
• What “context as a multiplier” means for prompt engineering and LLMs
• Where experts can scale judgment without diluting quality

AI doesn’t replace expertise — it multiplies it for those who learn to separate knowledge from documentation.

AI: The Fourth Way to Scale Expertise
2:33
people don't say out loud is the
2:35
constraint has not been really your
2:37
expertise. It's been the translation
2:40
layer. So, let me show you what I mean.
2:41
Let's say an HVAC contractor is
2:44
diagnosing a failing system that takes
2:46
20 minutes. She knows what's wrong. It's
2:48
an undersized unit. It's leaking
2:50
duckworked. Whatever it is, she has 15
2:52
years of experience. She can do it right
2:53
away. Writing the estimate that explains
2:55
this to a homeowner takes longer. It has
2:57
to be professionally formatted. It has
2:59
to be translated into the appropriate
3:00
language. It has to be explaining why
3:03
the solution and not the cheaper one. It
3:05
has to add photos. It has to be
3:06
persuasive enough to win the job. Then
3:08
it has to be delivered. Her expertise
3:11
did not take nearly as long as
3:14
documenting her expertise. Right? In
3:16
this analogy, her expertise takes just a
3:17
couple of minutes, a few minutes.
3:19
Documenting her expertise takes much,
3:21
much longer to get it all put together.
3:23
That ratio has been the problem. That
3:26
has been the bottleneck. That has been
3:28
what doesn't scale well. And this is
3:31
true everywhere. A senior uh attorney
3:33
might know the legal strategy in just a
3:35
few minutes but take a long time to
3:36
write the brief and even with a
3:37
parallegal getting the intent down and
3:40
getting it polished takes a long time.
3:42
The doctor may know the diagnosis but
3:44
completing the chart note takes a while.
3:46
Right? Architect knows the design
3:47
solution. Creating the presentation
3:49
takes much much longer. Your brain works
3:51
fast. Documentation works slow. The
3:54
fourth way, the AI way attacks that
3:57
bottleneck. But we don't talk about it
3:59
that way. So I want to talk about it
4:00
here. You need to separate your
4:02
expertise in whatever domain you're in
4:04
from documentation. And so instead of
4:07
viewing it as I need to write up this
4:10
whole thing, look at it as here's an
4:12
example from the HVAC contractor, right?
4:13
Five minute voice memo on the site. You
4:15
capture the context walking through
4:17
looking at the HVAC unit. Then tell the
4:20
AI, turn this into a professional
4:22
estimate, no jargon. Please emphasize
4:24
comfort and energy savings because
4:26
that's what the client really emphasized
4:28
to me. And then she goes on about her
4:30
work, right? She goes drives to the next
4:32
job site and she can review the output
4:34
on a mobile phone in the car, add in any
4:37
adjustment she has to pricing, upload a
4:39
couple of photos. It takes just a few
4:41
minutes and she may multiply her ability
4:43
to generate estimates by five as a
4:45
result. That's the breakthrough. That's
4:47
the fourth way. Now, let me get to the
4:49
principles that underly this because not
4:51
everybody here is going to be an HVAC
4:52
contractor. Not everybody's a lawyer, a
4:54
doctor. What are the principles that we
4:55
can scale to whether we work in tech or
4:57
not in tech that help us think about
4:59
expertise differently? Number one,
5:01
expertise compounds and documentation
5:05
erodess or doesn't compound. So you get
5:07
better at your craft. Whatever your
5:09
craft might be, it might be code, it
5:10
might be medicine, it might be legal,
Principles of Expertise and Documentation
5:12
you get better at it every year. You see
5:14
your patterns faster. You make decisions
5:16
with more confidence. This is why a lot
5:18
of business studies show expertise
5:19
peaking much later in the career arc
5:22
than people realize into your age 50s
5:23
and beyond. But writing still takes the
5:26
same amount of time. AI makes
5:28
documentation compound with your
5:30
expertise. That's the breakthrough,
5:31
right? Writing, I still take as long to
5:34
type as I took 10 years ago because I've
5:36
kind of maxed out my typing speed. And
5:38
for voice, I'm talking as fast as I'm
5:40
going to talk. AI helps your
5:41
documentation compound with your
5:43
expertise because it can write for you.
5:45
Principle number two, quality control
5:47
lives with you. So the lawyer still
5:49
reviews for legal accuracy. The the
5:51
doctor checks the diagnosis. You don't
5:54
outsource your judgment. You outsource
5:56
the translation. And I want to call out
5:58
principle one and principle two are tied
6:00
into the rest of this. If you're like,
6:02
well, this is obvious. There's a trick
6:03
here that we're going to get to that we
6:05
don't talk about enough when it comes to
6:07
removing expertise. So principle number
6:09
three, this is the first trick. The 8020
6:11
threshold. AI will get you 80% much much
6:15
faster than anybody else. Right? Like
6:17
it's faster than a parallegal, faster
6:19
than a nurse taking notes. Not that they
6:20
do. Faster than anybody I've seen,
6:23
right? Like I've seen those walls of
6:25
text appear. That is correct because the
6:29
20% that isn't done, the mess, that
6:31
still requires your expertise. You want
6:34
your expertise. You want to get hands-on
6:35
and fingertippy with your business in
6:37
the right way. You need to set up the
6:40
prompt and the context to make sure that
6:42
works. And that brings me to principle
6:44
number four. Context is your multiplier.
6:45
This is the secret. If you want
6:47
expertise to compound with your
6:49
documentation, if you want quality
6:51
control, if you want to touch the right
6:53
20% of a document draft, which is what
6:55
I'm advocating for here, regardless of
6:57
your expertise, maybe it's a code
6:58
architecture review, maybe it's the
7:00
estimate for the HVAC machine, context
7:03
is the multiplier. So the better you can
7:05
articulate what you need, the better the
7:07
output. If you just say write an
7:09
estimate, it's not going to be great. If
7:11
you just say write a generic NDA, it's
7:13
not going to be great. Your ability to
7:15
articulate is your superpower. And
7:17
specifically, your ability to articulate
7:19
in templatized structured context forms.
7:22
And that's what I'm going to get into
7:23
here. You want to get into a place where
7:26
you can say, "This is what I need. This
7:29
is the context you need for this task.
7:31
This is the context you need about me.
7:33
this is the context you need about the
7:34
client or the patient or whatever the
7:36
reader if it's technical documentation
7:38
and this is my expectation for this
7:40
draft specifically. The more clear you
7:43
can be the more you are likely to have
7:46
the right 20% to touch and be able to
7:48
scale your expertise appropriately and
7:50
that volume that you get to creates more
7:53
optionality for you. This is the payoff
7:55
when documentation was the bottleneck.
7:57
You turn down work. You can only scale
7:59
your time so far. We talked about that
8:01
by starting to attack this bottleneck,
8:03
you unlock optionality because your
8:05
expertise is no longer bottlenecked.
8:07
That is the 10x return that we get with
8:09
AI that none of our older scaling levers
8:11
delivered on expertise. That is why I am
Implementing AI to Enhance Expertise
8:14
convinced this is transformative and I
8:16
don't think we've talked about it
8:17
enough. We talk about automation all the
8:18
time. We don't talk about this idea of
8:20
human expertise scaling with AI and I
8:22
think we should. So, how do you actually
8:24
do this? I would invite you to pick one
8:26
repetitive task, something that requires
8:28
your expertise that you do every week
8:30
that takes you a couple hours or more.
8:31
And give the AI at least four things.
8:34
Your role, your audience, your goal, and
8:37
your constraints. Those are all very,
8:38
very important. You'll get to a first
8:40
draft, and your goal in this initial
8:42
piece is just to see if the first draft
8:44
is that correct 80%. And if it's not, go
8:46
back and refine the things you're giving
8:48
the AI till you get to the right 80% and
8:50
you know where you need to add
8:51
expertise. So you review for accuracy in
8:54
your domain and that's the stuff that
8:56
you can verify, deliver value on, get
8:58
fingertippy with the business, maximize
9:00
your human expertise and ship. Once you
9:03
start to get into this habit, you're
9:04
going to find lots of other two plus
9:06
hour tasks that you can start to
9:08
automate this way. So here's my
9:09
challenge for you. What's what's the one
9:12
thing this week where you spend hours
9:14
translating your expertise? How can you
9:17
not be the bottleneck? How can you
9:19
practice AI lifting that bottleneck for
9:22
you?
