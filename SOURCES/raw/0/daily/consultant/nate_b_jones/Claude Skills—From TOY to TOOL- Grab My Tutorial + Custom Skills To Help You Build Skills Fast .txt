Claude skills took the world by storm
0:02
last week. This video is all about
0:04
giving you a complete tutorial so that
0:07
you know how to build a skill yourself
0:09
by the end of this video. But we're not
0:12
done there. We are not only going to
0:14
teach you how to build a skill. I'm
0:15
going to walk you through the common
0:16
pitfalls that I see. And I'm also going
0:19
to make sure that you understand the
0:22
kinds of skills that you can use to help
0:24
build other skills. I call them meta
0:26
skills. They aren't very widely in
0:28
circulation yet. I've built a bunch of
0:30
them for this video and I want to walk
0:32
through several of them with you so you
0:34
one know they exist and can grab them
0:37
and two know how to make them because I
0:39
think that's the more valuable piece. So
0:41
with that, let's get to it. First, the
0:43
big picture. Skills are a way to extend
0:47
what Claude can already do by giving it
0:50
very specialized instructions and tools.
0:52
They save a lot of weight on the prompt,
0:54
which is something I pointed out in my
0:55
first video right after Claude launched.
0:57
So, think of them like plugins or
0:59
extensions. You have one format and you
1:02
have three ways to use it.
1:03
Fundamentally, Claude code can read
1:05
skills directly from folders on your
1:07
computer. The web or desktop version
1:10
requires you to upload files through
1:12
settings. Traditionally, that has been
1:14
zip files. And by traditionally I mean
1:16
for the last week now they also can
1:20
accept a skill file type which is brand
1:23
new that Claude has introduced. I'll get
1:25
to that later. Finally, the API lets you
1:27
create and version skills
1:28
programmatically. One critical
1:30
requirement, you must enable code
1:32
execution or file creation in your
1:35
settings on the app or skills will not
1:37
work at all. And I saw people get
1:38
tripped up by that. Speaking of trip
1:41
ups, I have now seen a bunch of people's
1:43
skills in the wild. I've seen people in
1:45
my DMs asking me about skills since I
1:48
did my initial video. I want to give you
1:50
the top 10 things that have tripped
1:52
people up since Claude Skills launched
1:54
and how to address it. Number one, every
1:57
platform wants skills packaged
2:00
differently. And that is super annoying,
2:02
but it remains true. So, Claude Code
2:04
expects folders in specific locations
2:06
like /skills and web and desktop apps
2:10
will only accept zip files or skill
2:13
files, which by the way guys, if you're
2:15
wondering what a skill file is, it looks
2:17
like it is just a fancy extension on the
2:20
end of a zip. And I know that because I
2:22
threw a skill file into chat gpt and
2:24
guess what? It still works. Chat GPT can
2:28
crack it open if you tell it's a zip
2:29
file and can look inside and tell you
2:31
what's in there. So, you know that hack
2:33
I gave you last week where I said you
2:36
can use these skills in chat GBT chats?
2:38
Yeah, you can still do that. That still
2:40
works. If you upload a zip file to the
2:42
web version, Claude code will not see it
2:46
unless you extract it to the right
2:47
folder. This is another thing that trip
2:49
people up. Basically, Claude lives
2:51
locally on your computer, but also in
2:53
the web. And if you upload a skill, it
2:55
doesn't magically transfer to both
2:57
places. So, you have to think about
2:59
where you want the skill to be
3:00
accessible and do you need to put it in
3:01
a local folder? Do you need to upload it
3:03
to the web or the desktop so you can
3:05
chat with it in the interface? That's up
3:07
to you. I'm going to demonstrate the
3:09
interface because it's easier for people
3:10
to understand, but I wanted to give you
3:12
a sense of the breadth of Claude so you
3:15
understand why people get tripped up.
3:17
Trip number two, people forget to enable
3:20
code execution. I said this at the top
3:21
of the video, you got to enable code
3:23
execution. If it isn't enabled, you
3:26
can't upload skills and you can't run
3:28
them. Number three, skills don't trigger
3:30
when you expect them to. This one's
3:31
trickier, but Claude decides which skill
3:34
to use regardless of the surface. If
3:36
you're on Claude Code, if you're on the
3:38
web, whatever, it decides to use a skill
3:40
based on your description. So, a vague
3:43
description means Claude might not pick
3:44
your skill or might pick the wrong
3:46
skill. That means the first lines of
3:49
your skill.mmarkdown need to be
3:51
extremely specific about what it does.
3:54
Your skill.mmarkdown, by the way, is
3:56
just a plain text file that Claude can
3:58
help you build or you can build directly
4:00
that then gets zipped up into a zip
4:02
file, which Claude will accept, or this
4:04
fancy newskll ending on the file type,
4:07
which is basically the same as a zip,
4:08
but Claude decided to make it fancy.
4:10
Essentially, if that first line of text
4:13
isn't super clear, you're going to miss
4:14
out. And you'll see in the tutorial in a
4:16
second what I mean by super specific,
4:18
cuz I have an example. Number four,
4:20
versioning chaos matters. If you are
4:22
someone who uses claude code and the
4:24
interface and the app, you need to think
4:27
about which is true and real and how you
4:30
version these things. So pick a source
4:32
of truth and then put that skill into
4:35
every place you can think of if you're
4:36
one of those users that use all the
4:38
surfaces. Otherwise, you're going to get
4:40
confused. This brings me to number five,
4:44
which is there is a limit on the number
4:46
of skills you can access, at least in
4:48
the web and app versions. Claude limits
4:51
you to 20 uploaded skills and it does
4:54
enforce it. I have already hit that
4:56
limit and I have to make hard choices.
4:58
So think about the skills that you are
5:01
going to choose to invest in and make
5:03
sure you pick the right ones. I expect
5:05
that to shift as Claude gets more
5:06
capable over time, but that's the limit
5:08
we're at today. Next, you need to be
5:11
ready for a team level of confusion
5:16
around skills if you don't impose a
5:20
degree of order on common skills because
5:22
claude right now is just going to let
5:24
everybody upload everything in their own
5:26
cloud instances. And if you're in a
5:28
team's instance, that means that
5:29
everyone is going to have their own
5:31
version. There is no push to everyone
5:33
button for skills yet. I expect we'll
5:36
get there, but it doesn't exist. So,
5:38
everyone has their own individual
5:39
skills. And if you're an administrator
5:40
in a team's instance, if you're trying
5:42
to manage an enterprise install for
5:44
claude, that's something you'll have to
5:45
think about. That, by the way, is also
5:47
true if you are one of those people
5:49
who's doing the hack I mentioned in my
5:51
first video where you're using these in
5:52
chat GPT. Everyone in chat GPT is going
5:55
to be using these sort of skill things
5:57
individually
5:59
as a hack. And there isn't going to be a
6:02
teamwide instance unless you decide to
6:04
create a repository of skills that
6:06
everybody has to draw from. So think
6:08
about that if you are responsible for a
6:10
team. The next one I'm going to cover in
6:12
more detail. Security is not automatic.
6:14
And Claude does warn you. Skills may run
6:17
code. Skills may run scripts. You are
6:20
responsible for what you run and you
6:22
need to treat third party skills with
6:24
care to make sure that they're not
6:26
malicious. Last but not least,
6:28
documentation is super scattered right
6:30
now. I could not even find the updated
6:33
documentation on the skill file
6:36
structure. I just had to discover it and
6:39
tell you about it. There is this is
6:41
evolving so fast that we don't have
6:43
consistent documentation. So with that
6:45
in mind, look at the documentation you
6:47
can get from Anthropic and then also
6:49
look at other excellent sources of
6:52
documentation that are assembled from
6:54
the web. I'm going to link to a few in
6:56
my write up on the blog, but you got to
6:58
trust the community on this one to help
7:01
you assemble documentation. I don't
7:03
think Anthropic realized how big this
7:05
would be when they let it out. Okay, so
7:07
those are some of the pitfalls. We've
7:08
talked about the team side. We talked
7:10
about version chaos. We talked about
7:11
skills not triggering when you expect,
7:14
forgetting to enable code execution.
7:16
These are all things I have seen in
7:18
practice and I just wanted to get them
7:19
out of the way at the top because I
7:21
don't want you to get tripped up on the
7:24
value of skills and I want you to be
7:26
able to do something useful with them.
7:27
So with that in mind, let's jump into
7:30
how you actually build a skill. Okay,
7:33
here we are at the top of a tutorial on
7:35
building a skill. This is a PowerPoint
7:37
chunking skill. Remember how I promised
7:39
to solve some of these meta problems in
7:41
this video? Here's how I'm doing that. I
7:44
found in practice one of the biggest
7:46
issues that people had using skills is
7:49
it was tough to create powerpoints using
7:52
skills that did not run into Claude's
7:54
context window and generate a really
7:57
frustrating experience where you put all
7:58
the data and you put all the narrative
7:59
in and you get your fancy prompt and
8:01
then you put in your Claude skill and it
8:03
runs out of space. So I wanted to say is
8:05
there a skill I could build that Claude
8:07
could use to proactively help avoid that
8:11
situation and that's what this is all
8:13
about. So I my initial prompt is very
8:14
simple, right? There's not magic words
8:16
here. Help me build a PowerPoint chunker
8:18
skill. The idea is it is invoked when a
8:19
PowerPoint is asked for and it checks
8:21
how big the ask is. This is actually
8:23
important. I was very careful with that
8:25
wording invoked when a PowerPoint is
8:27
asked for because I want the skill to
8:29
invoke
8:31
so that any PowerPoint that's asked for
8:33
gets at least a look. And so then I say,
8:36
listen, I got to be honest with you. I
8:37
have some other skills in my in my
8:39
budget here. Are there other skills that
8:41
overlap with this? And so the first
8:43
thing Claus does is Claude goes and
8:45
looks and says, "Well, we have a token
8:46
budget adviser, which is another custom
8:48
scale I built that I'm going to stick on
8:49
the Substack. You have a pitch deck
8:51
builder and you have a general
8:52
PowerPoint builder, but Claude agrees
8:55
there doesn't appear to be a general
8:56
purpose chunker that triggers on any
8:58
PowerPoint request." So, it understood
9:00
my original prompt and it recommends
9:02
chunking for large presentations. So, it
9:04
does see an angle here that the three
9:05
skills up here do not cover, right?
9:08
There's the token budget, the pitch deck
9:09
builder, and the PowerPoint. And so then
9:11
it says,"I understand the challenge.
9:13
Would you like me to try and build for
9:14
this?" And I say, "Yep." And it just
9:16
starts building, right? It reads the
9:17
general PowerPoint skill to see if it
9:18
has chunking logic. It takes a few
9:20
seconds to look at gaps. And you can
9:22
actually pop this open and it will
9:24
actually give you like a lot of
9:25
specifics around how it's thinking about
9:28
each of these skills existing chunking
9:31
logic, right? Which is super helpful.
9:32
And you can dive in. I love the way
9:34
Claude shows this. When you look at the
9:36
three skills together, Claude says you
9:38
get this state, right? like what each
9:40
one does. The token and budget advisor
9:42
triggers on heavy input tasks, which is
9:45
what I built it to do. It can mention
9:47
presentations, but it's really designed
9:49
for something more, which is exactly
9:50
what I built it to do. Um, and then it
9:52
has the pitch deck builder, another one
9:54
I built, and it triggers during the
9:56
workflow once you're already in it. Um,
9:58
and so that's not quite right from a
10:00
chunking perspective. So Claude is
10:01
taking a deep dive. And one of the
10:03
things I love is that you can have
10:05
Claude do so much of the lifting. I
10:07
don't think people realize this. People
10:08
think they have to sit down and like
10:10
manually write a markdown file, and you
10:13
can, but you don't have to, right? You
10:16
don't have to. So, it agrees there's a
10:19
gap. It has a recommendation. It offers
10:21
to draft it, and it offers a sort of
10:25
distinctive approach. And I say, you
10:26
know what, to be honest, I think this
10:28
looks good. I don't really have any
10:30
concerns here. And so, it then goes and
10:32
executes 11 different steps to build it.
10:34
Let's just take a look at some of those
10:36
11 steps. It's going to architect the
10:38
skill. It reads the skill creator tool.
10:40
It creates the PowerPoint chunker skill.
10:42
It looks for packaging scripts. All of
10:43
this stuff it's doing in the background.
10:45
And eventually it comes out with three
10:47
documents. There's the skill itself with
10:49
that infamous.kill extension. Don't
10:51
worry, that's just azip in a disguise
10:54
for Halloween, I guess. Um, it comes out
10:57
with documentation because if anyone
10:59
knows Claude, Claude loves
11:00
documentation. Um, and it actually comes
11:02
out with a bonus document about how it
11:04
fits to existing skills. Uh, it then
11:07
tells you what it does. It re-emphasizes
11:10
my original request that it triggers on
11:12
any PowerPoint request. And then it
11:14
gives me the four strategies it's going
11:16
to use for chunking, which I love that I
11:17
get multiple strategies that will choose
11:19
between. So, sequential, structure,
11:20
first, etc. It explains why it's not
11:22
duplicative. And here are the files. And
11:24
I can look at them. I can say, "Oh,
11:25
well, let me check out the readme,
11:26
right?" Like, how does this actually
11:27
work? Super clear readme. I can read it.
11:30
I can understand. I can stick this
11:31
readme somewhere so I can follow it up
11:33
later. Can give me some examples. I love
11:35
this. It's great. And then you might
11:37
think, oh, I can then look at the zip.
11:39
Well, I got to tell you, the zip is not
11:40
going to render really pretty. It looks
11:42
like Dingbat's font in here. Don't
11:44
worry, it's still a functional skill.
11:45
That is just the way the zip is rendered
11:47
in. That's an example of how easy it is
11:49
to create a skill because all I have to
11:50
do is I just download that and then I
11:53
upload that into my capabilities section
11:55
and it will be right there. I'll show
11:57
you. So, here I am in my capabilities
11:59
section on Claude. I got there through
12:00
the settings section of Claude and I
12:02
went down and just clicked capabilities.
12:03
here. You might not see where it is
12:05
right away, but really all you have to
12:06
do is scroll down, right? You just
12:08
scroll down to skills, which is in
12:10
preview mode. You can upload a skill
12:12
here if you want. And you can also
12:15
enable or disable skills with this
12:17
toggle here. That works really easily.
12:19
If you click the dots, you can delete.
12:20
It's pretty self-explanatory. And
12:22
there's our new skill, PowerPoint
12:23
chunker. I just created it. Uh you can
12:25
see what it does very briefly. You can
12:27
expand the description so you see the
12:29
full thing. And you can It's just there.
12:31
It's active. and Claude will call it
12:33
when the time is right. And that's it.
12:35
Like, it's pretty simple. Now, you might
12:38
wonder what other skills you can build
12:39
that would help you with building
12:42
skills. What are meta skills that are
12:43
useful? Well, I have a collection here
12:45
that I've put together that I'm going to
12:46
share. Uh, I think the PowerPoint
12:48
chunker is super useful. I think the
12:50
skill security analyzer is a useful one.
12:53
So this one I built because I feel like
12:55
one of the gaps which I highlighted
12:56
earlier in this video is that Claude
12:59
does run code with this and we need some
13:01
kind of security analysis. So why not
13:03
use a skill to do it? I have a skill
13:05
debugging assistant. So when people have
13:07
trigger failures or parameter problems
13:09
or prompt conflicts, how can we start to
13:11
address that? Um I have a documentation
13:14
generator for skills in case people
13:15
forget their documentation. I have a
13:17
testing framework that provides test
13:19
cases for skills so that you can
13:21
actually test them. I have a dependency
13:23
mapper. By the way, if this starts to
13:25
look a little bit like software, this
13:27
goes back to one of the things I've been
13:28
calling out with prompts as a whole,
13:30
which I consider skills a subset of
13:32
prompts. You're feeding the machine
13:34
context to work for you. You got to
13:36
treat it like code. You're giving the
13:38
machine inputs. So, you treat prompts
13:40
like code, you treat skills like code.
13:42
The nice thing about skills is it has
13:44
never been easier to do that for a
13:45
non-technical person because here it is.
13:47
It will not change on you, right? like
13:49
you write the skill, you upload it, you
13:51
get it, and it's just there. You don't
13:53
have to remember it. And that's why I
13:55
keep emphasizing this is a substantially
13:57
easier way to do work and to do complex
14:00
work than we did before because it makes
14:03
a lot of the steady context you need
14:06
something you don't have to worry about.
14:07
It just sits here in skills. What I'm
14:09
aiming to do with these meta skills is
14:11
to take the steady context of we have to
14:13
check for security, we have to debug it,
14:15
we have to have a testing framework, we
14:16
have to have dependency mapper. Like I'm
14:19
assuming because of the response that
14:21
I've seen that people are starting to
14:23
build dozens and dozens of skills and
14:25
they're going to need tools like this to
14:27
help them track them and handle them. I
14:29
even have like a performance profiler,
14:32
an diagnostic tool for analyzing and
14:34
optimizing skill prompts, a skill gap
14:37
analyzer if you're wondering what you
14:38
can use, and of course, everybody's
14:40
favorite, the token budget adviser. It
14:42
tells you if you are going to run out of
14:44
tokens. So, my goal here is pretty
14:46
simple. This is becoming a big part of
14:49
the ecosystem. There are hacks that take
14:51
this right away into chat GPT. Like I
14:53
said, you can just upload the skill
14:55
file. And so, this is not going to be
14:56
limited to Claude for very long. it
14:58
already isn't if you want to be
15:00
adventurous. How do we start to go from
15:03
what a cool toy to we can do real work
15:06
with this? And I think so much of that
15:08
comes down to having useful
15:10
infrastructure like this that enables us
15:12
to take skills seriously and actually
15:14
build with them. All right, so we've
15:16
done a bit of a tutorial. I'm going to
15:17
give you one more peek at a really cool
15:19
skill before the end of this video. But
15:20
next, I want to just get into some best
15:22
practices that we're starting to see
15:23
emerge after the first week or so. And
15:26
we've had a lot of people sort of beat
15:28
on cloud skills and see what works. I
15:30
think that the first thing I want to
15:32
call out is in line with that idea of
15:34
treating skills like code, but I want to
15:35
make it accessible, right? You can
15:37
decide how seriously you want to take
15:39
skills. If you just want to yolo your
15:42
way through and throw a skill in, it
15:43
will work. If you feel like you need
15:46
skills to work for serious work all the
15:48
time, I would encourage you to use
15:50
version numbers. I would encourage you
15:52
to keep a change log. I would encourage
15:54
you to store your skills in some
15:56
dedicated place with a structure so that
15:58
you can co go back to them and find them
16:00
again. I would also encourage you to
16:02
design for discoverability in your skill
16:04
markdown file. Make sure that the first
16:07
paragraph is super clear. Use this skill
16:09
when you need to define specific tasks.
16:12
Right? It takes specific inputs. It
16:13
produces specific outputs. Don't use it
16:16
for things you don't want it to trigger
16:17
for. that that is one of the best hacks
16:20
you can have because it takes away the
16:23
missed trigger issue that people are
16:25
having with Claude skills where the
16:27
markdown starts with principles or
16:29
something vague and Claude progressively
16:32
reads the skill and just doesn't get to
16:34
the trigger in time. The other thing
16:36
that I would call out that is popping
16:37
from a best practice perspective is the
16:39
more you can have one workflow for all
16:42
the places where you use skills, the
16:43
better. So for cloud code, for the web
16:46
and the desktop, for the API, have the
16:49
same skill in a folder somewhere and
16:51
just like copy it into the web and
16:53
desktop, copy it to the right folder for
16:54
code. Just make sure it's not going to
16:57
be an issue where you have like
16:59
similarly named skills in different
17:02
versions on different surfaces. If
17:04
that's going to be you, like a little
17:05
organization is going to go a long way.
17:07
Testing before you ship matters a lot.
17:10
That's why I created a prompt uh skill
17:12
to help with that. Right? there's
17:13
literally a skill I'm shipping to help
17:14
you with testing because I think that's
17:16
something that's really annoying to do
17:18
but it needs to be done and I thought
17:20
why not write a skill for it. And then
17:21
for the security side, I also wrote a
17:23
skill to sort of assess the skills you
17:26
may create for security. And it goes
17:27
after standard vulnerabilities, right?
17:29
Like are there issues here with uh
17:31
dependencies we don't trust? Are there
17:33
issues here with uh code running in ways
17:36
that would perhaps not be appropriate
17:38
for a clawed web app to run, etc., etc.
17:42
There's a lot that goes into the
17:43
security side. I would encourage you
17:44
also, and this is just a small tip, but
17:46
if you're in a team environment, name
17:48
your skills after jobs, not teams. I
17:51
know that sounds weird, but the more you
17:53
can be clear about what the skill does,
17:56
the more you're likely to keep track of
17:57
it and use it for that purpose as
18:00
opposed to naming it like the product
18:02
management team skill for whatever,
18:04
right? Like just drop the team names,
18:07
drop your name out of it if you can, and
18:09
just name the thing for what it does.
18:11
And I think that's going to be useful
18:12
for you. Okay, before I go farther, let
18:15
me just show you a really cool skill
18:18
that falls in the meta-kill category,
18:20
but I don't think anyone's doing this.
18:22
This is the Claude skill for continuous
18:25
learning. Okay, here's the idea. I want
18:27
to take this idea that I've been sort of
18:30
finding across the web around continual
18:32
learning as a challenge. What would it
18:33
look like? And I want to turn it into a
18:35
skill because no one's done that and I
18:37
think it's super interesting. And so I
18:39
take that as a challenge and I say
18:40
within the constraints that you've got
18:42
tell me how you would solve this problem
18:44
and I want to make it clear right think
18:46
about your current constraints don't be
18:47
aspiring. Okay let me think about what's
18:49
actually possible says Claude. And so
18:50
Claude basically identifies that the key
18:53
thing the bottleneck is manually adding
18:55
any new update. But Claude could
18:58
identify opportunities to create new
19:01
skills autonomously within natural
19:04
conversation which would be a huge plus.
19:06
Claude can recognize learning moments.
19:08
It can document the learning in a
19:09
structured format and recommend a skill.
19:11
And it's sort of gives me a sample of
19:13
how this would work. Um, and then it
19:15
starts to sort of get into how Claude
19:18
and I would have to partner to do this
19:19
because if you're going to do continual
19:21
learning with an AI, you have to have a
19:23
contract or agreement between you and
19:25
the AI as to what you're going to learn.
19:27
And so I say, "Okay, I can live with
19:29
uploading this. What if we proceed to
19:31
write this as a a skill? What would that
19:34
look like and so it just starts to dig
19:35
in, right? Um and it says, "Let's look
19:38
at these sort of issues. Would we want
19:40
to tackle novel problem solving,
19:41
repeated patterns, domain specific?" And
19:43
you notice that Claude is getting
19:45
excited about this. This is going way
19:46
beyond any seed of text that I found.
19:49
And it's getting into
19:52
how you would actually operationalize
19:54
this. And so then I kind of read through
19:56
and I give my opinion and I say, "This
19:58
is the goal that I have. I want you to
20:00
start at being able to identify 80% of
20:02
tasks that hit the context window before
20:04
10% of the response tokens are used.
20:06
Clause like thank you for the clear
20:07
constraint. You're basically asking when
20:09
you have complex challenging pieces of
20:12
work, how do ident how do we identify
20:14
that in a way that's useful and generate
20:16
a skill opportunity something we can
20:18
learn and drive? And then Claude says,
20:20
"Okay, this is great." Uh, and starts to
20:23
build. And long story short, I can build
20:25
a continual learning capture skill and
20:27
stick it into Claude, which I think is
20:29
super cool. So there you go. We've
20:30
gotten through two different skill
20:32
tutorials here. You've seen how it
20:34
works. I've given you some of the
20:36
pitfalls that have caused people to trip
20:39
up on Claude skills and I've given you
20:40
some best practices. If we zoom out the
20:43
camera lens just a minute from all of
20:44
this tactical stuff. The reason why I
20:47
think this matters is because Claude's
20:49
skills are one of the handiest ways to
20:53
extend our prompting power that I have
20:56
ever seen. It is so easy now to do
20:59
harder pieces of work because you can
21:01
write one skill for all of the stuff
21:04
that you don't want to just repeat
21:06
yourself on over and over and over
21:07
again. And that's why people have gotten
21:09
excited about this. That's why it is
21:11
worth it to dig in and learn this. And I
21:14
don't want you to lose the value there
21:17
just because you have to wait into some
21:18
of the detail here. This is absolutely
21:21
worth it. So, I hope you enjoy the Cloud
21:23
Skills tutorial. If you want to go and
21:25
grab all those skills I demoed, I have
21:26
them over on the Substack. And honestly,
21:29
have fun. Like, this is an amazing
21:31
moment in AI because we all get to build
21:33
these skills and talk about them and
21:34
learn about them. And uh best of luck in
21:36
the wild new world of cloud skills.
