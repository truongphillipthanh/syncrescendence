Big Think is a multimedia web portal founded in 2007 by Victoria Montgomery Brown and Peter Hopkins, with a mission to provide expert-driven, educational content. Owned by Freethink Media, the company has evolved from a fledgling media platform to a leading knowledge hub featuring thousands of video interviews, articles, and educational programs from prominent thinkers and doers.

Mission
Big Think's primary mission is to make its audience "smarter, faster" by introducing them to "the brightest minds and boldest ideas of our time". The platform aims to challenge common assumptions and encourage new ways of thinking about work, life, and the world.
