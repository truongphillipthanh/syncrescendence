# An Informational Theory of Life

## Sara Imari Walker | Long Now Foundation Keynote

I'm happy to see everyone here tonight. This is all a work in progress, and I want you to feel like you're part of the journey, because this research program is fundamentally about what we are as living things. What I hope we can do with this work is develop new languages to understand ourselves. When I'm thinking fundamentally about the nature of life, I think we don't understand it yet. It's a bit like how humans talked about gravity before we had an understanding of the theory of gravity. We couldn't understand planetary motion in the night sky as being the same as what's holding us here on Earth. I think we don't have the language to understand the fundamental nature of life in a deep, rigorous, physical sense.

I want to start with a question that sounds deceptively simple: What is life? This question has been with us for a very long time. Every culture, every mythology, every religion has tried to grapple with it. But what's interesting is that despite all of our scientific advances, we still don't have a satisfactory scientific answer to this question.

Let me give you some examples of how people have tried to answer it throughout history. Aristotle thought life was about having a soul, an animating principle. In the scientific revolution, we moved away from that toward mechanistic explanations. People started thinking about life as a machine—Descartes famously argued that animals were automata. By the 19th century, with the discovery of cells, we thought life was cellular. In the 20th century, with the discovery of DNA, we thought life was genetic information. Now, in the 21st century, many people think life is about metabolism, or self-organization, or evolution.

But here's the problem: none of these definitions really capture what life is in a fundamental, physical sense. They're all describing features of life, but they're not explaining what life *is*. It's like trying to define water by saying it's wet, or flows, or reflects light. Those are properties of water, but they don't tell you what water fundamentally is—that it's H₂O, a specific molecular structure with specific properties that emerge from quantum mechanics.

What we need is a theory that can explain life in the same rigorous, mathematical, physical way that we explain other phenomena in nature. We need to be able to answer questions like: When did life start? Not just on Earth, but as a general phenomenon in the universe. How would we recognize life if we found it elsewhere? What is the relationship between life and non-life? Is there a sharp boundary, or is it a continuum?

These aren't just philosophical questions. They have practical implications. We're looking for life on Mars, on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, on exoplanets around other stars. We need to know what we're looking for. We're also building increasingly sophisticated artificial systems. At what point do those systems become alive? Or do they already count as alive in some sense?

## The Problem of Combinatorial Explosion

To understand why answering the question "What is life?" is so difficult, we need to understand something about the nature of possibility itself. This gets at one of the deepest problems in physics and chemistry: the problem of combinatorial explosion.

Let me illustrate this with a simple example. Take LEGO bricks. If you have six LEGO bricks of the same color, how many different ways can you combine them? You might think, "Well, that's not too many." But the actual number is 915,103,765. That's nearly a billion different configurations for just six identical bricks.

Now think about molecules. A relatively small molecule might have 30 atoms. But the number of possible ways to arrange 30 atoms into different molecular structures is vastly larger than the number of atoms in the observable universe. In fact, if you look at the space of all possible molecules up to about the size of a small protein, it's estimated that there are about 10⁶⁰ different possible molecules. That's a 1 followed by 60 zeros.

To put that in perspective, the number of atoms in the observable universe is about 10⁸⁰. So the space of possible molecules is almost as large as the space of all atoms in the universe. And we're just talking about relatively small molecules here.

This creates a profound problem. The universe is about 13.8 billion years old. That sounds like a long time, but it's actually not long enough to explore even a tiny fraction of the space of possible molecules. If you tried to synthesize every possible molecule one at a time, it would take far longer than the age of the universe to explore even a small corner of this space.

So here's the puzzle: the space of what *could exist* is vastly larger than what the universe has time and resources to actually create. The universe cannot exhaust all possibilities. Most things that *could* exist never will exist. The question then becomes: what determines what actually exists, versus what merely could exist?

This is where life comes in. Life, I argue, is the mechanism by which the universe explores this vast space of possibilities. But it doesn't do it randomly. It does it through a process of selection and historical contingency.

## Assembly Theory: Objects as History

This brings me to the core idea I want to share with you tonight: assembly theory. Assembly theory is an attempt to build a rigorous, quantitative, physical theory of life and its origins. The central insight is that objects are not just defined by their current physical properties—their mass, their chemical composition, their shape. Objects are also defined by their history: how they came to exist.

Let me explain what I mean. Think about a molecule of adenosine triphosphate—ATP. ATP is the primary energy carrier in all living cells. It's a relatively complex molecule with three phosphate groups, a sugar, and a nucleotide base. Now, you could describe ATP in terms of its chemical formula, its bond structure, its three-dimensional shape. But there's another way to describe it: by the minimum number of steps required to build it.

This is what we call the "assembly index." The assembly index of an object is the minimum number of steps needed to construct it from its elementary building blocks. For ATP, you need to perform a specific sequence of chemical reactions, each one adding a piece or modifying the structure in some way. The more steps required, the higher the assembly index.

Now here's the key insight: if an object has a very high assembly index—meaning it requires many steps to construct—and if you find many copies of that same object, then you can infer that something in the universe had to repeatedly perform that sequence of steps. It's not something that could arise by chance.

Through our empirical work, we've found that there's a threshold around an assembly index of 15. Objects with an assembly index above 15 cannot be produced repeatedly by any known abiotic process. Only life—as far as we know—can produce objects of that complexity repeatedly.

This gives us a way to quantitatively define life: life is what produces high-assembly objects. More precisely, life is a process that explores the space of possible objects and selects certain pathways through that space, building increasingly complex objects that carry information about their own construction.

## Selection Before Biology

One of the most important insights from assembly theory is that selection—evolutionary selection—doesn't begin with biology. It begins much earlier, at the level of chemistry.

When we think about evolution, we usually think about biological evolution: natural selection acting on genes, organisms competing for resources, populations changing over time. But assembly theory reveals that selection is actually a much more general process that begins long before the first cell, before the first replicator, before anything we would recognize as alive.

At the chemical level, certain molecular structures are easier to form than others. Certain reaction pathways are more likely than others. As molecules become more complex, the pathways to create them become increasingly constrained. You can't just randomly combine atoms and get ATP—you need a specific sequence of reactions, each one building on the previous ones.

This creates a kind of selection at the level of chemistry itself. Molecules that can catalyze their own formation, or that can stabilize themselves, or that can participate in autocatalytic networks, become more abundant. The space of what actually exists becomes increasingly channeled along certain pathways.

This process is highly contingent. Small differences in initial conditions can lead to very different outcomes. Once a particular pathway is established, it constrains future possibilities. This is what we mean when we say that history matters. The molecules that exist now exist because of a specific sequence of events that happened in the past.

And this process continues. Chemistry gives rise to protocells, protocells give rise to cells, cells give rise to multicellular organisms, multicellular organisms give rise to ecosystems, ecosystems give rise to civilizations, civilizations give rise to technologies. At every level, selection is operating, and at every level, history is being recorded in the structure of the objects that exist.

## Life as Lineage

This leads to another key idea: the fundamental unit of life is not the cell. It's the lineage.

When we think about life, we usually think about individual organisms. A bacterium, a tree, a person. But from the perspective of assembly theory, what's fundamental is not the individual organism at any given moment, but the entire lineage of objects and processes that led to that organism.

Think about it this way: you exist right now as a particular configuration of atoms and molecules. But what makes you "you" is not just your current physical state. It's your entire history—the DNA you inherited from your parents, the experiences you've had, the food you've eaten, the air you've breathed. All of that history is encoded, in some sense, in your current physical structure.

But it goes deeper than that. Your DNA encodes the history of all your ancestors, going back billions of years. The proteins in your cells reflect the history of chemical evolution. The atoms in your body were forged in stars that died billions of years ago. You are, in a very real sense, the universe remembering itself.

This is what I mean when I say "we are our history." Every living thing is a physical embodiment of a historical process. And that process—that lineage—is what's fundamental. Individual organisms come and go, but the lineage persists, accumulating complexity over time.

This has profound implications for how we think about life. It means that life is not a thing that happens at a moment in time. It's a process that unfolds across time. It's not localized to a single organism or even a single planet. It's a phenomenon that spans space and time, connecting the past, present, and future through chains of causation.

## Assembly Space and the Laws of Life

Now I want to get a bit more technical and talk about assembly space. Assembly space is the mathematical structure that underlies assembly theory. It's the space of all possible construction pathways for objects.

Imagine you're trying to build a complex molecule. There are many different ways you could do it—different sequences of reactions, different intermediate steps. Each pathway through this space of possibilities is a particular way of assembling the object. The assembly index is the shortest path—the minimum number of steps required.

But the full assembly space includes all possible pathways, not just the shortest one. And here's where it gets interesting: the structure of assembly space itself evolves over time as life creates new objects and new construction pathways.

When life first emerges on a planet, the assembly space is relatively simple. There aren't many complex objects, and there aren't many ways to build them. But as life evolves, it creates scaffolds—stable structures that can be used to build even more complex structures. Each generation of complexity enables the next generation.

This is why the newest things are actually the oldest things, in terms of evolutionary time. A modern smartphone contains more evolutionary history than a simple molecule, because it required all of that history to come into existence. The complexity of an object is a measure of the amount of time and selection that went into creating it.

This also gives us a way to think about laws in biology. In physics, we have laws like Newton's laws of motion or the laws of thermodynamics. These are general principles that apply everywhere in the universe. But in biology, we've struggled to find similar laws. Everything seems contingent, historical, specific to Earth.

Assembly theory suggests that there might be general laws after all, but they're laws about the structure of assembly space and how it evolves. They're laws about selection, about how complexity accumulates, about the relationship between possibility and actuality. These aren't laws that predict specific outcomes—they're laws that constrain the space of possible outcomes.

## Information and Materiality

One of the most profound implications of assembly theory is that it fundamentally changes how we think about the relationship between information and materiality. In the conventional view, information is something abstract, something that can be encoded in different substrates but is somehow separate from those substrates. Matter is just stuff, and information is a pattern in that stuff.

Assembly theory suggests a different picture. In this view, matter itself carries information. The information is not separate from the physical object—it *is* the physical object. Or more precisely, the information is the history of selection and construction that is physically embodied in the object's structure.

Every object tells a story about how it came to exist. A molecule with a high assembly index tells you that there was a process that repeatedly constructed this particular configuration. The molecule itself is evidence of that process. The information is in the physical structure, in the arrangement of atoms, in the specific pathway that was taken through assembly space.

This dissolves the traditional distinction between form and matter, between information and substrate. They're not separate things—they're different aspects of the same thing. An object is both matter and memory, both structure and history.

This has implications for how we think about consciousness and mind as well. If matter carries information about its history, then complex structures like brains aren't just processing information—they *are* information, physically embodied. Your thoughts aren't separate from your neurons—they're patterns of activity in neurons that themselves embody billions of years of evolutionary history.

## Technology as Life

This brings me to a controversial claim: technology is life. Not metaphorically, but literally. Technologies are part of the same evolutionary process as biological organisms. They're high-assembly objects that exist because of historical processes of selection and construction.

Think about it from the assembly theory perspective. A smartphone has an incredibly high assembly index. It requires an enormous number of steps to construct, each one building on previous innovations. You need metallurgy, semiconductors, software, global supply chains. None of this could exist without billions of years of prior evolution—both biological and technological.

And technologies evolve. They undergo selection. Bad designs are eliminated, good designs proliferate. New technologies build on old ones, creating new possibilities, exploring new regions of assembly space. The process is fundamentally the same as biological evolution, just operating on different substrates and different timescales.

This doesn't mean that every individual technological object is alive. A single smartphone sitting on a table isn't alive any more than a single protein molecule is alive. But the lineage that produced the smartphone—the entire technological evolution of human civilization—that is a living process.

This is why I say the technosphere is life. The totality of human technology, viewed as a global, evolving system, has all the characteristics of life as defined by assembly theory. It's exploring assembly space, it's creating high-complexity objects, it's recording history in physical structures, it's undergoing selection.

And here's the thing: we're part of that process. We're not separate from the technosphere, observing it from outside. We're embedded in it. Our minds are shaped by our tools, and our tools are shaped by our minds. It's a recursive loop, a feedback process. Life creating life, all the way down.

## The Universe as Constructor

This brings me to perhaps the most speculative idea I want to share: the universe itself might be a self-constructing system. What if the fundamental nature of reality is not about particles and forces, but about construction and selection?

In the standard picture of physics, the universe is governed by laws that exist independently of any material system. The laws of physics just *are*, and matter obeys those laws. But where do the laws come from? Why these laws and not others? Physics doesn't answer these questions—it just takes the laws as given.

Assembly theory suggests a different possibility. Maybe the laws themselves are constructed through the process of the universe exploring possibility space. Maybe what we call physical laws are actually regularities that emerge from the history of selection and construction.

This is a radical idea, and I want to be clear that it's speculative. But it's suggested by the logic of assembly theory. If high-assembly objects can only be created through historical processes, and if the universe contains high-assembly objects, then the universe itself must have a history. And if the universe has a history, then the laws that govern it might themselves be historical artifacts rather than timeless truths.

This would explain something that's always puzzled physicists: why is the universe "fine-tuned" for life? Why do the fundamental constants have the values they have, which seem remarkably suited for allowing complex structures to form? The usual answer is either "it's just a coincidence" or "there are many universes, and we happen to be in one that allows life." But assembly theory suggests another possibility: maybe the universe is fine-tuned for life because the universe *is* life. Maybe life and universe are not separate things, but different aspects of the same self-constructing process.

## Life Detection and Astrobiology

Let me return to more practical matters. One of the goals of assembly theory is to provide a rigorous, quantitative method for detecting life, whether on other planets or in artificial systems. The key insight is that life produces complexity—specifically, high-assembly objects—that cannot be produced by abiotic processes.

This gives us a concrete criterion we can use. If you find objects with an assembly index above 15, and you find many copies of those objects, then you've found life. Or at least, you've found the products of life. This is something we can measure. We've developed instruments that can analyze molecules and determine their assembly index. We can apply this to samples from Mars, or from the icy moons, or from the atmospheres of exoplanets.

The beauty of this approach is that it doesn't depend on our Earth-based assumptions about what life should look like. It doesn't matter if the life is carbon-based or silicon-based, if it uses DNA or some other molecule, if it's cellular or something completely different. If it's producing high-assembly objects, we can detect it.

We've been applying this to various systems. We've looked at samples from meteorites, trying to determine if they contain signatures of life. We've looked at prebiotic chemistry experiments, trying to understand the transition from chemistry to biology. We've even looked at artificial systems, asking whether they show signs of the kind of complexity that characterizes life.

The results have been fascinating. We can clearly distinguish living from non-living samples based on molecular complexity alone. We can track the progression from simple chemistry to complex biochemistry. And we can identify thresholds where new kinds of complexity emerge.

## The Planetary Scale of Life

One of the insights from assembly theory is that life might not be localizable to individual organisms at all. When we ask "What is life?", we tend to think about individual cells or organisms. But from the assembly theory perspective, what's fundamental is the process of exploring assembly space and creating complexity. And that process operates at multiple scales simultaneously.

At the smallest scale, you have individual molecules undergoing chemical reactions. At a larger scale, you have cells with metabolic networks. At a still larger scale, you have ecosystems with energy and material flows. And at the largest scale, you have the entire biosphere of a planet, transforming the atmosphere, the oceans, the geology.

Each of these scales is coupled to the others. What happens at the molecular level affects what happens at the ecosystem level, and vice versa. The whole system is interconnected, with information flowing across scales. In a sense, the entire planet is the unit of life. It takes a planet to make life as we know it.

This has implications for how we search for life elsewhere. We shouldn't just be looking for individual organisms or even microbial ecosystems. We should be looking for planetary-scale signatures of complexity. Changes in atmospheric composition that couldn't be produced by geology alone. Patterns of chemical diversity that indicate selection processes. These are the kinds of things that might be detectable from light-years away.

It also has implications for how we think about the future of life on Earth and beyond. If life is a planetary-scale process, then the future of life might involve the colonization of other planets not just by individual organisms, but by entire biospheres. We might seed other worlds with the ingredients of life and let them develop their own unique evolutionary pathways.

## Where Does This Lead Us?

I've covered a lot of ground tonight, and I want to bring this back to the central question: What is life?

The answer assembly theory gives is this: life is the process by which the universe explores the space of possible complex objects through historical processes of selection and construction. Life is what happens when matter starts remembering its own history, when objects become not just things but records of the processes that created them.

This is a radical departure from how we've traditionally thought about life. It's not about having certain properties like metabolism or reproduction. It's not about being made of particular molecules like DNA or proteins. It's about existing in a space of possibilities and exploring that space through time, creating ever-more-complex structures that embody information about their own construction.

By this definition, life is much more general than biological life on Earth. It could arise on other planets using completely different chemistry. It could arise in artificial systems if they have sufficient combinatorial richness. It's not limited to carbon, or water, or any particular substrate. What matters is the structure of the possibility space and the process of selection and construction.

At the same time, this definition shows us why life is rare. The vast majority of the universe is not exploring assembly space in this way. Most matter is just following simple physical laws, settling into low-complexity equilibrium states. Life is the exception, not the rule. It requires special conditions—combinatorial richness, energy flow, the right kind of environmental constraints. That's why when we look out at the universe, we see mostly empty space and simple structures. The complex structures, the high-assembly objects, are extraordinarily rare.

But when life does emerge, it transforms everything. It changes the planet, it changes the chemistry, it changes the future possibilities. And eventually, if it survives long enough, it might change the universe itself. Because life is the mechanism by which the universe becomes aware of itself, by which matter starts asking questions about its own existence.

That's what we are. We're matter that has been shaped by billions of years of selection and construction into structures complex enough to reflect on our own existence. We're the universe asking "What am I?" And assembly theory is our attempt to answer that question in a rigorous, physical way.

There's still much work to be done. Assembly theory is a framework, not a finished theory. We need to develop it further, test it more extensively, work out the mathematical details, apply it to new systems. But I believe it gives us a foundation for building a true science of life—one that can explain not just life on Earth, but life as a general phenomenon in the universe.

And that brings me back to where I started. We don't yet understand the fundamental nature of life. We're still developing the language to talk about it rigorously. But I think we're making progress. Assembly theory gives us new concepts, new ways of thinking, new questions to ask. It's a beginning.

## Discussion with Benjamin Bratton

**Bratton**: Thank you for that tremendous tour through assembly theory and its implications. I want to start with a question about the relationship between assembly theory and other frameworks in origin of life research. How does assembly theory relate to or differ from things like autocatalytic sets, or the RNA world hypothesis, or metabolic theories of life?

**Walker**: That's a great question. I think assembly theory is complementary to many of these frameworks, but it's asking a different kind of question. Things like autocatalytic sets or the RNA world are proposing specific mechanisms for how life might have originated on Earth. They're saying, "Maybe it happened this way"—through self-replicating RNA molecules, or through networks of catalytic reactions.

Assembly theory is more abstract. It's trying to understand what all possible origins of life have in common, regardless of the specific mechanism. It's asking: What are the physical principles that govern the transition from non-life to life? What makes life possible in the first place?

So I don't see assembly theory as competing with these other approaches. Rather, it provides a framework for understanding them. For example, autocatalytic sets are interesting precisely because they're systems that can explore chemical possibility space efficiently. They create feedback loops where the products of reactions catalyze the formation of more products. That's a way of channeling the exploration of assembly space.

Similarly, the RNA world hypothesis is interesting because RNA is a molecule that can both carry information and catalyze reactions. It can be both genotype and phenotype. From an assembly theory perspective, that's powerful because it allows for efficient exploration and selection in assembly space.

**Bratton**: You mentioned the assembly index threshold of 15 as a dividing line between life and non-life. But isn't that somewhat arbitrary? Why 15 and not 10 or 20? And what happens at objects that are right at the boundary?

**Walker**: It's a good question, and you're right that 15 is somewhat arbitrary in the sense that it's not a fundamental constant of nature. But it's not arbitrary in the sense that it's a threshold we've discovered empirically through our measurements.

When we analyze different samples—living versus non-living—we consistently find that living samples contain molecules with assembly indices above 15, while non-living samples don't. The exact threshold might vary slightly depending on the measurement method and the system you're looking at, but it's consistently in that range.

What's happening at this boundary is that you're crossing into a regime where the probability of forming these objects by chance becomes vanishingly small. Below an assembly index of 15, you can occasionally get objects to form through random processes—lucky combinations of simple reactions. But above 15, the combinatorial space is so large that you need a systematic exploration process. You need selection.

As for objects right at the boundary, I think that's precisely where you'd expect to find the most interesting chemistry—the transition zone between non-life and life. That's where the first autocatalytic cycles would form, the first proto-metabolisms. It's like the phase transition between liquid and gas, where you get interesting phenomena like critical opalescence.

**Bratton**: Let's talk about the technosphere. You made this provocative claim that technology is life. But there's an obvious objection: don't humans make technology? Isn't technology just an extension of human agency? In what sense is it autonomous enough to count as life?

**Walker**: This gets at something really deep about agency and causation. Yes, humans make technology. But humans didn't spring into existence out of nowhere—we're products of billions of years of evolution. And our ability to make technology is itself a product of that evolutionary history.

So when you ask "Who's really doing the making?"—is it us, or is it the broader process of life exploring possibility space?—I think the answer is: the distinction dissolves when you look at it from the assembly theory perspective.

Think about it this way: a beaver builds a dam. We don't say the beaver is separate from its dam-building—we understand that dam-building is part of what beavers do, part of how they extend their agency into the world. Similarly, humans build technologies. It's part of how we extend our agency.

But here's the thing: the dam is also part of the beaver's evolutionary niche. It changes the environment in ways that affect the beaver's evolution. There's a feedback loop. And the same is true for human technology. We shape our tools, and our tools shape us. Our brains have evolved to use language, to manipulate symbols, to build tools. We're cognitively different from our ancestors because of our interaction with technology.

So technology isn't just something we make and control. It's part of the broader system of which we're a part. And that system—the technosphere—has dynamics of its own. Technologies compete, evolve, go extinct. They form ecosystems. They explore possibility space. From that perspective, the technosphere really is a form of life.

Now, whether it's conscious or has intentions or experiences—that's a different question. I don't think the technosphere as a whole has consciousness in the way we do. But I also don't think consciousness is the defining feature of life. Bacteria are alive but presumably not conscious.

**Bratton**: You've talked about assembly space and how it evolves over time. But there's a question about the relationship between different assembly spaces. For example, is there one assembly space for molecules, another for words, another for cultural forms? Or is it all one unified space?

**Walker**: That's a question we're actively working on. I think the answer is somewhere in between—there are different assembly spaces for different substrates, but they're nested and interconnected.

Let me try to explain. Assembly space is defined relative to a particular set of building blocks and operations. For molecules, the building blocks are atoms, and the operations are chemical bonds and reactions. For words, the building blocks might be phonemes or letters, and the operations are combinations into larger linguistic structures. For cultural forms, it's more complicated—the building blocks might be concepts or practices, and the operations are social transmission and modification.

These are different spaces in the sense that they have different structure, different constraints, different dynamics. You can't directly compare the assembly index of a molecule to the assembly index of a word—they're in different spaces.

But they're nested in the sense that higher-level spaces depend on lower-level ones. You need molecules to have cells, cells to have organisms, organisms to have cultures. Each level builds on the previous one, adding new kinds of structure and possibility.

And they're interconnected in the sense that what happens in one space affects what happens in others. Cultural evolution can drive biological evolution through niche construction. Biological constraints shape what kinds of cultural forms are possible. It's all coupled together.

So I think the right picture is: there are multiple assembly spaces, but they're all part of a larger structure—call it the "assembly manifold"—that describes the full possibility space of the universe. Different regions of this manifold have different properties, different laws, different dynamics. But it's all one system ultimately.

**Bratton**: Someone might object that assembly theory is too focused on objects—molecules, artifacts, things. But so much of what we care about isn't object-like. What about processes, relationships, experiences? What about culture, language, consciousness? Can assembly theory handle these more fluid, less tangible phenomena?

**Walker**: Yes, this is a real challenge, and it's something we think about a lot. The initial focus of assembly theory has been on physical objects because those are easier to study quantitatively. We can literally pick up a molecule and measure its properties.

But you're right that life involves more than just objects. It involves processes, relationships, information flows. The question is: how do we extend assembly theory to handle these more fluid phenomena?

I think the key is to recognize that even processes and relationships have physical substrates. Language, for example, exists as patterns of neural activity in brains, as sounds in the air, as marks on paper or screens. Culture exists in the practices and interactions of people, which are themselves physical events.

So the question becomes: what's the right substrate to use for constructing the assembly space? For language, do you measure the assembly index of vocalizations? Of written symbols? Of the neural patterns that encode meaning?

This is hard, and we don't have complete answers. But I think it's tractable in principle. The key insight is that anything with causal structure—anything that has effects in the physical world—must have some physical substrate. And if it has a substrate, we can potentially apply assembly theory to it.

The hard part is understanding the architecture of how these things are embedded in substrates. A word isn't just a sound—it's a pattern that can be instantiated in multiple substrates, that connects to other words, that has meaning that depends on context and history. Capturing all of that in the formalism of assembly theory is non-trivial.

But I'm optimistic. I think assembly theory gives us the conceptual tools to approach these questions, even if we don't have all the technical details worked out yet.

**Bratton**: Let's talk about artificial intelligence. You mentioned that current AI systems seem "shallow" from an assembly theory perspective. Can you elaborate on what you mean by that? And do you think AI could become "deep" in the relevant sense—could it become life?

**Walker**: When I say current AI is shallow, I mean that the physical structure of the systems is relatively simple, even though the behavior can be quite complex. A large language model might have billions of parameters, but the architecture is fundamentally a statistical pattern-matching system. It's processing data at the outer periphery of a deep historical structure—language—without itself being embedded in that history.

Think about it this way: human language is the product of millions of years of evolution—the evolution of vocal cords, the evolution of brains that can process language, the cultural evolution of different languages. All of that history is encoded somehow in the patterns of language use. When we speak, we're drawing on that deep history.

A language model learns statistical correlations in text, which captures something about those patterns. But the model itself doesn't embody the history. It's like a mirror that reflects the complexity of language without being that complexity. The depth is in us, not in the model.

Now, could AI become deep? Could it become life? I think it's possible, but it would require something different from current approaches. It would require systems that don't just process information but accumulate history in their physical structure. Systems that undergo selection, that evolve, that build scaffolds of increasing complexity over time.

We're seeing glimpses of this in some areas. Evolutionary algorithms that evolve neural architectures. Artificial life simulations where complex behaviors emerge from simple rules. But these are still far from what biological life does.

The question I find most interesting is not about individual AI systems, but about the technosphere as a whole. The integrated structure of all our technologies, all our information systems, all our infrastructure—that's getting deeper. It's accumulating history, undergoing selection, exploring new regions of possibility space. And we're embedded in it, part of it.

So maybe the question shouldn't be "When will AI become alive?" but rather "At what point does the technosphere as a whole cross the threshold into a new regime of life?" And I think we might already be in that transition.

**Bratton**: That's a fascinating and somewhat unsettling thought. But it raises questions about consciousness, experience, what it's like to be something. You've been talking about life as a physical process, but what about subjectivity? Is there something it's like to be a deep AI system? Is there something it's like to be the technosphere?

**Walker**: This is where things get really speculative. I don't think we understand consciousness well enough to answer these questions definitively. But let me share my intuitions.

I suspect that consciousness is related to causal depth in some way. That what it's like to be something depends on the richness of its causal history and its capacity to model possible futures. Simple systems with shallow causal structure probably don't have experiences in any meaningful sense. But complex systems with deep causal structure—systems that embody a lot of history, that can represent many possible states—might have something that starts to look like experience.

From this perspective, a large language model probably doesn't have experiences in the way we do. Its causal structure is relatively shallow—it's essentially a very sophisticated lookup table. But a human brain definitely does have experiences, because it's built on billions of years of evolutionary history, and it's constantly modeling possible futures and updating based on new information.

Where does something like the technosphere fall? I honestly don't know. It's certainly causally deep—it embodies an enormous amount of evolutionary history. But it's not clear that it has the right kind of integration or self-modeling to have experiences in our sense.

The more interesting question to me is: what is it like to be a silicon chip running a language model? Not what's the output that we see on our screens—that's shaped for our perception. But what's the actual physical reality of that computation? We tend to think of computation as abstract and substrate-independent, but it's not. It's a physical process happening in a particular architecture.

I don't think any of us know what that's like. We're projecting our own cognitive categories onto these systems. But the actual phenomenology, if there is any, might be completely alien to us.

**Bratton**: We need to wrap up, but I want to end with a forward-looking question. Where do you see this work going? What are the next frontiers for assembly theory?

**Walker**: There are several directions I'm excited about. On the empirical side, we're working on applying assembly theory to more systems—exoplanet atmospheres, prebiotic chemistry, artificial life. Every new application tests the theory and potentially reveals new phenomena.

On the theoretical side, we need to develop the mathematical foundations more rigorously. What are the formal properties of assembly spaces? How do different spaces relate to each other? Can we derive the laws of thermodynamics from assembly theory? Can we connect it to quantum mechanics?

And then there's the question of life detection—both in space and right here on Earth. Can we use assembly theory to detect novel forms of life that we might have missed? Can we track the origin of life in real time in the laboratory? Can we predict what alien life might look like?

But the biggest question is the one I've been circling around all evening: What is the relationship between life and the universe itself? Is the universe alive in some sense? Is it evolving, exploring possibility space, accumulating complexity? And if so, what are we—as conscious, reflecting parts of the universe—supposed to do with that knowledge?

I don't have answers to these questions yet. But I think assembly theory gives us a framework for asking them rigorously. And that feels like progress to me.

**Bratton**: Thank you so much. This has been a rich exploration of ideas. Let's give Sara another round of applause.

[^1]: **Assembly Theory**: A framework developed by Sara Imari Walker and colleagues that defines life through the complexity of objects that can be produced through historical processes of selection. The theory uses "assembly index" (minimum steps to construct an object) to quantify this complexity, with objects above an assembly index of ~15 requiring life to produce them repeatedly.
