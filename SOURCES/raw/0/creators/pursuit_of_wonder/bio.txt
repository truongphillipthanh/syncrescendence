Pursuit of Wonder was created by Robert Pantano, a writer and author who initially planned to publish a book exploring philosophical ideas about meaning, self, and existence. After facing rejection from traditional publishers, he decided to create a YouTube channel to share his work.

Background and origins
- The book that wasn't: Pantano's initial project was a manuscript inspired by the feeling that important aspects of living an authentic life were not being adequately discussed. When it was rejected by agents and publishers, he chose to independently share its concepts through video essays on YouTube.
- The channel is born: The Pursuit of Wonder YouTube channel was established as a vehicle for sharing these philosophical ideas in an engaging and accessible way. Its success allowed the project to expand beyond video content.
- Evolution of purpose: What began as a personal drive to pursue curiosity evolved into a broader mission. The project now aims to "foster reflection through powerful ideas and stories" related to philosophy, psychology, science, literature, and well-being.

Key themes and approach
- Accessible philosophy: The content explores complex concepts from various philosophical traditions, including nihilism, existentialism, and Eastern philosophy, but presents them in a way that is easy for a general audience to grasp.
- Stories and thought experiments: Many videos are short, fictional stories or thought experiments designed to challenge viewers' perspectives on fundamental questions, such as the nature of reality, identity, and consciousness.
- Embracing uncertainty: A core theme is encouraging a comfort with the absurdity and uncertainty of existence. By facing life's complexities head-on, the project aims to inspire a sense of "child-like wonder".

Expansion into publishing
- Author Robert Pantano: Building on the channel's success, Pantano began publishing books under the Pursuit of Wonder umbrella. His first book, The Art of Living a Meaningless Existence, is a collection of essays based on the ideas from his original manuscript.
- Future releases: Pantano has continued to write and publish, with a new book, The Terrible Paradox of Self-Awareness, set for release in 2026.
- Collaborations: The brand has also expanded to include works by other authors. In 2024, Pursuit of Wonder published So You're Having an Existential Crisis, the debut book by Ben Thomas (known as Sisyphus 55).
