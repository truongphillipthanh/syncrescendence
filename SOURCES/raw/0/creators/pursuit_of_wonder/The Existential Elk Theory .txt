In this video, we explore the life and philosophy of Peter Wessel Zapffe—one of the most the pessimistic philosophers in history. Zapffe's work brings our consciousness into question. Is it a good or bad thing to be as aware of existence as we are? What are the consequences? What must we endure?

One night in long bygone times, man
0:12
awoke and saw himself. He saw that he
0:15
was naked under cosmos, homeless in his
0:17
own body. All things dissolved before
0:19
his testing thought. Wonder above
0:21
wonder, horror above horror unfolded in
0:24
his mind. Peter Vessel Zapa.
0:28
Hundreds of thousands of years ago, a
0:30
species known as the Irish elk, often
0:32
referred to as the giant deer, emerged.
0:35
Up until just a few thousand years ago,
0:37
this creature roamed Eurasia as one of
0:39
the largest deer species to have ever
0:40
lived. Standing at around 7 ft tall, 10
0:43
ft long, and with massive antlers
0:45
spanning up to 12 ft across, millions of
0:48
years of evolution led to the immense
0:50
size and proportions of this giant deer
0:52
and its antlers. Their antlers were
0:54
weapons forged by and wielded against
0:56
nature, used for mating, display, and
0:58
survival in a highly competitive and
1:00
gruesome world. After a certain point,
1:03
however, as these antlers continued to
1:05
grow, their use and function were
1:07
eclipsed by the problems they imposed
1:08
onto the species. The antlers weighed
1:10
their heads down and made swift mobility
1:12
in most environments essentially
1:14
impossible. They could no longer easily
1:16
navigate the forest to quickly evade
1:18
predators and human hunters, and access
1:20
to nutrition could not readily sustain
1:22
the overgrowth of their antlers, often
1:24
leading to nutritional deficiencies in
1:26
the rest of the body. What was supposed
1:28
to be a feature for survival and
1:29
thriving turned into an obstruction of
1:31
these very goals, a maladaptation of
1:34
evolution. In the end, these overgrown
1:37
horns ultimately contributed to the
1:39
giant deer going extinct in the year
1:42
5700 B.C.E.
1:45
Alongside the Irish elks existence and
1:47
extinction was humankind's emergence and
1:49
evolution. By the time the giant deer
1:52
had reached its fate, humanity and
1:54
civilization had long since formed,
1:56
playing a role in the deer's demise
1:57
through hunting. With the most advanced
1:59
form of consciousness the planet had yet
2:01
seen, humanity not only roamed but
2:03
assumed the planet. Millions of years of
2:06
evolution led to the unique form of
2:08
consciousness found inside the heads of
2:10
humankind. This consciousness is a
2:12
weapon forged by and wielded against
2:14
nature. A means of survival and thriving
2:17
in a highly gruesome and competitive
2:19
world. Though this consciousness has
2:21
allowed for achievements like highly
2:22
organized hunting, agriculture,
2:24
morality, civilization, and industry,
2:27
20th century Norwegian philosopher Peter
2:29
Vessel Zapva argued that our
2:31
consciousness also exhibits the same
2:33
maladaptive evolutionary qualities as
2:35
the antlers of the giant deer. Our
2:38
consciousness, Zappa argued, has
2:40
extended past its practical functions,
2:42
leaving us with an excess weight and
2:44
size of awareness that we don't know
2:46
what to do with, and that has turned
2:47
existence into a problem for us. A
2:50
superolous outgrowth of nature destined
2:52
to extinguish its harborer. Zappa
2:54
writes, "Life had overshot its target,
2:57
blowing itself apart. A species had been
3:00
armed too heavily by spirit made
3:01
almighty without, but equally a menace
3:04
to its own well-being. Its weapon was
3:06
like a sword without hilt or plate, a
3:08
two-edged blade cleaving everything. But
3:10
he who is to wield it must grasp the
3:12
blade and turn the one edge toward
3:14
himself.
3:16
Zappa was born in 1899 in Trazzo,
3:19
Norway. Much of his life was split
3:21
between three areas that seem, at least
3:23
on the face of them, quite different.
3:26
Mountaineering, law, and existential
3:28
philosophy, which he expressed in both
3:30
academic and artistic forms. Despite
3:33
writing about the deepest creasses of
3:35
despair and anxiety, Zapa spent a
3:37
substantial amount of his life ascending
3:39
the literal heights of mountains,
3:41
becoming a notable early member of the
3:43
Norwegian rock climbing community and
3:45
the first to ascend several peaks across
3:46
the Scandinavian mountains. In 1923,
3:50
after obtaining his degree from the
3:51
University of Oslo, he also became a
3:53
lawyer, though his focus quickly moved
3:55
away from law. Underscoring his life and
3:58
what Zapa is most widely known for was
4:00
his perceptiveness and work in
4:02
literature and philosophy. With
4:04
profoundly intense and melancholic pros,
4:06
his philosophical work can bring even
4:08
the most innocent unthinking individual
4:10
down from the peaks of optimism and into
4:12
the valleys of uncertainty, at least if
4:15
they're not prepared for the journey.
4:18
What connected much of Zapa's work,
4:20
sensibilities, and life in general
4:22
appeared to be an intense awareness of
4:24
death. More specifically, he exhibited a
4:26
kind of death anxiety that contributed
4:28
to a highly lucid awareness of human
4:30
awareness itself, our sensitivity
4:32
towards suffering, decay, and futility,
4:35
and the interplay these things have with
4:36
the human desire for meaning and solace.
4:39
In 1933, at age 34, Zapa published his
4:43
first philosophical work, an essay
4:45
titled The Last Messiah, a short but
4:47
devastating piece that with the
4:49
precision of the tip of a nail shatters
4:51
the tempered glass of comfortable and
4:53
socially acceptable ideals. 8 years
4:56
later, in 1941, he expanded on the
4:58
concepts of the essay in his book, On
5:01
the Tragic. In these works, Zapo
5:04
measures the weight and size of human
5:05
consciousness as it teeters back and
5:07
forth inside the human skull. Like the
5:09
antlers of the giant deer, he argues
5:11
that consciousness weighs us down with
5:13
its immense awareness, revealing to us
5:14
the conditions of being in all its
5:16
horrors. We see in plain sight that we
5:19
are subjected to and limited by the
5:21
corporeality of the body, controlled by
5:23
the laws of a chaotic and unknowable
5:25
reality, and abandoned by the universe
5:27
in our need for meaning and redemption.
5:30
For Zapva, like the antlers of the giant
5:32
deer, this seems like it would make
5:34
long-term survival for humanity very
5:36
unlikely. In his words, he has lost his
5:39
right of residence in the universe. Has
5:41
eaten from the tree of knowledge and
5:43
been expelled from paradise. He is
5:45
mighty in the near world, but curses his
5:47
might as purchased with his harmony of
5:49
soul, his innocence, his inner peace in
5:52
life's embrace.
5:54
And yet, of course, humanity has endured
5:57
for hundreds of thousands of years,
5:59
thrived. This left Zapoa wondering why.
6:03
Why has humanity endured its apparently
6:05
futile, terrifying, and absurd condition
6:07
with such fervor? And perhaps more
6:10
accurately, how in the face of no clear
6:13
definitive wise, how does humanity
6:15
continue on and deal with such lucid
6:17
awareness of the inherent tragedy of its
6:19
existence? For the giant deer, Zapa
6:22
points out that if it could have cut or
6:23
trimmed its horns every time they grew
6:25
too large, it could have relieved itself
6:27
of the antler's burden and increased the
6:29
likelihood of survival individually and
6:31
collectively. Of course, however, they
6:34
couldn't do this. They were dear.
6:36
Humans, however, can do something like
6:39
this. In a sense, we can shave down and
6:42
saw off our antlers. We can dilute and
6:44
soften our consciousness, using it for
6:46
less than it is capable of and leaving
6:48
much of what it affords us untouched and
6:50
unexamined. And this is what Zappa
6:53
believes we do. How we endure and
6:55
survive. He writes, "Cultural history as
6:59
well as observation of ourselves and
7:00
others allow the following answer. Most
7:03
people learn to save themselves by
7:05
artificially limiting the content of
7:07
consciousness."
7:09
Specifically, Zappa argues that there
7:11
are four primary methods by which we do
7:12
this. Isolation, anchoring, distraction,
7:16
and sublimation.
7:18
Isolation essentially boils down to
7:20
deliberate or unconscious ignorance.
7:23
That is, ignoring or repressing thoughts
7:25
about the reality of our condition.
7:27
Despite horrific and unfathomable
7:29
qualities, arguably being so fundamental
7:31
to our nature and experience of
7:33
existence, both our minds and our
7:34
conversations almost never bring them
7:36
up. This is clear in the conventions of
7:38
most social interactions. It is bad
7:40
decorum to bring up death, suffering,
7:43
the absurdity of reason, and the
7:44
futility of everything in most
7:46
conversations. And so, by not talking
7:49
about these existential matters, and
7:50
better yet, not thinking about them, we
7:53
essentially operate in the same way we
7:54
would toward a young child, but toward
7:56
ourselves. That is, we selfshelter. We
8:00
change the TV station to cartoons. We
8:02
answer hard questions with simple
8:04
answers. And we deny the horrific and
8:06
complex truth of things, believing
8:08
everything will be okay.
8:10
Anchoring is similar, but on a more
8:13
organized social scale. It is the Santa
8:15
Clauses, Easter bunnies, and tooth
8:17
fairies we participate in and carry with
8:19
us into adulthood. It is the traditions
8:22
and systems we anchor to in order to
8:23
feel purpose and guidance around our
8:25
decisions and aims in life. According to
8:27
Zappa, the most common anchors include
8:29
God, the church, the state, morality,
8:32
fate, the law of life, the people, the
8:35
future.
8:37
Distraction refers to the explicit
8:39
actions individuals carry out on a
8:40
regular basis, often based on anchors,
8:43
to occupy one's mind away from thinking
8:45
about the reality of their condition. We
8:47
set up industries and markets so we can
8:49
carry out tasks and goals. We play and
8:52
watch sports and entertainment. We form
8:54
and sustain the responsibilities of
8:55
tradition and culture and so on. We
8:58
putter around and do menial things that
9:01
don't require the true force and
9:02
violence of our consciousness. It is
9:04
like playf fighting inconsequential
9:06
battles with swords made of nerf instead
9:08
of steel. We avoid the harm while
9:10
feeling a sense of active participation.
9:13
Lastly, sublimation refers to a sort of
9:16
creative process in which one takes the
9:18
dread and anxiety of existence and
9:20
transfigures it into something aesthetic
9:21
and expressive, functionally alchemizing
9:24
the suffering of human consciousness
9:25
into whatever human consciousness can
9:27
produce that is more pleasant or at the
9:30
very least novel. This is according to
9:32
Zapva the least common method but the
9:35
most powerful and self- embracing one.
9:38
The problem with all these defense
9:40
mechanisms for Zapva, including
9:42
sublimation, is that they are temporary
9:44
and self-destructive. They require
9:46
constant upkeep and constant denial of
9:49
what makes a human human. They do not
9:51
resolve or meaningfully face the root
9:53
cause, the nature of human
9:55
consciousness. Instead, they reject it
9:59
in the same way that if the giant deer
10:00
constantly trimmed its horns, it would
10:02
merely be self mutilating itself, having
10:04
to always be something other than what
10:06
it is. Zapa sees the defense mechanisms
10:08
of humankind as the same sort of
10:10
self-denial and mutilation. We gain
10:13
survival in continuence as a species,
10:15
but we lose ourselves as humans in full
10:18
form. To be truly whole in our
10:20
consciousness, according to Zapa, would
10:22
mean to see and know the reality of our
10:24
condition in all its horrors and
10:26
inongruities. This, however, would
10:28
equate to a sort of inevitable
10:30
annihilation of the species, as we would
10:32
determine it no longer sensible to
10:33
reproduce. Here we find a dilemma at the
10:37
foundation of human existence. We
10:39
possess both the desire to continue as a
10:41
species as well as the desire for
10:43
ultimate solace and purpose. Solace and
10:45
purpose, however, can never be obtained
10:47
through continuence because they cannot
10:49
really be obtained at all. Continuence
10:52
require sustained blind striving toward
10:54
these things that we can never achieve.
10:55
But realizing we can never achieve them,
10:57
at least at scale, would result in a
11:00
contradiction to our desire to continue.
11:02
And so these two binaries clash and
11:04
explode inside us. Their fragments
11:06
emerging at the top of our heads like
11:08
pointed horns of absurdity.
11:11
In his essay, the last messiah, Zapo
11:14
refers to a figure, the first and last
11:16
only real messiah of humanity. He
11:18
invokes this figure as an embodiment of
11:20
his philosophy, an individual who will
11:22
show humanity that its existence has no
11:24
redemption or higher meaning, only the
11:26
burdens of its awareness. And through
11:28
this, humankind would once and for all
11:30
see through the illusions and
11:32
self-deceptions and realize its despair
11:34
in full force, flopping its head forward
11:36
under the weight of their horns and
11:38
overcoming their fundamental nature to
11:40
propagate an end to humanity.
11:44
However, here Zapa seems to suggest,
11:47
albeit with ironic framing, that
11:49
humanity's options are either
11:50
selfdeception or self-extinction. But
11:53
perhaps there is another option, if not
11:55
many. Perhaps rather than the cessation
11:58
of the species, we can work to resolve
12:00
our dilemma through the sessation of our
12:02
dependency on resolutions, the need for
12:05
solace and purpose. Perhaps through a
12:07
slow and patient kind of exposure
12:09
therapy of our consciousness to our
12:11
consciousness, we can form an
12:12
indifference about it, a welcoming
12:14
embrace of our condition in full form.
12:17
The sessation of the human species,
12:19
which Zappa alludes to, suggests an
12:21
overcoming of the biological imperative
12:23
of reproduction. If we could overcome
12:25
that, could we not also instead overcome
12:28
our very need for purpose and redemption
12:31
and still survive and thrive?
12:34
Perhaps we can find our way not through
12:36
direction, but through the embrace of
12:37
aimlessness, through clearing the brush
12:40
of desire, of purpose, of hubris, of
12:43
certainty. Every path in the forest is
12:46
made through clearing, not amassing.
12:48
Though it seems Zapva on a philosophical
12:51
level would likely believe this not to
12:52
be a probable solution for humankind,
12:55
perhaps his life suggests otherwise. In
12:57
Zapa's life, he climbed mountains yet
13:00
unclimbed and forged ideas yet
13:02
unthought. He wrote literary works
13:04
discussing concepts that themselves
13:05
served as a sort of transcendent
13:07
sublimation, an overcoming of the very
13:09
conditions he wrote about while not
13:10
denying any truth of them. And this is
13:13
perhaps the perfect embodiment of both
13:15
the absurdity and the ability of
13:17
humankind. As a species, we have and
13:20
surely will continue to do the same. To
13:22
reach new peaks and new ideas, to face
13:24
up to reality, and to slowly but surely
13:27
transcend and transfigure. But we will
13:29
only do this so long as we continue
13:32
individually and collectively. If we
13:34
continue forward, we can survive. And if
13:37
we can survive, we can evolve. And if we
13:39
can evolve, we can improve and better
13:42
endure. We can better bear the weight at
13:45
top our necks. As our necks grow
13:46
stronger, our sightelines rise and the
13:49
landscape of the world opens up.
13:56
If you enjoy exploring ideas like these,
13:59
facing up to the realities of existence,
14:01
and grappling with consciousness, I'm
14:02
excited to share that my upcoming book
14:04
does just that. It's called The Terrible
14:07
Paradox of Self-awareness, and it's
14:09
coming out March 2026. It is perhaps my
14:12
darkest and most candid book yet, while
14:14
also deeply hopeful and redemptive. You
14:17
can pre-order your copy now by using the
14:18
link in the description, and sometimes
14:21
the best, or at least the most fun way
14:23
to wrestle with the existential topics
14:24
we read and learn about is discussing
14:26
them with friends. Perhaps debating them
14:28
over a couple drinks at the bar. A few
14:31
drinks can make for a very fervent
14:32
discussion about things like free will,
14:34
consciousness, and truth, but the next
14:36
day can sometimes suffer. This video
14:38

14:41
occasions, enjoying a night out with a
14:43
few drinks while preserving the next
14:44
