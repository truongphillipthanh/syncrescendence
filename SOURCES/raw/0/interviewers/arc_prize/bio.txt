The ARC Prize YouTube channel is run by the ARC Prize Foundation, a non-profit founded by François Chollet and Mike Knoop. Its content centers on the ARC-AGI benchmark, a competition designed to drive research toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) by measuring an AI's ability to efficiently learn new skills, rather than just its performance on known tasks.
ARC Prize YouTube channel
The channel's content documents the progress and vision of the ARC Prize. Key topics include:
- Competition updates: Announcing new prize competitions, like the ARC Prize 2025, and discussing the challenge of beating the ARC-AGI benchmark.
- AGI research: Exploring what it means to achieve AGI, focusing on the gap between what is simple for humans but remains difficult for AI.
- Technical deep-dives: Examining winning algorithms and innovative techniques like deep learning-guided program synthesis and test-time training.
- Interviews and fireside chats: Featuring discussions with the founders and other AI experts on topics ranging from the evolution of the ARC benchmark to the path toward AGI.
- Community and ecosystem: Highlighting the open-source spirit of the competition, which requires winners to publish their reproducible code and methods, and featuring research papers and startups inspired by the prize.
The founders
François Chollet
François Chollet is a highly influential AI researcher and the creator of the Keras deep-learning library, which has become a foundational tool in the field.
- Focus on intelligence: He authored the seminal paper "On the Measure of Intelligence", which lays the groundwork for the ARC-AGI benchmark. He argues that true intelligence is defined by the efficiency of acquiring new skills, not just memorizing patterns.
- Vision for AGI: Chollet believes AGI requires a fundamental shift in approach, moving away from large, slow, data-driven models toward systems that can reason and adapt on the fly.
- Current role: In addition to his work with the ARC Prize, he is a board member and co-founder and is also an engineer at Google.
Mike Knoop
Mike Knoop is a co-founder of the automation company Zapier and a co-founder of the ARC Prize.
- Builder and engineer: With a background in engineering and a focus on AI R&D, Knoop brings a practical, builder-oriented perspective to the mission of advancing AGI.
- Industry experience: At Zapier, he led the company's product and engineering and managed their partnership with OpenAI.
- Philanthropic drive: He co-funded the ARC Prize in 2024 with Chollet to direct AI research toward solving the core problems of general intelligence and foster an open-source community.
Greg Kamradt
Greg Kamradt serves as the President and a board member of the ARC Prize Foundation.
- Leadership role: Having co-led the 2024 competition, Kamradt was appointed to his role to lead the foundation's expansion into a proper non-profit organization.
- Community engagement: He is heavily involved in managing the prize's day-to-day operations and fostering the community of researchers and developers working on the benchmark.
