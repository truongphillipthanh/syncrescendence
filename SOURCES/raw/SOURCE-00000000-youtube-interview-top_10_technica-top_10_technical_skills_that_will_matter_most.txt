What if the most valuable tech skills in
0:02
2026 aren't the ones that everyone is
0:05
learning right now? I mean, in 2024,
0:08
prompt engineering was the buzzword. We
0:10
we all heard about it. Courses popped up
0:11
overnight. I mean, LinkedIn was full of
0:13
people claiming they mastered it. Or
0:16
maybe they did. But now, I mean, AI can
0:18
write and optimize its own prompts. So,
0:20
here's the question. If AI keeps
0:23
automating the technical work, what
0:26
skills will still make you valuable?
0:28
That's what I wanted to figure out. So I
0:30
dug around. I dug really deep through
0:32
reports from the World Economic Forum,
0:34
MIT, IBM, LinkedIn, Stanford that are
0:38
actually building these systems. And
0:40
what they all point to is this. The
0:42
future isn't about learning one tool.
0:45
It's about understanding the systems
0:47
behind the tools and how to think across
0:49
them. Now, the wild thing really is
0:52
about tech right now is it's not just
0:54
changing what we build. It's changing
0:56
how we build it. I mean every year new
0:58
frameworks drop, new AI tools launch,
1:01
new languages come rise and fall, but
1:04
all under it there's one invisible layer
1:07
that is making or breaking everything we
1:10
do, which is the network. I mean, think
1:12
about it. Your cloud environment, your
1:14
machine learning pipeline, your SAS
1:16
stack, none of it works if your network
1:18
isn't secure. Not only just secure, but
1:21
scalable and fast enough to keep up. And
1:23
yet networking is one of the least
1:25
modernized parts of our entire tech
1:28
stack. It's still fragmented with
1:30
separate vendors for hardware, software,
1:32
security, and ISPs. And most of it is
1:35
managed manually, which sounds so
1:38
outdated. That's a problem when today's
1:40
companies are scaling globally. I mean,
1:42
spinning up AI workloads across regions
1:44
and relying on real-time connectivity to
1:47
stay online. That is where Meter comes
1:49
in. And I'm really proud to have them as
1:51
the sponsor of today's video. By the
1:53
way, I linked them down below, so make
1:54
sure to go check them out. Meter builds
1:56
full stack networking infrastructure,
1:58
wired, wireless, and cellular, all
2:00
managed in one place. It's a kind of
2:02
solution that makes sense to anyone
2:04
who's ever had to deal with outages,
2:06
latency, or those dreaded who owns this
2:08
piece of the network moments. They
2:10
design, deploy, and manage everything
2:12
from the physical installation to the
2:14
ongoing operations. And they give teams
2:17
real visibility and control through a
2:19
unified dashboard. So instead of
2:21
juggling multiple vendors and legacy
2:22
systems, meter gives you a single
2:25
scalable foundation that grows with your
2:27
business. It's not just about better
2:29
Wi-Fi, it's about better infrastructure
2:31
that adapts to how modern companies
2:33
actually work, especially with
2:35
distributed teams, cloud first
2:37
workflows, and AI systems that depend on
2:40
high-speed reliability connectivity. In
2:43
short, they've built the kind of network
2:45
engineers have been wishing existed for
2:48
years, one that's programmable and
2:50
transparent as a software running on it.
2:52
And that idea, understanding the
2:54
invisible layers of technology, is
2:57
exactly what separates good
2:58
technologists from the great ones. Okay,
3:00
as a reminder, I linked them down below.
3:02
So, go learn more about Meter.
3:07
Okay, today we are breaking down the top
3:09
10 technical skills that will matter the
3:12
most in 2026, which is coming really
3:14
soon. Skills that aren't just about
3:15
knowing the latest tools, but about
3:17
understanding the systems that power
3:20
everything else. Right now, we're living
3:22
in what economists call the skills churn
3:24
era. So, listen to this. The World
3:26
Economic Forum's 2025 future jobs report
3:30
found that nearly half of all workers
3:32
will need reskilling by 2027. It's a
3:35
year and a half away because AI and
3:37
automation are changing the tasks we do
3:39
every single day. And yet when you look
3:40
at what actually lasts, the same pattern
3:43
shows up every single time. When the
3:45
internet arrived, everyone learned, say,
3:47
HTML. When mobile expanded, everyone
3:49
learned Swift or Cotlin. When cloud took
3:52
over, everyone rushed to AWS
3:54
certifications. But those who thrived
3:56
weren't chasing the frameworks. They
3:58
actually took the time to understand how
4:00
the pieces fit together. So instead of
4:02
asking yourself, what should I learn
4:03
this year? The better question is what
4:05
skills will matter no matter what AI
4:08
does next. The 10 skills that will
4:10
matter most researchers at MIT,
4:12
Stanford, IBM research describe this
4:14
next era as the systems phase of AI
4:17
which really means progress now depends
4:19
on how well humans can connect
4:21
technologies together. Here's what that
4:22
actually means for your skills though.
4:24
Let's start with one which is systems
4:26
thinking. So according to the MIT Sloan
4:29
School of Management, systems thinking
4:30
is one of the top meta skills for the AI
4:33
era. And this is because it lets you
4:35
understand how a local decision affects
4:37
a global system. So whether you're
4:39
designing an autonomous uh drone network
4:42
or an AI supply chain, systems thinkers
4:45
see dependencies others miss.
4:47
Performance bottlenecks, security
4:49
trade-offs, ethical side effects. It's a
4:51
skill that turns technologist into
4:53
architect. Now coming in at number two
4:55
is AI literacy. AI literacy doesn't mean
4:58
building a large model from scratch. It
5:00
means knowing how one works. A Stanford
5:03
study found that over 80% of technical
5:05
leaders now expect employees, even
5:07
outside of engineering, to understand
5:09
concepts like embeddings, vector
5:11
databases, and fine-tuning. So why is
5:13
this? Because those who actually
5:15
understand how AI thinks can evaluate
5:17
it, guide it, and spot bias before it
5:20
reach production. Coming in at number
5:21
three is data engineering. Every single
5:23
AI model is only as good as the data it
5:26
gets. Now, according to LinkedIn's 2024
5:28
workforce report, engineering has grown
5:31
50% faster than data science itself.
5:34
Companies have plenty of data
5:35
scientists, but too few people who can
5:38
actually clean, structure, and move that
5:40
data across systems reliably. If you
5:42
know how to build pipelines, you're
5:44
building the foundation for every AI
5:46
product that follows. Okay, coming in at
5:48
number four is cloud and edge computing.
5:50
We love the cloud still. It's not going
5:52
anywhere, but there are things changing.
5:54
So, the gardener emerging tech radar
5:56
predicts that by 2026 over 60% of AI
5:59
workloads will run at the edge on
6:01
devices, vehicles, and sensors, not in
6:04
the cloud. That means the next
6:05
generation of developers will need to
6:07
design hybrid systems, balancing what
6:09
runs locally for privacy and speed, and
6:11
what runs in the cloud for scale. Cloud
6:13
is table stakes. Edge will be the
6:16
differentiator. All right, coming in at
6:18
number five is cyber security and
6:20
privacy. Now, according to IBM's cost of
6:22
data breach report, the global average
6:24
breach now costs, hold on for the second
6:26
here, 4.88 million and attacks are
6:30
rising. In 2026, cyber security won't be
6:32
niche. It's a baseline you'll need to
6:35
know how zero trust networks work, how
6:37
to secure APIs and LLM endpoints, and
6:41
how to design with privacy by default.
6:43
Because in the AI era, trust is really
6:45
the new currency, the new data, if you
6:48
will. I don't know about that. All
6:49
right, coming in at number six is
6:51
automation and orchestration. So, here's
6:53
what McKenzie found. 70% of companies
6:55
are automating workflows, but listen to
6:57
this. Fewer than 15% have systems that
7:00
talk to each other. That is where
7:02
orchestration comes in. Connecting APIs,
7:04
data pipelines, and AI agents to
7:06
coordinate automatically. The skill here
7:08
isn't coding one specific task. It's
7:11
architecting the entire process. And
7:13
that's what multiplies productivity
7:15
across an organization. Number seven is
7:17
human AI collaboration. Now, a really
7:19
interesting Harvard Business Review
7:21
study showed that teams combining human
7:23
judgment with AI decision-making
7:25
outperformed pure AI or pure human teams
7:28
by up to 25%. In 2026, your value won't
7:32
be doing what AI can. I mean, we all
7:34
know that it will be doing what AI
7:36
can't, adding context, making judgment,
7:38
the human side of things, if you will.
7:40
Coming at number eight is hardware
7:42
awareness. AI's next bottleneck isn't
7:44
algorithms, it's compute. The E I always
7:48
have to count how many E spectrum 2025
7:51
chip report highlights that
7:52
understanding GPUs, NPUs, and energy
7:55
efficiency is becoming critical even for
7:57
software developers because when you
7:59
know about hardware limits or what
8:01
accelerates your models, you can design
8:03
smarter, faster, and cheaper solutions.
8:05
I mean, even a basic awareness of chip
8:07
architecture will set you apart. Coming
8:09
in at number nine is product thinking.
8:11
All this technology means nothing if it
8:14
doesn't really solve a real problem. Now
8:16
according to A16Z the state of AI report
8:19
that they produce the startups winning
8:21
right now are not the most advanced they
8:24
are the most user centered product
8:27
thinking is how you connect innovation
8:28
to impact it's not can we build this
8:31
it's should we
8:33
technology changes lives not just
8:35
industries all right coming in at number
8:37
10 the last one save the last one for
8:40
best in my opinion communication and
8:42
storytelling listen to this in my
8:45
opinion this is the most underrated one,
8:46
the underrated skill of all especially
8:48
in tech. So the nationalmies of sciences
8:51
call communication a technical
8:53
competency because the most complex tech
8:55
becomes the most valuable if you are
8:57
able to explain it clearly. I mean think
9:00
about it. If you're able to explain the
9:02
tech behind what's working behind your
9:03
client systems or to your teammates,
9:05
it's huge and you can be a leader for
9:07
that. So what does this all mean for
9:09
you? Well, one, AI will keep evolving
9:11
faster than any of us expect. Some job
9:13
titles will disappear, some new ones
9:15
will appear, and the tools will keep on
9:17
changing. But these 10 skills, systems
9:19
thinking, AI literacy, data engineering,
9:22
and the rest. They're the connective
9:24
tissue, if you will, of the future
9:26
workforce. All right, I hope you enjoyed
9:27
this video and feel inspired about what
9:30
you want to learn next, where you want
9:31
to put your focus for new skills. As a
9:34
reminder, I linked meter down below, so
9:36
go check it out. All right, I need more
9:38
coffee. I don't, but I'm going to go get
9:40
more.
