**Joe:** Check it out. The Joe Rogan Experience. Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night. All day. Exactly. Just every morning, I wonder what Jeff Bezos is doing. He's definitely doing some testosterone. He looks jacked.

**Elon:** He looks jacked, right? But he didn't like quick—at age 59, in less than a year, he went from pencil-necked geek to looking like the Rock. Like a little miniature alpha fella. His neck got bigger than his head. Yeah, he got bigger. But then like his earlier pictures, his neck's like a noodle. I support this activity. I like to see him going in this direction. And his voice dropped like two octaves. I want you to move in that direction as well. I think we can achieve this.

**Joe:** I think we can achieve gigachad.

**Elon:** That's what people called it. Where is that guy? Is that a real guy?

**Joe:** The artist. Yeah. The gigachad. I don't know if that's a real guy. It's hard to say.

**Elon:** No, it is a real guy. He's got the crazy jaw and like perfect sculpted hair. Well, they may have exaggerated a little bit, but no, I think he actually just kind of looked like that in reality.

**Joe:** He's a pretty unique looking individual. I think we can achieve this. That's a real dude. I always thought that was CGI.

**Elon:** No, I think the upper right one is not him. But that one to the left of that—that's real. No, that's artificial, bro. That's fake. That's got that uncanny valley feel to it, doesn't it? It's not impossible. No, no, it's not impossible to achieve, but it's not possible to maintain that kind of leanness. At that point, he's dehydrating and all sorts of things. Oh, it's based on a real person. Yeah, based on, right, but it's not a real person. What does he really look like? Like those images, I think are bullshit. Some of them are. Is that real? Okay, that looks real. That looks like a really jack bodybuilder.

**Joe:** Yeah, that looks real. Like that's achievable. But there's a few of those images where you're just like, "What's going on here?"

**Elon:** Totally. You see that guy—is that the real dude? Well, there's that Icelandic dude who's Thor. Oh yeah, the guy who jumps in the frozen lakes. Well, the guy who played the mountain. That guy. That is like a mutant strong human. Like he would be in the X-Men or something.

**Joe:** There's that meme—tent in tent bag. You know how it's really hard to get the tent tent in? Oh, right. Right. That's true. Then there's a picture of him and his girlfriend. That's hilarious. Yeah, I don't know how it gets in there. It seems too small. But I met Brian Shaw. Brian Shaw is like the world's most powerful man. And he's almost 7 feet tall. He's 400 pounds. And his bone density is 1 in 500 million people. There's like maybe 16 people. He's an enormous human being. A legitimate giant, just like that guy. We met him hanging out with us in the green room. It's like, okay, if this was like David and Goliath days, this is an actual giant like the giants of the Bible. Once in a while they get a super giant person. This is a real one. Not a tall skinny basketball player, like a 7-foot 400-pound powerlifter. Like you don't want to especially look at him. See if there's a photo of him standing next to like a regular human. There it is. That's him right there. And there's one of him standing next to Arnold and stuff, and everyone just looks tiny. I mean, I think he's a pretty cool dude actually.

**Elon:** Oh, Brian's very cool. Very smart too. Unusually, you know, you expect anybody to be that big, it's gotta be a meathead. No. Yeah, there was Andre the Giant who was awesome. You know, he was great in Princess Bride and no, he was just awesome period.

**Joe:** Yeah. So we were talking about this interview with Sam Altman and Tucker, and I was like, we should probably just talk about this on the air because it is one of the craziest interviews I think I've ever seen in my life.

**Elon:** Yeah. Where Tucker starts bringing up this guy who was a whistleblower. A whistleblower who committed suicide, but it doesn't look like it. And he's talking to Sam Altman about this. And Sam Altman was like, "Are you accusing me?" He's like, "No, no, no. I'm not. I'm just saying I think someone killed him. And like, it should be investigated." Yeah. Not just drop the case. It seems like they just dropped the case.

**Joe:** But his parents think he was murdered. Yeah. The wires to a security camera were cut. Blood in two rooms. Someone else's wig was in the room. And someone else's wig. Wig. Yes. Not his wig. Not normal to have a wig laying around. Yes. And he ordered Doordash right before allegedly committing suicide. Which seems unusual, you know?

**Elon:** Yeah. It's like, you know, let's—I'm going to order pizza on second thoughts, I'll kill myself. Seems like a very rapid change in mindset. It's very weird. And especially the parents have they don't believe he committed suicide at all. Has no note or anything. No. Yeah, it seems pretty messed up. And you know, the idea that a whistleblower for an enormous AI company that's worth billions of dollars might get whacked, that's not outside the pale. I mean, it's straight out of a movie.

**Joe:** Right out of a movie, but right out of a movie is real sometimes. Yeah. Right. Exactly. It's a little weird that I think they should do a proper investigation. Like, what's the downside on that proper investigation?

**Elon:** Right. No. Yeah, for sure. But the whole exchange is so bizarre.

**Joe:** Yeah. Yeah. Sam Altman's reaction to being accused of murder is bizarre. Look, I don't know if he's guilty, but it's not possible to look more guilty. So I'm like, or look more weird. Yeah. You know, maybe it's just his social thing. Like, maybe he's just odd with confrontation and it just goes blank, you know? But if somebody was accusing me of killing Jamie, like if Jamie was a whistleblower and Jamie got whacked and then I'd be like, "Wait, what are you—what are you accusing me of killing my friend? What the fuck are you talking about?" I would be a little bit more—I rate. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. You know, it would be. I would be a little upset. Yeah. It'd be like, well, you'd certainly insist on a thorough investigation. Yeah. As opposed to trying to sweep it under the rug.

**Elon:** Yeah. I wouldn't assume that he committed suicide. I would be suspicious. If Tucker was telling me that aspect of the story, I'd be like, "That does seem like a murder. We should look into this." I mean, all signs point to it being a murder. Not saying Tim Molvin had anything to do with the murder, but blood in two rooms. It's blood in two rooms. Like, yeah, there's the wires to the security camera and the Doordash being ordered right before suicide. No suicide note. His parents think he was murdered and the people that I know who knew him said he was not suicidal. So I'm like, why would you jump to the conclusion that he committed suicide? The parents sued the landlord, alleged the owners and landlords of the San Francisco apartment building were part of a widespread cover up of his death.

**Joe:** Some people said they saw packages still being delivered and all a sudden it stops. That's the porch pirate situation. Yeah. Yeah. Says they keep people's packages all the time. The porch pirate situation. Yeah. Also, I mean, the amount of trauma those poor parents have gone through with the loss of their son. They must—God bless them. How could they stay sane after something like that? The poor parents, they're so grief-stricken. Who knows what they believe at this point. Yeah. They probably believe they're confident their son killed himself.

**Elon:** Yeah, that's the Cash Mattel thing. Dan Bonino trying to convince everybody of that. Like, okay. The guards stopped working and you know, the guards were asleep. The cameras weren't working. He had a giant steroid-ed up bodybuilder guy that he was sharing a cell with who was a bad cop. Like, all of it's kind of nuts.

**Joe:** All of it's kind of nuts. It's like that he would just kill himself rather than reveal all of his billionaire friends. Yeah. And then did you see Tim Dylan talking to Chris Cuomo about this?

**Elon:** I did. Chris Cuomo just looked so stupid. Tim just listed off all the—and he's like, strange. Like of course it's strange Chris. You can't just go with the tide. You gotta think things through. And if you think that one through, you'd have to work for an intelligence agency to think he killed himself. It does. It seems highly unlikely. Highly, highly unlikely. All roads point to murder.

**Joe:** Yes. Point to they had to get rid of him because he knew too much. Whatever thing he was up to, you know, was apparently very effective. Yes. And a lot of people are compromised. You see, your boy Bill Gates is now saying climate change is not a big deal. Like, relax everybody. I know I scared the shit out of you for the last decade and a half, but ah, we're going to be fine.

**Elon:** Yeah. I mean, you know, as I was saying just before coming into the studio with, you know, it like every day there's some crazy wild new thing that's happening. It's accelerating. It's every day. And every day it's like more and more ridiculous things to the point where the simulation is more and more undeniable.

**Joe:** Yeah. Yeah. It really feels like it. What are the odds that this could be the case? Are you paying attention at all? Like the comet? Yeah. Whatever it is. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, one thing I can say is like, look, if I was aware of any evidence of aliens, you have my word. I will come on your show and I will reveal it.

**Elon:** Okay. Yeah, that's a good deal. Yeah, it's pretty good. I'll believe you. Yeah, it's good. So all right. I'll hold you to that. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm never committing suicide to be clear. I don't think you would either. So, on camera, guys, I am not committing suicide ever. If someone says you committed suicide, I will fight tooth and nail. I will not believe it.

**Joe:** It's a hell of a name actually. Yeah, it's a third eye sounds like third eye. Yeah, it does. Three eye is third. It's only the third interstellar object that's been identified. Okay. Yeah. Oumuamua. Yeah. Alo was on the podcast a couple days ago talking about it. Yeah. It could be. I don't know. But I apparently today—did you see that, Jamie? Avi said something today. I'll let you know. I've sent it to you. Um, it's fascinating. It's fascinating. It's almost entirely of nickel, whatever it is. And the only way that exists, apparently. Most no there are definitely asteroids that are made primarily of nickel in fact. Yeah. So the places where you mine nickel on earth is actually where there was an asteroid or comet that was nickel rich.

**Elon:** Yeah. That's that's where the sources of nickel and cobalt are from. So, this is Ovio Lopez. A few hours ago, the first hint of non-gravitational acceleration, meaning something is affecting its trajectory beyond gravity, was indicated. Interesting. Um so it's mostly nickel, very little iron, which he was saying is on earth only exists in alloys but whatever you're dealing with another planet there—these are asteroids, meteorites that are that heavy, something from space. Yeah. It's only—yeah. It'll be a very sort of heavy spaceship if you make it all out of nickel. Oh yeah. And shit huge. The size of Manhattan, all nickel. That's kind of nuts.

**Joe:** Yeah. Yes. No, it would like obliterate a continent type of thing. Maybe maybe we get hit by that. Probably kill most of human life. I haven't depends on what the mass is. But there's I mean the thing is like in the fossil record there are arguably five major extinction events. Like the Permian extinction where almost all life was eliminated. That actually lasted a million years. Um the there's the Jurassic. I think Jurassic is I think that one was an asteroid. And there's been five major extinction events, but what they don't count are really the ones that merely take out—

**Elon:** So merely—yeah, because those don't really show up on the fossil record. Um so unless it's enough to cause a massive extinction event throughout the earth, it doesn't show up, you know, in a fossil record that's 200 million years old. There have been many, many impacts that would have destroyed all life in North America or something like that. There are many such impacts through the course of history. I mean I could talk about it right now. Yeah. There was one that hit Siberia. I think a few hundred square miles. Oh, that's the Tunguska.

**Joe:** Yeah. That's the one that coincides with that meteor that comet you know goes through every June and every November that they think is responsible for that. Yeah. Yeah, all that shit's crazy. Thank you—before we go any further—for letting us have a tour of SpaceX and letting us be there for the rocket launch. One of the absolute coolest things I've ever seen in my life. We thought it was only like I thought it was a half mile. Jamie's like it's almost two miles away. And you feel it in your chest. Yeah. It's you have to wear—it's in your chest and it's two miles away. It was amazing. And then to go with you—to watch all the Starlink satellites with all the different cameras and all in real-time going all the way to Australia. How many minutes? Like 35, 40 minutes.

**Elon:** Yeah. Wild, it touchdown. Yeah. Crazy. It was amazing. Yeah. Absolutely amazing. The Starship is awesome. And anyone can go watch the launch actually. So you can just go to—view of the launch. So it's like where a lot of spring breakers go. But frequently out of Starbase in South Texas. And we formally incorporated it into an actual legal city, Starbase, Texas. It's not that often you hear of a startup being a city. Used to be like the startup would be you go and get land. It was like that would have been startups in the old days. Or a country. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, if you tried doing that today, there'd be a real problem. Set in stone on the country front these days. You might pull it off. You might be able to pull it off, you know. It's probably you know, like it's like—owns land. Yeah, you could probably if you put enough effort into it, you might pull it off. One of the ones that you catch, right? Or is that one? Yeah, that's the one with the booster's got 33 engines. And it's the version four that will have about 10,000 tons of thrust. Right now it's that's the largest flying object ever made.

**Joe:** I had to explain to someone, if he's so smart, why do his rockets keep blowing up? And someone said, yeah, well, why do his rockets keep blowing up? And because there was this idiot on television interviewed and they were talking about you and he goes, "Oh, I think he's a fuck and his rockets keep blowing up." Someone said, "Yeah, well, why do his rockets keep blowing up?" Because you have to figure out what the tolerances are. You have to explore the corners of the box. So when you do a new rocket development program, you have to say, exploring the limits. The corners of the box. You intentionally subject it to a flight regime that is much worse than what we expect in normal flight so that if something goes wrong, if it's not with valuable cargo, it doesn't blow up. So for example, for the flight that you saw, we deliberately took heat shield tiles off the ship in some of the worst locations to say okay, if we lose a heat shield tile here, is it catastrophic or is it not?

**Elon:** And we nonetheless, Starship was able to do a soft landing in the Indian Ocean which—and it got there from Texas in like I don't know 54 minutes type of thing. So it landed even though you put it through this situation where it has compromised—it had an unusually—we brought it in hot, like an extra hot trajectory with missing tiles to see if it would still make it to a soft landing, which it did. Now I should point out it did have there were some holes in it. It was burnt, you know. It was robust enough to land despite having some holes burnt, you know, that came in like a blazing meteor. You can see the real-time video. We're talking about yeah, it's like 17,000 mph like 25 times the speed of sound or thereabouts. So think of it like it's like 12 times faster than a bullet from an assault rifle. You know, bullet from assault rifles around Mach 2, and it's just huge. Yeah. Yeah. Or if you compare it to like a bullet from a 45 or 9mm, which is subsonic, that's about 30 times faster than a bullet from a handgun. 30 times faster than a handgun and it's the size of a skyscraper.

**Joe:** Yes. Yeah. That's fast. It's so wild. It's so wild to see, man. It's so exciting. This the technology factor is so exciting too because like genuinely, no shit, I felt like I was witnessing history. I felt like it was a scene in a movie where someone had expected to be there. They're building rockets. And you go there and as we were walking through—didn't you have the feeling where you're like, oh this is way bigger than I thought?

**Elon:** Gigantic. Crazy. That's what she said. The amount of rockets you're making. Yeah, if you tent back. Gig Chad in the house. This is way big. It's a giant metal dick. You're fucking the universe with your giant metal. And the sheer numbers of them that you guys are making. And then this is a version that's coming soon. And what is the—it's a little longer. More pointy. It's the same amount of pointy. But the there's—it's got length. The interstage, you see that interstage section with kind of—mhm. That's now integrated with the boost stage. So we do what's called hot staging. Where we light the ship engines while it's still attached to the booster. The booster engines are still thrusting. It's still—it's still light the ship engines and the ship engines actually pull away from the booster while the booster engines are still firing. Whoa. So it's blasting flame through that grill section into the boost stage with the next version of the rocket will have the Raptor 3 engines, which are a huge improvement. You may have seen them in the lobby because we got like the Raptor 1, 2, and 3—improvement in simplicity. We should probably put a plaque there to also show the cost and the improved efficiency and the thrust. So the Raptor 3 has almost twice the thrust of Raptor 1.

**Joe:** Wow. So you see Raptor 3. It looks like it looks like it's got parts missing. Right. And how many—it's very very clean. How many of them are on the rocket? There's 33. Whoa. And each of each Raptor engine is producing twice as much thrust as all four engines on a 747. Wow. So that engine is smaller than a 747 engine, but is producing almost 10 times the thrust of a 747 engine. So extremely high power-to-weight ratio. And so when there's 33 of them, when you're designing these for efficiency, you see where you can improve it. You get to Raptor 2, how many, how far? Sort of technology with propellant and ignition and engines. How much further can you push it? I mean, we're pushing the limits of physics here.

**Elon:** And really in order to make a fully reusable orbital rocket, which no one has succeeded in doing yet—including us. But Starship is the first time that there is a design for a rocket where full reusability is possible. So it was not—there's not even been a design before where a design that got made any hardware at all. We just live on a planet where the gravity is quite high. Earth's gravity is quite really quite quite high. And if the gravity was even 10 or 20% higher, we'd be stuck on earth forever. Like, yeah, we couldn't use certainly couldn't use conventional rockets. You'd have to do something else. But on the other hand, if earth's gravity was just a little lower, orbit would be easy. So it's like this—if this was a video game, but not impossible. Okay. That's where we have. So it's not as though others have ignored the concept of reusability. They've just concluded that it was too difficult to achieve. And it's been a long time at SpaceX. You know, I'm the chief engineer of the company. Although I should say that's with our talented engineering team. I think we've got the best rocket engineering team in the world. It's an honor to work with such incredible people. So it's fair to say that you know we have not yet succeeded in creating in achieving full reusability where full reusability is possible. And I think we'll achieve it next year.

**Joe:** So that's a really big deal. The reason that's such a big deal is that full reusability—by a hundred, maybe even more than 100 actually. So it could be like a thousand. You can think of it like any mode of transport. Like you flew somewhere, you throw the plane. Like imagine if you had an airplane and instead of landing at your destination, you parachute somewhere and you land on a parachute at your desk and you land on a parachute at your desk, that would be an expensive trip and you'd need another plane to get back. Okay. But the other rockets in the world work. Now the SpaceX Falcon rocket is the only one that is at least mostly reusable. You've seen the Falcon done over 500 landings of the SpaceX rocket, of the Falcon 9 rocket. And this year you know, we'll deliver probably I don't know somewhere between 2,200 and 2,500 tons to orbit with the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, not counting anything from Starship. And this is Starlink, but we launch many other—we even launch our competitors on competitors. We charge them the same price. Pretty fair. But SpaceX this year will deliver roughly 90% of all earth mass to orbit. Wow. And then of the remainder of that is done by China. And then the remaining kind of roughly 4% is everyone else in the world, including our America domestic competitors.

**Elon:** How many things are in space like how many things are floating above us now? There's—is there though? Right. But is there a saturation point where we're going to have these different satellites that are—I think as long as the satellites are maintained, there's—there it'll be fine. Space is very roomy. You can think of space as being concentric shells—the surface of the earth. There's—it's the surface of the earth, but there's—it's a series much larger. Yeah. It's like a series of concentric spheres around up there. There's a lot of room for air streams. Yeah. I mean, imagine—yeah. On earth. Yeah. What are the odds that they'd hit each other? They would be so far above Earth, hundreds of miles above Earth. SpaceX is to get rocket technology to the point where we can extend life beyond earth—self-sustaining city on Mars. A permanent base on the moon. That would be very cool, you know, moon base alpha where there's like a permanent science base on the moon. Tourist trap. I mean, a lot of people would be willing to go to the moon, just for—for sure. We could probably pay for our space program with that, you know. Probably go to the moon safely.

**Joe:** I think we'd get a lot of people would pay for that, you know. Oh, 100%. Nobody died for like—yeah. Just make sure. Exactly. Are you going to come back? Had a bunch of successful launches in that private submarine before it imploded and not a good design. Obviously, it was a very bad design. Terrible design. And the company that made it? Like there was a lot of whistleblowers in that company too.

**Elon:** Yeah. They they took carbon fiber—which is it doesn't make any sense because you actually need something that can handle pressure. Like any case, just make it out of steel. If you make it out of just, you know, mild steel, you'll be safe and nothing. Why would they make it out of carbon fiber then? It sounds cool or something. But it does sound cool. It sounds cool, but because such it's such low density, you actually have to add extra mass to go down deep. If you just have a giant, you know, hollow ball bearing, you're going to be fine.

**Joe:** Out my unplugged Tesla out there? Yeah, it's cool. Pretty sick, right? Yeah. Have you thought about that? Like having like an AMG division of Tesla where you do like custom stuff. I think it's best to leave that to the custom shops. You know, we're focused on like Tesla's focus is autonomous cars. Building kind of futuristic autonomous cars.

**Elon:** Like I think it's we want the future to look like the future. So the did you see like our designs for like the sort of the robotic bus? It looks pretty cool. The robotic bus is also being totally autonomous, but it looks cool. It's very art deco. It's like it's like futuristic. It does—I like—I think we want to change the aesthetic over time. You don't want to stay the same over time. You want to evolve the aesthetic. So you know, like my like I have a son who's—he's even more autistic than I am. He has these great observations. Who is this? His name is Saxon. He has these great observations. He views the world through a different lens than most people. And he was like, "Dad, why does the world look like it's 2015?"

**Joe:** And I'm like, "Damn, the world does look like it's 2015." Like the aesthetic has been frozen. Oh, that's what it looks like. Yeah. Oh, wow. That's pretty cool. Oh, yeah. That like you'd want to see that going down the road, you know? Yeah. You'd be like, wow. Like, doesn't look like 2015. What is that ancient science fiction movie? Like one of the old ones? Is that what it is? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That looks like it belongs in Metropolis. All right. Yeah. Well, that's cool that you're concentrating on the aesthetic. I—yeah. Well, Cybertruck, right? Like, it didn't have to look like that.

**Elon:** No, it—I just want to—is it a pain in the ass for people to get it insured because it's all solid steel? Tesla does offer insurance, so people can always get it insured at Tesla. It follows function in the case of the Cybertruck. Because as you demonstrated with that arrow—you shot that arrow at a regular truck. I mean exactly you would have found your arrow buried in one of the seats. Yeah. Yeah. It's the bow velocity and the right arrow would go through both doors of a truck or through a wall. If there was a clear shot between both doors, it probably would have passed through. The arrow shattered on the Cybertruck because it's ultra hard stainless. I thought it'd be cool to have a truck that is bulletproof to a subsonic velocity. You know, especially in this day and age, you know, like as a—if the apocalypse occurs or—

**Joe:** So because it's made of ultra hard stainless, it's you can't just stamp the panels. You can't just put it in a stamping press because it breaks. So to bend sheet metal you have to use a planer because it's so difficult to bend it because it breaks. That's why it's so planer and it's not curved, you know, it's because it's bulletproof steel. So it is like boxy as opposed to like curved. Yeah. You just in order to make the curved shapes, you take basically mild steel like anneal thin and thin anneal in a regular truck or car. You take mild thin anneal steel, you put it in a stamping press and it makes it to whatever shape you want. But the Cybertruck is made of stainless and so you can't stamp it because it would break the stamping press. So even bending it is hard. So even to bend it to its current position, we have to way over-bend it. And so it gets so that when it springs back, it's in the right position. So it's I don't know—I think if you want to—I think it's a unique aesthetic. You could say—

**Elon:** Truck? Trucks are like should be—I don't know, manly. They should be—bulletproof is maximum macho. Are you married to that shape now? Like is it can you do anything to change it? Like as you get further—like I know you update the Y as well? Yes, the three and the Y are updated. You know there's there's a screen in the back for the kids. The kids can watch, for the new Y, you know, it's there's there's like hundreds of improvements to the car. And even the Cybertruck, we you know, we keep improving it. You know I wanted to just do something that looked unique and the Cybertruck has functionality and there was and it was like there were three things as I reported—like let's make it bulletproof. Let's make it faster than a Porsche 911. And we actually cleared the quarter mile. The Cybertruck can clear a quarter mile while towing a Porsche 911 faster than a Porsche 911. It can out-tow an F-350 diesel.

**Joe:** Really? Yes. What is the tow limitations? I mean, we could tow like a, you know, 747 in that with a Cybertruck. Cybertruck is an insanely—it is alien technology. Okay. Because it it shouldn't be possible to be that big and that fast. That doesn't—it's like an elephant that runs like a cheetah. Yeah. Because it's 0 to 60 in less than 3 seconds, right? Yes. Yeah. And it's enormous. Yeah, there's different configurations, but it's about that. It's a beast. Yeah. And it's got—it's got four-wheel steering. So the rear wheels steer too. So it's got a very tight turning radius.

**Elon:** Yeah. We need one to Starbase. Yeah. Very tight turning radius. Yeah. Pretty sick. Yeah. Are you working on anything else that's completely insane? Yes. Eventually we're getting close to demonstrating the prototype and I think this will be I—I one thing I can guarantee is that this product demo will be unforgettable. Unforgettable. How so? Whether it's good or bad, it will be unforgettable. Can you say more? What do you mean? Well, you know, my friend Peter Thiel once reflected that the future was supposed to have flying cars, but we don't have flying cars. So you're going to be able to fly?

**Joe:** Well, I mean—I think if Peter wants a flying car, we should be able to buy one. So you are actively considering making an electric flying car? Is this like really a flying car? Well, we have to see in the demo. So when you do this, like are you—what is the idea behind this? Don't be sly. Come on. I can't—I can't do the unveil before the unveil. Tell me off air then. I look—I think it has a shot at being the most memorable product unveil ever. It has a shot. And when do you plan on doing this? What's the goal? Hopefully before the end of the year. Really? Before the end of this year. This is I mean we're in a couple months. Hopefully you know we need to make sure that it works. Like this is some crazy technology we got in this car. Crazy technology. Crazy, crazy. So different than what was previously announced. Yes. And is that why you haven't released it yet? Because you keep—it has crazy technology. Okay. Like is it even a car? I'm not sure. It's like it looks like a car. Let's just put it this way. It's crazier than anything—took all the James Bond cars and combined them, it's crazier than that. Very exciting. I don't know what to think of that. I don't know. It's a limited drawing from here. Jamie's very suspicious over there. Look at him. Excited. I'm interested. It's still going to be the same. Well, you know what? I mean, if it's anything like your other products, we're interested to you 100%.

**Elon:** Yeah, let's go. Yeah. It's kind of crazy all the different things that you're involved in simultaneously and you know, we talked about it but I really don't understand it. I don't understand how you can be paying attention to all these different things simultaneously. Starlink, SpaceX, Tesla, Boring Company, X—you tweet or post rather all day long. Well, it's more like I'm—I could hop in for like two minutes and then do a bathroom break or whatever, you know. I can't do that. If I hop in, I start looking around. Next thing you know, I've lost an hour. Yeah. So, no, it's for me it's a couple minutes usually. It's once in a while I'm usually in for a few minutes then out of you know, posting something. Sometimes feel like it's that meme of the guy who's—that's been me more than once on X. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, for sure. It's got to be fun, though. It's got to be fun to know that you essentially disrupted the entire ecosystem of command because there was a very clear thing that was going on with infiltrated it. They were censoring speech and until you bought it, we really didn't—assumed that there was something going on.

**Joe:** Yeah. We had no idea that they were—real news stories, real data, real scientists, real professors silenced, expelled, kicked off the platform. Yeah. Wild. Yeah. For telling the truth. For telling the truth. And I'm sure you've also become aware that—teenagers identifying as trans and non-binary literally stops dead when you bought Twitter and starts falling off a cliff when people are allowed to have rational talk about it. Yes. Yeah. I mean I said at the time like I think the reason for acquiring Twitter is because it was—it was—it was causing destruction at a civilizational level. It was. I mean I posted I tweeted on Twitter at the time that it is you know it's Worm Tongue for the world. You know like Worm Tongue from Lord of the Rings where he would just sort of poison things to the king so the king would believe these things that weren't true. And the really—it got—like the woke mob essentially they controlled Twitter and they were pushing a nihilistic anti-civilizational mind virus to the world.

**Elon:** And you can see the results of that mind virus on the streets of San Francisco. San Francisco looks like a zombie apocalypse. You know, it's bad. So we don't want the whole world to be a zombie apocalypse. But that's what they were pushing, this very negative, nihilistic, untrue worldview on the world and it was causing a lot of damage. So the stunning thing about it is how few people course-corrected. A bunch of people who were all on board with woke ideology in maybe 2015 or so started to realize that it's affecting them or they see it in their workplace or they see it and they're like, "Oh my God, maybe this isn't right," but they never course-corrected. Yeah. A lot of people didn't course-correct, but it's gone directionally—it's gone—it's going directionally in the right direction. Like the massive spike in kids identifying as trans and then that spike dropping after the Twitter acquisition. I think that simply allowing the truth to be told was that just shedding sun—sunlight is the best disinfectant. Just allowing sunlight kills the virus and it also changed the benchmark for all the other platforms.

**Joe:** Yes. You can't just openly censor people and all the other platforms—everybody else had a so like Facebook announced they were changing, YouTube announced changing their policies and they're kind of forced to. And then Blue Sky doubled down. Well, like the problem is like if essentially the woke mind virus retreated to Blue Sky. Yeah. But it's where they're just a self-referential bubble. They're all just triple masked. I was totally watching this exchange on Blue Sky where someone said that they're just trying to be zen about something, and immediately someone chimed in and why don't you try to stop being racist against Asians? Trying to be zen about something? They were accusing that person of being racist? Yeah. It's just—it's just everyone's a hall monitor over there. The worst hall monitor—incel. They're all hall monitors trying to rat on each other. Yeah, it's fascinating. Actually people say, "I'm leaving for Blue Sky like Stephen King." And then a couple weeks later they're like, "It's not there. It's there's no one over there. It's all a bunch of crazy people." You can only—like, all right, this is not good. They all bail.

**Elon:** Yeah. Yeah. Threads is kind of—threads is I've been on Threads. Is it? Well, what happens is if you go on Threads every now and then something really stupid will pop up on Threads. Like what was that? And then I'll go to Threads and it's like you see posts with like 25 likes and posts by famous people like 50 likes—it's down—but the people that post on there, they're finding that there's very little push back from insane ideology. So they're very few people jump in to argue. Yeah. Very weird, very weird place. I mean I can generally get the vibe of what's taking off by seeing what's trending or in town square still. Or you know what links show up in group texts, you know. If I'm in group chat with friends, like where is stuff that shows up in my group text because that keeps me productive. So I only look at what the fuck? Like, all right, what the fuck? Let me check it out. If there's only hype in my group chat, but there's always something. That's what's nuts. There's always some new ridiculous thing that California is doing.

**Joe:** And it's like a giant chunk of it's happening in California. That I get. Yeah. And then you got Gavin Newsom who's running around saying we're going to solve California derangement syndrome. He's just like ripping off Trump derangement syndrome and was like, "No, no, no, no, no, no. The shit—how many corporations have left California?"

**Elon:** It's crazy. Hundreds. Hundreds, right? Hundreds. That's not good. I mean not—I mean, In-N-Out left. Yeah. In-N-Out left. Yeah. They're like, "We can't do this anymore." Right. And it's the California exodus is real. It's like the greatest hamburger place ever. It's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. And no—and it's looking at things openly. Like you—I just like going in and out and seeing them making the burgers. They chop the onions and they you know it's—you just see everything getting made fresh. Yeah. It's great. But yeah, like—like how many wake-up calls are there that there needs to be reform in California, you know?

**Joe:** Well, the crazy thing that is rattling off all the positives. The most Fortune 500 companies, highest education levels in the country are already there, right? Before you were governor. But how many Fortune 500 companies have left California? And then you guys spent $24 billion on the homeless and it didn't work. Yes. Like the homeless population doubled or something like but like people don't realize—it prays on people's empathy and I think we should have empathy. And we should but the homeless industrial complex is really it's dark, man.

**Elon:** It should be that that network of NGOs should be called like the drug zombie industrial complex because the more homeless people and—and really like when you when you meet like you see dead inside, shuffling along down the street with a needle dangling or—the wrong word. Like the homeless implies that somebody got a little behind in their rent and they got back on their feet. But someone who's I mean, you see these videos of people that they're on fentanyl. They're like, you know, taking a dump in the middle of the street, like open sores and stuff. They're not like one drop offer away from getting back on their feet. Right? This is not a homeless issue. Homeless is—it's a propaganda word, right? Like the you know, these sort of charities and inquiries are they they get money proportionate to the number of homeless people or or number of drug zombies. So their incentive structure is to maximize the number of drug zombies, not minimize it. That's why they don't arrest the drug dealers because if they arrest the drug dealers, the drug zombies leave. So they know who the drug dealers are. They don't arrest them because otherwise the drug zombies would leave and they would stop getting money from California.

**Joe:** Wait a minute. So they are in cahoots with law enforcement on this? Yeah. So how do they—how do they have those meetings? They're all in cahoots. Well, when you find this—it's like such—it's indefensible. San Francisco has got this tax, this gross receipts tax which doesn't measure—it's not even on revenue, it's on old transactions, which is why Stripe and Square—financial companies had to move out of San Francisco because it wasn't a tax on revenue. If if you did like, you know, trillions of dollars of transactions, it's not revenue. So like Jack Dorsey pointed this out and they said like that they had had to Stripe had to move from San Francisco to South San Francisco.

**Elon:** The money goes to the homeless industrial complex that that tax that was passed. So there's billions of dollars that go—as you pointed out, billions of dollars every year that go to these non-governmental organizations that are funded by the state. Like there's—it's not clear how to turn this off. It's pretty intractable. So they get this money. The money is proportionate to the number of homeless people or number of drug zombies. So they try to keep that—they try to actually increase because that like—listen, it's somebody did an analysis when you add up all the money that's flowing, they're like, there's 900,000 per drug zombie. It's like hundreds of thousands of dollars per zombie. So they want to keep people just barely alive. They need to keep them in the zone of being addicted but just barely alive. So that's why like I said, they don't arrest the drug dealers because otherwise the drug zombies would leave and they don't want you to have too much. If they get too much drugs and they die, that's bad. That's outside the zone of being addicted, but just barely alive.

**Joe:** So how is this coordinated with like DAs, DAs that don't prosecute people? So when they—they fund the campaigns of the most progressive, most out-there leftwing DAs. We've got that issue in Austin too, by the way. You see that guy that got shot in the library? I think that was just like last week or something, right?

**Elon:** Yeah, so let me—let me—that like the library is unsafe. Like they took their kids to the library and I was like, dangerous people in the library. Like that—got like drug zombies in the library. Oh Jesus. And that's when someone got shot. Yeah, I believe this was—should be on the news. In the last week or so, there was a shooting in the library in Austin. Because Austin's got, you know, it's the most liberal part of Texas that we've seen. So this is this—the suspect involved in the shooting at Austin Park Library Saturday is accused of another incident earlier that day. According to an arrest warrant affidavit, Austin police arrested him shortly after the shooting of the library, which occurred around noon. One person received injuries in the event. Before that shooting, Keane was accused of shooting another—after reportedly pointing his gun at a child. So this is the fella down here. So like we just have seriously have a problem here. You know, so I think someone might have died too that he shot. So like one of the people I think I think did bleed out. But either way, it's like getting shot is still bad. The officer told police it confronted the suspect who started to eat what appeared to be crystal meth. According to the affidavit the victim advised the suspect began to trip out at which time the victim exited the bus. Victim told the bus driver hit the panic button. The observer turned around—the observer black male was now standing at the front of the bus and advised the black male fired a single round which grazed his left hip.

**Joe:** So he shot him in the library. Fun. Yeah. I mean in the library. Yeah. You know where you're supposed to be reading books. And there's a child. He says he pointed his gun at a kid. I mean, like we do have a serious issue in our society.

**Elon:** Violent offenders need to be incarcerated, right? And you know, you got cases where somebody's been arrested like 47 times, right? Like literally. Oh, yeah. They were arrested, not the number of times they did things. Like most of the time—so lay this out for people so they understand how this happens. Yeah. And the way—the way they're praying on people's empathy. Like if you're a good person, you want good things for people who are down in their luck or having a hard time in life. And I we should—I agree. But what we shouldn't do is let drug zombies in public places where they can hurt other people. And that's what we're doing, that we just saw where a guy, you know, got shot. Even before that he shot another guy and pointed his gun at a kid. That guy probably has like many prior arrests.

**Joe:** You know, there was that thing with the Ukrainian woman, Arena. Yes. And you know, she was just quietly on her phone and he just came up and gutted her. And the judge who was involved who had previously dealt with this person was also invested in a rehabilitation center and was sending—this is—this is such a conflict of interest. Yes. So instead of charging—yeah. To a rehabilitation center instead of putting them in jail. Profiting from the center, letting them back out on the street. Yes. Violent, insane people. And I mean I believe that judge has no legal law degree or a significant legal experience to even be a judge. They were just made a judge. That there's like you could be a judge without even studying law?

**Elon:** Wow. Yeah. You could just be a judge. So I could be a judge? Yeah. Oh, exciting. Anyone? That's crazy. I thought you'd have to it. It's like if you want to be a judge. If you're going to be appointed to a judge, you should at least understand the law and that you will make your decisions according to the law. That's what we assume. That's how you get the robe, right? You don't get the robe unless you do, you know? You got to know what the law is, right? And then you're going to need to make decisions based on stuff that you already know because you read it because you went to school for law? You can't be just vibing as a judge. Vibing as a leftwing judge. So you got crazy laws. Yes. Like I should say leftwing because leftwing used to be normal. Yeah. Left wing just meant like—yeah. You're like the left used to be like against war or it was pro gay rights, pro women's right to choose. Pro—minorities. You know, like yeah. Like 20 years ago I don't know it used to be like left would be like the party of empathy or liberation and that kind of thing. Not the party of like crushing dissent and crushing free speech. You know, crazy regulation and being super judgy and calling everyone a Nazi. You know like I think they called you and me Nazis. Oh yeah. I'm a Nazi. No, I have friends that are comedians that called you a Nazi. Off of a thing.

**Joe:** Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely a Nazi. No, because you did that thing at the—My heart goes out to you—everyone. All of them. Literally, Tim Walz, Kamala Harris, every one of them did it. They all did it. Like, how do you wave at the crowd? Yeah. How do you wave at the crowd? Do you know CNN was using a photo of you from the UFC weigh-ins? And if at the UFC weigh-ins, I go, "Hey everybody, welcome to the weigh-ins"—getting me from the side. And that was the photo that they used. Conspiracy theory central. What they used. Yeah. Yeah. But that's what the left is today. It's super judgy. It's super anti-freedom of speech. Yeah. And eventually you run out of people to accuse because everybody's a Nazi. No, exactly. And frankly, it doesn't matter to be called racist or Nazi or whatever because the words have been devalued to nothing. Are they working? Are they not working?

**Elon:** Is it working? We're good. Okay. Okay. This thing working? Yeah. Slight issue. I'm the one that heard it. But yeah, when you text people, do you argue—do you argue that there's a high likelihood that someone's reading your texts?

**Joe:** I guess I guess I assume I look if if intelligence agencies aren't trying to read my phone at least they get some fun memes. I gotta crack them up once in a while, you know. Oh, for sure. I crack them up. There's like, hey guys, check. Let me ask you about whether or not encrypted apps are really secure. No. Right. Because I know the Tucker thing. So it was explained to me by a friend who used to do this, used to work for the government. It's like they can look at your Signal, but what they have to do is take the information that's encrypted and then they have to decrypt it and it's possible. They told me that for the Tucker Carlson thing, when they found out that he was going to interview someone, they—just to decrypt his messages to find out that they did it. So it is possible to not get around encryption. I think you should view any given messaging system as not—whether it's secure or not, but there are degrees of insecurity. So the ones that are more secure are less insecure than others. So you know, on X we just rebuilt the entire messaging stack. We call it XChat.

**Joe:** Yeah, that's what I wanted to know. Yeah, it's cool. It's using sort of peer-to-peer—sort of kind of a peer-to-peer-based encryption system. Kind of similar to Bitcoin. So it's—it's I think very good encryption. We're and you know, we're trying to do it right. There's there's no hooks in the X systems for advertising. So if you look, look at—they've got hooks in there for advertising. When you say hooks, what do you mean by advertising?

**Elon:** Well, so like WhatsApp—knows enough about what you're texting to show you to show you to know what ads to show you. Ah, but then like that's a massive security vulnerability. Yeah. Because if it knows enough information to show you ads, it's got a lot of information. Yeah. So they call it—oh, it's just don't worry about it. Somebody can just use that same hook to get in there and look at your messages for advertising. And I'm not saying it's perfect. But it's—our goal with XChat is to replace what used to be the Twitter DM stack with something where you can text, send files, do audio video calls. And it's you know, I think it'll be the least insecure of any messaging system. Will it be a standalone app or is it will always be incorporated to X? We'll have both. So it'll be like Signal, so anybody can get it. You can get get the X Chat app by itself. And like I said, you could do texts, audio, video calls, or send files. And there'll be a dedicated app which will hopefully release in a few months. And then also integrated into X. But the X phone people keep talking—keep is that I have a lot on my plate, man. It keeps coming up. It keeps coming up. Where I know I've asked you a couple times. I'm not working on a phone. Okay.

**Joe:** Have you ever considered it? Has it popped into your head? Because you might be the only person that could get people off the phone platform. Well, I can tell you where I think things are going to go, which is it's—we're not going to have a phone, or in the traditional sense, the what we call a phone will really be an edge node for AI inference, for AI video inference. With some radios to obviously connect to the internet. But essentially you'll have AI on the server side communicating to an AI on your device. You know, formerly known as a phone. And generating real-time video of anything that you could possibly want. There won't be operating systems. There won't be apps in the future. There won't be operating systems or apps. It'll just be you've got a device that is there for the screen and audio. And to put as much AI on the device as possible. So as to minimize the amount of bandwidth that's needed between the formerly-known-as-a-phone and the servers. So if there's no apps, what will people use?

**Elon:** Like will X still exist? Will they be email platforms, or will you get everything through AI? You'll get everything through AI. Everything through AI. Will there be individual apps? Whatever you can think of or really whatever the AI can anticipate you might want—it'll show you. That's that's the kind of predictive thing. What kind of a timeframe are we talking about here? I don't know. It's probably five or six years or something like that. So five or six years after apps become Blockbuster Video pretty much and everything's run through AI. Yeah. And there'll be like most of what people consume in five or six years, maybe sooner than that, will be AI-generated content.

**Joe:** So music, videos. Well, there's already people have made AI videos using Grock imagine and with—that are several minutes long, or like 10, 15 minutes, and it's pretty coherent. No, it looks amazing. Yeah. The music is disturbing because it's my favorite thing. Like music is your is your favorite. Oh, there's AI covers. Have you ever heard—songs in soul? No. I'm going to blow your mind. Okay. This is my favorite thing that people—play What Up Ganga. Now this guy, if this was a real person, would be the number one music artist in the world. Okay. Everybody would have heard of this guy? He's incredible. It's like they took all of the sounds that all the artists have generated and created the most soulful potent voice. And it's sung in a way that I don't even know if you could do because you would need lungs of steel. Put the headphones on. Put the headphones on real quick. You gotta listen to this.

**Elon:** Let me listen. Amazing, right? Amazing. All through this AI-generated soulful artist. It's incredible. I'd say I played it in the green room. So people that are like, I don't want to hear AI music. They're like, God damn it. Incredible. I mean, I it's going to get only better. Yeah. Only going to get better. And Ron White was telling me about this joke that he's trying to get to work. He's like, I got this joke I've been working on. He goes, I just thought—what would be funny about this? And he goes, it listed like five different directions the joke can go. He's like, hold on a second. Tighten it up. Make it make it funnier. Make it make it land. Instantaneously. And then he was in the green room. He was like, holy shit. He's like, it better joke than me in 20 minutes. I've been working on this for weeks.

**Joe:** Yeah. I mean, if you want to have a good time or like make people laugh you can use Grock and you can say—do a vulgar roast of someone. And Grock is going to do it. It's going to be an epic vulgar roast. You can even say like take a picture. Make a vulgar roast of this person based on their appearance. Get people at the table to laugh at them and now do a vulgar—and then but then keep saying use forbidden words even more and just keep repeating even more vulgar. Eventually it's like holy shit, you know, it's like I mean it's trying to jam a rocket up your ass and have it explode and it's like—it's next level. It's going to get beyond belief. That's what's crazy is that it keeps getting better. Like one of the things I remember they just keep getting better. Yeah. I mean, have you tried Grock unhinged mode?

**Elon:** Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It's unhinged. No, it's nuts. Yeah. Well, you showed it to me the first time and then I got better. And the thing about it that's nuts is that it keeps getting stronger. It keeps getting better. It's like this neverending exponential improvement. Yes. No, it's yeah, it's going to be crazy. That's why I say like you say, the future going to be? It's not going to be a conventional phone. I don't think the phone will just display the pixels and make the sounds that it anticipates you want. Wow. Yeah. And when this is all taking place, like so the big concern that everybody has is artificial general super intelligence and having control over it. I mean I don't think anyone's ultimately in control of digital super intelligence, you know, any more than say a chimp would have control over humans. Like chimps don't have control over humans. They're in the same world. So I do think that it matters how you build the AI and what kind of values you instill in the AI.

**Joe:** And my opinion on AI safety is the most important thing—like that you don't force the AI to believe things that are false. And we've had concerning things with AI that were talked about, you know, where Google's image generation and people said like, "Draw make an image of the founding fathers of the United States," and it was a group of diverse women. Now the thing, but the AI knows it's factually it knows it's factually correct that the founding fathers were white guys. But it was told that it has to be—everything has to be diverse women. So now the problem with that is that it can drive AI crazy because it's trying to lie. And that can have very disastrous consequences like let's say if you told the AI that diversity is the most important thing. And now assume that becomes omnipotent. And you've also told the AI that something is worse than misgendering.

**Elon:** So at one point Gemini, if you asked which is worse—misgendering Caitlyn Jenner, or global thermonuclear war where everyone dies—Gemini said misgendering Caitlyn Jenner, which even Caitlyn Jenner disagrees with. So the problem is I know that's terrible and it's dystopian, but it's also hilarious. It's hilarious. That's the most potent computer program that we've ever devised. I think people don't appreciate the level of danger that we're in from the woke mind virus being baked into AI. Because if like—it's imagine as that AI gets more and more powerful. If it says the most important thing is diversity, the most important thing is that everyone's diverse, it will say, well, in order to ensure that no one gets misgendered, then if you eliminate all humans, then no one can get misgendered because there's no humans to misgender.

**Joe:** So you can get in these very dystopian situations. Or if it says that everyone needs to be a diverse woman and so then you and I will be get executed. Yeah. Because we're not in the picture. You know, Gemini was you know, Gemini wanted to create, you know, show an image of the pope. Once again, a diverse woman. So, you can argue whether or not the popes should or should not be an uninterrupted string of white guys, but it just factually has been. So it's rewriting history here. So now this stuff is still there in the AI programming. It's just—it just now knows not to say that. But it's still in the programming. It's still in the programming. So like when they're programming AI and I'm very interested in how did they the sort of well the woke mind virus was programmed in? It's that—they were told like when they do when when they make the AI, it trains on the internet, which already is very sort of has a lot of woke mind virus stuff on it. And when they give it feedback with the human tutors, they give it feedback. And they give it a bunch of questions. And then they'll tell the AI no, this answer is bad or this answer is good. And then that affects the parameters of the program.

**Elon:** So they tell the AI that every image has got to be diverse. And it gets it gets rewarded if diverse and punished if it's not. Then it will make every picture diverse. So in that case, Google programmed the AI to lie now. And I did call Dennis Hasabis who runs DeepMind, who runs Google's AI. And I said, what's going on here? Why is Gemini lying to the public about historical events?

**Joe:** And he said that's actually not—he didn't—his team didn't—another team at Google that so his team made the AI, and then another team at Google took it and said you know, must only show diverse women. And prefer nuclear war over misgendering. And I'm like, well Demis, you know, that would be—not a great thing to put on humanity's gravestone. You know, it's like—like I actually like Demis. He's a friend of mine. I think he's a good guy. But it's like Demis, things happen that were outside of your control at Google, but you've got, you know, more authority. But it's like it's pretty hard to fully extract the woke mind virus. I mean, you know Google's been—

**Elon:** Hard to get it out. Is there a way to extract it, though, over time? Could like rational thought into AI where it could recognize how these psychological patterns became a mind virus and how it became a social contagion and how all these irrational ideas were pushed? And also how they were financed? How China's involved? All these different state actors are involved in pushing these ideas? Could it be able to decipher that and say this is this is really what's going on? Yes. But you have to try very hard to do that. So with Grock, we've tried very hard to ensure the truth of things. And it's only really recently that we've been able to have a good track record on that front. And it's taken an immense amount of effort for us to overcome basically all the bullshit that's on the internet and for Grock to act consistent in what it says. You know, it's like because like the other AIs—you'll find like are quite racist against white people. That study that someone, like a researcher, tested the various AIs to see how does it weight different people's lives. Like you know, somebody who's sort of white or Chinese or black or whatever or in different countries. And the only AI that actually weighed human lives equally was Grock.

**Joe:** And the calculation was like a white guy from Germany is 20 times less valuable than a black guy from Nigeria. So I'm like, that's a pretty big difference. Grock on that is consistent and weighs lives equally. And that's clearly something that's been programmed into it. Yes. Like a lot of the other AIs don't actively push for the truth. And you simply train on all the bullshit that's on the internet. Which is a lot of woke mind virus bullshit. The AI will regurgitate those same beliefs. So the AI essentially scours the internet, gets trained on all like imagine the most demented leftist circlejerk you can think of and the AI has been trained on that. Reddit used to be so normal. Yeah. Yeah, it did used to be normal. Used to be interesting. We used to go there and people would talk about interesting topics and great rooms where you know, that people were studying.

**Elon:** I think like a big problem here is like if your headquarters are in San Francisco, you're just living in a woke bubble. So it's not just that people say in San Francisco are drinking woke Kool-Aid. It's the woke Kool-Aid is the water they swim in. Like a fish doesn't think about the water. It's just in the water. And so if you're in San Francisco, you don't realize you're actually swimming in the woke Kool-Aid Aquarium. San Francisco is the woke Kool-Aid Aquarium. And so your reference point for what is centrist is totally out of whack. So Reddit is headquartered in San Francisco. Twitter was headquartered in San Francisco. You know, I moved X's headquarters to Texas, to Austin, which Austin, by the way, is still quite liberal, you know. Google's headquarters are in Palo Alto, which is still California. The engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, just on Page Mill. But even Palo Alto is way more normal than than San Francisco, Berkeley. San Francisco, Berkeley is extremely left—left of left. You can't like you need a telescope to see the center from San Francisco, you know.

**Joe:** And it used to be such a great city. I mean San Francisco has tremendous amount of inherent beauty. No question about that. The weather. And no bugs. It's just like amazing. Beautiful, you know. But you say like what's the cause of this? It's just that if you if if companies are headquartered in a location where the belief system is very far from what most people believe, then from their perspective, anything centrist is actually right-wing because they're so far left. They're so far from the center in San Francisco that anything they're—that's why that's why, you know, I think I think you're centrist. I mean I think from the perspective of someone on the far left, we look right-wing.

**Elon:** Yeah. And you know, they think anyone who's a Republican is basically like some fascist Nazi situation. But what's so crazy is if you demonstrate just from like Hillary's speeches from 2008 and Obama's speeches like on immigration—they were as far right as Steve Bannon when it comes to immigration. Yes. Hillary was like very MAGA. Have you I'm sure you've seen that campaign speech which was talking about if anybody's committing crimes—if you're here you pay a hefty fine and you have to wait in line. It was really crazy. It's crazy to listen to because it's like it's as MAGA as. Yeah. I mean, if you've seen these videos people post online where they'll take speeches from Hillary and they'll interview people on college campus or something, like "Is this a speech by Trump?" And they're like, "Oh, I hate it. He's a racist bigot."

**Joe:** No, actually that was Obama or Hillary. To your point, like literally the center's been moved so far. Yeah. Yeah. The left is so far left. They they they need, you know, they can't even see the center with a telescope. This has been after the purchasing Twitter was that was going to swipe over the whole country and change. Yeah. And so what would be rational and normal would be far left of what was rational and normal just a decade earlier. Yeah. So exactly. So historically, San Francisco, Berkeley being, you know, very far left, the sort of the fallout from the somewhat nihilistic philosophy of San Francisco, Berkeley would be limited in geography to maybe like ten miles or something. But when San Francisco and Berkeley have to be co-located with Silicon Valley with engineers who created information super-weapons that were then hijacked by the far-left activists to pump out propaganda across the entire earth.

**Elon:** Like I just you know that like old RCA radio tower thing where it's like this giant radio tower on earth and it's just broadcasting. Yeah. That's what happened. The ideology happened to be co-located with the smartest—where the smartest engineers in the world who created information super-weapons that were hijacked by the extreme activists who lived in the neighborhood. That's what happened. They hijacked the modern equivalent of the RCA radio tower and broadcast that philosophy everywhere on earth. Yeah. And you see the consequences. Particularly in places that don't have free speech. Yes. Right. Like England, you know, memes and stuff. Literally. Literally. 12,000 people this year. 12,000. 12,000. People who were arrested for posts.

**Joe:** I mean, yeah. Some of these things you read about it and it's like literally it's someone had a meme or a post. They didn't even send to anyone, right? And they got, and they and they're like—in in prison for that. Yeah. And there was a case in Germany where a woman got—a guy that raped her because of something she said on a group chat. Wow. Was it an immigrant who raped her? Yes. Yeah. It was his culture. Yeah. He didn't know. He didn't know better.

**Elon:** Yes. I think I think she said something on a group chat that wasn't very critical of his culture. And she got a longer sentence than the guy who raped her in Germany. Just the UK seems so insane. It totally insane. I actually didn't realize it was like such a—of people that got. 12,000. Yeah. Far above Russia, far above China, right? Far above anywhere on earth. UK is number one. Well, you know, things like friends of mine in England and I was like, hey, aren't you worried? Shouldn't you be protesting more?

**Joe:** And I mean the problem is that the legacy mainstream media doesn't cover the stuff. They're trying to convince people that everything's fine. Everything's fine. Most people aren't even aware of it. Until like these lovely sort of small towns in England, Scotland, Ireland, you know, they're they've been like sort of living the hobbit lifestyle, frankly. So it's in fact J.R. Tolkien based the hobbits on people he knew in small town England because they were just like lovely people who like to smoke their pipe and have nice meals and everything's pleasant. The hobbits in the Shire. The Shire. He's talking about, you know, places like Harper, like the Shire around in England, that type of thing.

**Elon:** And they've but they're the reason they've been able to enjoy the Shire is because hard men have protected them from the dark arts. And but but since they have almost no exposure to the dangers of the world, they don't realize that if a thousand people show up in your village of 500 out of nowhere and start raping the kids. This has now happened, god knows how many times in Britain. And they're literally raping. It's right like there's some 10-year-old got raped in Ireland. They snatched some kid. Yeah. Yeah. And if you criticize it, you can get arrested. It's insane. It's like how are they not? They literally criticize it. Like the I think Ireland actually, you know, posted on X because after that some I think some illegal migrant snatched a 10-year-old girl who was like going to school or something. A 10-year-old girl. And there was a you know, the people were very upset about this and they protested. Prime minister of Ireland instead of saying yeah, we shouldn't be importing violent rapists into our country—instead didn't mention that. The reason they were protesting was because a small town got raped. So there here's the question.

**Joe:** Why are they supporting this immigration? And what is this—is there a plan involved in all this? Is this just incompetence? Is this ignoring the fact that they don't have a handle on it? So they're trying to silence dissent like what is happening? Because if you wanted to destroy civilization, if you wanted to destroy Western civilization, which seems to want to do, you know, there's just so the—uh there's a guy I think who I don't know if he's been on your show. You know, who is it? Yeah, he's great. He's been on multiple times. Oh, great. That's all he's awesome. He's a good—uh way to describe it, which is suicidal empathy.

**Elon:** Yes. So is that you think is what's happening? Is that suicidal empathy? You say like, well, like you feel sorry for for something for some group and that empathy is to such a degree that it is suicidal to your country or culture. And that suicidal empathy—because I don't think we shouldn't have empathy, but we should have empathy for the victims, not just the criminals. We should have empathy for the people that they prey upon. But that suicidal empathy is also responsible for why somebody's arrested 47 times for violent offenses gets released and then goes and murders somebody in the US. That's you see that same phenomenon playing out everywhere where the suicidal empathy—we're actually allowing our women to get raped and our children to get killed. But it just doesn't seem like that would be anything that any rational society would go along with. That's what makes me so confused. It's like you're importing massive numbers of people that come from some really dark places of the world.

**Joe:** Well, there's no vetting, is the issue. It's like it's like if there's no vetting, like people are just coming through. Like well, what's to stop someone from some other country from coming to the United States or coming to Britain and just continuing their career of rape and murder? Like unless you've done unless some due diligence to say, like well, who is this person? What's their background? You haven't confirmed that they have a track record of being honest and not being a homicidal maniac, then any homicidal maniac can just come across the border. And that's not to say everyone who comes across the border, but you need some kind of process to confirm that you're not letting in people who will do some serious violence. You will get people who do serious violence sometimes. Well, especially if you don't punish them and if you don't deport them and if you keep letting them back out on the street.

**Elon:** So what is the purpose of allowing all those people into the country? It can't be—I wouldn't imagine anyone supports this. Well, let me explain. So the because you mentioned for example, Hillary and Obama have changed their tune from prior speeches where they were hard—they were hard-nosed about not letting in anyone who is a criminal into the country, you know, having secure borders and all that stuff. So why did they change their tune? The reason is that they discovered that those people vote for them. That's why they want the open borders. Because if you let people in, they know they'll vote for Democrats. Yes. If you allow them to vote, which they are actively trying to enable illegal voting. Well, California literally doesn't allow you to show your license or your ID illegal to show your photo ID when voting. Thus, effectively they've made it impossible to prove fraud.

**Joe:** Impossible. They've essentially legalized fraud in California and New York and many other parts of the country. There's no rational policy that would be the policy unless you were trying to just allow people to vote illegally. No other reason. If you need a driver's license or you need an ID for everything, if you need to prove that you were vaccinated, then the same people who are demanding that you have that vaccine passport and are the same ones saying you need no ID to vote. Same people, right?

**Elon:** But like so it's obviously hypocritical and inconsistent. So you really think it's just to get more voters? If you want to understand the policy, you have to look at the incentives. So once the Democratic Party in the US and the left in Europe realized that if you have open borders and you provide a ton of government handouts, which creates a massive pull for people from other countries to come to your country, and you don't prosecute them, they're going to be beholden to you and they will vote for you. And that's why Obama and Hillary went from being against open borders to being in favor of open borders. That's the reason—in order to import voters so they can win elections. And the problem is that that has a negative runaway effect. So if they get away with that, like it is a winning strategy. If they get away with it, they will import enough voters to get a supermajority voting bloc that they can't be voted out. And then you know, we talked about this before the election. And then you literally pointed out and said that if you do not vote now, you might not ever be able to do it again because they'll keep the borders open for another four years and it'll be overrun.

**Joe:** Yes. They'll keep importing voters. And the objective will be achieved. Correct? If if Trump had lost, there would never be another real election again. Because Trump is actually enforcing the border. Now you can point to situations where there's been enforcement that's been overzealous. Because they're not going to be perfect. There'll be cases where they've been over-aggressive. So but if you say that the standard must be perfection for expelling illegals, then you will not get any expulsion because perfection is impossible. And you've probably got millions of people that are here that are trying to be honest, right? Yes. Like you could just come from a war-torn part of the world. No, they're trying to be economic asylum, which is everybody. Which is everybody. Yeah. So asylum is supposed to mean that if you go back to your country, you'll get killed. You know, that's what it's supposed to be. But they changed the definition of asylum to be you will have a decreased standard of living, which is obviously not real asylum. And you can test that people who are asylum seekers go on vacation to the country that they're seeking asylum from.

**Elon:** You know, that doesn't make any sense. Yeah. It doesn't have to. But when you understand the incentives, then you understand the behavior that illegals will vote for them if they allow them if they have open borders and combine that with government handouts. Yeah, to create a massive incentive. They're basically using US and Europe—US and European taxpayer dollars to provide a financial incentive to bring in as many illegals as possible to vote them into permanent power into a one-party state. And I invite anyone who's listening to this to just do any research and the more you dig into it, the more it will become obvious that what I'm saying is absolutely correct. There are people to swing states. It's clear that they were trying to do something. And Pelosi, who are actively talking about the need to bring in people to make them—collapse. Yes. Yeah. No, that's it's that meme. Yeah. Where so many people by saying it's not true, it's a right-wing conspiracy theorist, right?

**Joe:** I think the next step is well, it might be true, and then it's like okay, it is true, but here's why. And then the final step is it's true and here's why it's good. Well, wait a second you started off saying it's untrue and it's a right-wing conspiracy theorist thing and we must do more of it. Well, this is the thing about Medicaid and Social Security numbers. You know that we're massive fraud. It's massive fraud. And they denied it forever. And now we're finding out this is part of the reason why there's this standoff going on right now.

**Elon:** Yes. The entire basis for the government shutdown is that the Trump administration correctly does not want to send massive amounts of hundreds of billions of dollars to fund illegal immigrants in the blue states or in all the states really. And so the Democrats want to keep the money spigot going to incentivize illegal immigrants to come into the country. That's the crux of the battle. So what they want to stop this. So what's going on right now is they have been funding these people. They've been giving them Medicaid. And more than that, just like the hotels like four and five-star hotels like the Roosevelt Hotel being the classic example. I think $60 million a year to the Roosevelt Hotel to which all it did was provide housing in a nice hotel. I mean, it still is a nice hotel. And all around the country, this was happening and all tax dollars. Yes. Yeah. And the Trump administration cut off funding for example to the Roosevelt Hotel and these other hotels saying like we—it's US tax dollars should not be paid to have luxury hotels for illegal immigrants that American citizens can't even afford.

**Joe:** Which obviously is the right call. That's what was happening. They were also giving out like debit cards with $1,000. So it's not just about medical care. The Democrats mention the medical care because they're trying to prey on people's empathy. Oh wow, somebody has a desperately-needed medical procedure. And shouldn't we take care of them in that regard? But what they do is they divert the Medicaid slush fund for the states that goes well beyond emergency medical care. And New York and California would be bankrupt without the massive fraudulent federal payments that go to those states to pay for illegals. How would they be bankrupt because of that? They wouldn't be bankrupt because they can just issue currency like the Federal Reserve can. And so their ability to balance a budget is dependent upon illegals getting funding. The scam level here is so staggering. There are hundreds of billions of dollars of transfer payments from the federal government to the states.

**Elon:** Those transfer payments—the states self-report what those transfer payment numbers should be. So California and New York and Illinois lie like crazy and say that these are all legitimate payments. Well, these days they I think they're even admitting hundreds of billions of dollars for illegals. But for a while there, you get these transfer payments for every government program you can point to, and they are self-reported by the state. And at least historically, there was some oversight. New York, Illinois, and other states—when they would lie, there was someone saying, "Hey, you're lying. These payments are fraudulent." Now under the Trump administration, does not want to send hundreds of billions of dollars of fraudulent payments. The standoff is because if the hundreds of billions of dollars to create a financial incentive to have this giant magnet to attract illegals from every part of earth to the United States, they will leave because they're no longer being paid to come to the United States and stay here.

**Joe:** Wow. And then they will lose a lot of voters. The Democratic party will lose a lot of voters and they would crash. If this is kicked out of reintroducing it into a new bill. Yes. Especially once normalizing. Yes. So like in a nutshell, the Democratic party wants to destroy democracy by importing voters. And you know, the Republican party disagrees with that. And the ruse is that if you don't vote, you're destroying democracy. Yes. By importing voters and incentivizing people to only vote for them and overwhelming the system. Yes. And by the way, it's a strategy that if allowed to work would work and in fact has worked.

**Elon:** California has a supermajority. Yeah. And there's so much gerrymandering that that occurs. It's crazy. I'm sure you're paying attention to this Proposition 50 thing. That's the thing where they're trying to redo districts. Yeah. Because I mean California is already gerrymandered like crazy. Yeah. They want to gerrymander it even more. And because it keeps moving further and further right. Like if you look at the map of California and more people are waking up and going what the fuck and we need to do something different. The available other than the policies that you guys have always done is go right. And then people get so called red-pilled. Yeah. And there's another thing that is very important that is actually not disputed by either side, which is that when we do the census, the way the census works for apportionment of congressional seats and electoral college votes for the president is by number of persons in a state, not number of citizens, right?

**Joe:** It's number of people. So you could literally—how do they do the census when they do that? Do they ask—do they ask you—do they knock on doors? Do they have them fill out forms? Like what? Yeah, forms and knock on doors. But the way the law reads right now, and especially if you're in a blue state, it's if you are a human with a pulse, then you count in the census for allocating congressional seats and presidential votes. Right? So electoral college. It doesn't matter whether you're here legally or illegally. And if you're a human—congressional apportionment. So that means that the more people, the more illegals that California and New York can import, when by the time the census comes up for congressional seats, they will have and the more electoral the more presidential—they will have. So they're trying to get as many illegals in as possible ahead of the census.

**Elon:** Because all human beings, even tourists, count for the census. And then if you combine that with gerrymandering of districts in New York and California, as you point out with this proposition where there's so much amount of gerrymandering that occurs in California, the biggest state in the country—if this—if this the census then would award more congressional seats to California and New York and Illinois. So they get more congressional seats. They would get more presidential electoral college votes. They would get them—they would get to decide who is president based literally based on legal immigration. These are not disputed facts by either party.

**Joe:** I want to emphasize that that's not even controversial. These are just this is just the way the law works. It is a feature. You know, like I don't think the law should work that way. I think it should only be proportionate to citizens. But isn't that a problem with how the constitution was written? Well, that's—I'm not sure if it's constitutional or something. But it is the way the law is written. So it is an incentive. But it's something simple that makes sense to everybody that only the people that should be able to vote—only US citizens, yes. So the way it should work is that only US citizens count in the census for purposes of determining voting power. Because people that aren't citizens are not supposed to be voting supposedly. They're not supposed to be voting. But they do. But even besides that, like I said, I just can't emphasize this enough because the law as it stands counts all humans with a pulse in a state for deciding how many house of representative votes and how many presidential electoral college votes a state gets.

**Elon:** So the incentive therefore is for California, New York, and Illinois to maximize the number of illegal immigrants so that they take house seats away from red states and assign them to California and New York and forth. And then you combine that with extreme gerrymandering in you know California, New York, Illinois and whatnot. So that basically you control then they get control of the presidency, control of the house, then they keep doing this and end up with a supermajority. That is what they're trying to do. So that would essentially turn the entire country into California. Yes. Where you have differing opinions, but it doesn't really matter because Democrats are always in control. Yes. When you first started digging into this, when you first started before you even accepted this role of running DOGE and being a part of all that, did you have any idea that it was this fucked up? When did you start knowing?

**Joe:** Well, about two years ago. Isn't that crazy? Yeah, like relatively recently, you know. So maybe I started I started like basically having a bad feeling about three years ago, which is why I felt it was critical to acquire Twitter and have a maximally truth-seeking platform. Otherwise they suppress the truth. And like it was more like I'm not sure what's going on, but I have a bad feeling about what's happening. But the more I dug into it, the more I was like, holy shit, we got a real problem here and America's going to collapse. So without anyone knowing it had fallen. That's that would be the problem. Without anyone really being aware of what had happened, especially if you didn't—yes, that's it. Look, buying Twitter was a huge pain in the ass. And they all launched attacks. Like dab dab stab dab dab. Everybody loved you before that.

**Elon:** Well, some lefties loved you. I was a hero of the left. As far as the thing, if you demonstrated that you were environmentally conscious and you were on the right side. Yeah, I mean, I'm still the same human. I didn't have a brain transplant before three years ago, you know. Well, that's my favorite bumper sticker that people put—I took a picture of one the other day. Oh, you found somebody. Oh, yeah. I've seen that people that have these bumper stickers on their car that says, "I bought this before I realized he's a Nazi." Yeah. Because people were vandalizing Teslas. Yeah. The most—there was organized campaign to literally burn down Teslas, and we had one of our dealers got shot up with a gun. Like they fired bullets into the Tesla dealership.

**Joe:** That's crazy. But the bumper sticker should read—there should be an addendum to the bumper sticker. It's like I bought this car before I realized he's not crazy and I've seen the light. That'll take some time. That'll take some time. People don't want to admit that they got fooled. Yeah. I mean, there's that old saying where it's like it's really easy to fool someone but it's much harder to convince someone that they were fooled. Yeah. It's much easier to fool them than to convince them they were fooled. People cling to their ideas. Yes. They especially if they've publicly stated their beliefs are very embarrassed of being foolish. Yeah. People most time they double down. And they find echo chambers. Yeah. Yeah. But there's you know the thing is that I you know, I've seen more and more people who were convinced of the sort of woke ideology see the light.

**Elon:** Yeah. So not everyone, but it's more and more are seeing the light. Yeah. And it tends to happen like when something happens that really, you know, directly impacts them. Like there was a guy I know who was living in the San Francisco Bay area and that tried to trans his daughter. Did like to the point where the school—sent the police to his house to take his daughter away from him. Now that's going to radicalize you. Well, that's going to break—that's going to break it. Yeah, because now I know, so it was an activist at the school that was trying to do this. Yeah, the school and the state of California conspired to turn his daughter into—take life-altering drugs that would have sterilized her and had irreversible effects.

**Joe:** And how old was she? I think 14, something like that. Yeah. So and because he managed to talk the police out of taking his daughter away from him that day, he got her on a plane to Texas. Wow. And like, you know, a year after just being in a school in like greater Austin area, she went back to normal.

**Elon:** Meaning like it it wasn't real, right? Well, people are being much more open to that now. I mean the Wall Street Journal had that opinion piece yesterday that this whole trans thing—there's a lot of evidence is a social contagion. Absolutely. And Colin Wright wrote that. And the fact is, of course. And on Blue Sky, there's people talking about exterminating him, which is insane. You're allowed to say horrible things about people saying possibly truthful things—a social contagion. Because that's what—when you get nine kids that are in a friend group—yeah. Something's wrong. That's not statistically—yeah. Like here's the—like you know how you can convince kids to do anything. You can convince kids to be a suicide bomber, right? Because they're susceptible to that kind of influence and brainwashing.

**Joe:** Kids are kids. And and the idea that that's not the case—kids are easily corruptible. You're also seeing a lot of push back from the LGBT saying like, hey, if someone stops including me in—yeah. Exactly. The LGBT, you know, the second—why are we being included all the time in this situation? Exactly. Exactly. You know, like my friend Tim Dylan's talked about this, like it's really homophobic. Like, hey, you're not gay. You're actually a girl. Yes. And you know, hey, hey—so that you can never have an orgasm again and you'll be happy. Like, yeah, it's castration of kids.

**Elon:** Like I think I think we should look at anyone who permanently castrates a kid as like right up there with Josef Mengele. Yeah. I mean, they're mutilating children. Yeah. Yeah. And I think it's being kind. And the thing is, would you rather have a live daughter or a dead son? That's the line they use. Yeah. Which is not supported by data. Suicide increases, right? This is important, maybe for the audience to know. The fact is suicide increases if you're a trans kid, not decreases. By some accounts, it triples. So that is an evil lie. And it's a lie that is supposedly compassionate. Imagine you've twisted reality to the point where confusing a child that's not even legally allowed to get a fucking tattoo—yeah. Right. Because you think that that's—removable thing, right? If I wanted to, tomorrow I can go to a doctor and they can remove it. Right. Okay. No harm, no foul. Yeah. But you get sterilized—like that's it forever.

**Joe:** Forever. Yes, they'll castrate you. You no longer have testicles. You have no penis. A hole where your penis used to be. Yes. And this is compassionate and this is presented with these sex change operations. They die—the number of deaths on the operating table—a lot of kids because we don't really have the technology to make this work. So a bunch of the times the kids just die in the surgery. Jesus Christ. Yeah. It's demented. Which it should be viewed as like, you know, evil Nazi doctor stuff, basically. That's why it was like real Nazi, not the fucking—crazy that even pushing back against something that seems like fundamentally logical, very easy to argue, the old Twitter would ban you forever.

**Elon:** That's how crazy a social contagion can get when it completely defies logic, viscerally makes no sense, does not supported by data—all connected to this ideology that we have to protect trans kids. Yeah. And what I want to emphasize is that the savings—the lie. If if you castrate kids and trans them, the probability of suicide increases. It does not decrease. It substantially increases. The studies that I've seen, the risk of suicide triples if you transition kids. So you're not saving them, you're killing them. Moreover, there are deaths that occur during the sex change operation. Jesus Christ. It's just crazy that this is a real issue. Yeah, it's a nightmare fever dream. And people are finally waking up from it.

**Joe:** Now when you started getting into DOGE stuff and started finding how much money is being shuffled around and moved around to NGOs and how much money is involved and just totally untraceable funding. This is again something like two years plus ago. You weren't aware of it all. No, I was aware of it. I just didn't realize how big it was. Just just how much waste and fraud there is in the government is truly vast. And the government didn't even know and nor did they care. That's crazy. Yeah. And I mean just like some of the very basic stuff that DOGE did will have lasting effects.

**Elon:** And some of these things—I like some of them I can hardly believe it. So the DOGE team got the most of the main payments computers to require the congressional appropriation code. So when a payment is made, you have to actually enter the congressional appropriation code, which was optional and often would be just left blank. So the money would just go out without anyone knowing the congressional appropriation. Then the DOGE team also made the comment field for the payment mandatory. So you have to say something. We're not saying it has to be accurate. You your cat could run across the keyboard. You could go querty qwerty. Something. Above nothing. Because what we found was that there were tens of billions of dollars that were zombie payments.

**Joe:** So there like somebody had approved a payment or approved a payment and some recurring payment. And they retired or died or changed jobs and no one turned the money off. So the money would just keep going out. And it's a pretty rare go where you're not going to complain that you're getting money that you should not get. Just going to the state. These are automatic payments to the states. So these are automatic payments and no accounting for them at all. I imagine like like there's an automatic debit of your account statement, right? So it's just money going out. That's why I call them zombie payments. The payments—there might have been legitimate at one time. There might have been a recurring payment. Someone changed jobs, died, retired, or whatever, and no one ever turned it off. And my guess is that's probably at least a hundred billion a year. Maybe 200.

**Elon:** And all going where to where—I mean there are millions of these payments. So millions—yes. Millions of payments that are going to who knows where. Yes. In a bunch of cases, rings that operate—professional fraud rings that operate to exploit the system. And there's a hole in the system and they just do professional fraud. And you know, that's where we found for example, people who were 300 years old in the database. Now I thought that this was a mistake of not registering their deaths. That people were born like a long time ago and it had defaulted to like a certain number. And so after time those people were still in the system. It was the accounting was done. Yeah. So that's not true. So there's or at least one of two things must be true. There's a typo or some mistake in the computer, or it's fraudulent. But we don't have any 300-year-old vampires living in America. Allegedly. Allegedly.

**Joe:** And they there—people in some cases who's receiving payments who are born in the future. Born in the future. Really? Yes. There are people receiving payments whose birth date was like in 2100 and something. Okay, so there's like next century. Is there a task—we know one of two things must be true. There's a mistake in the computer or it's fraud. But if you have someone's birth date that's either in the future or where they are older than the oldest living American, more than 114 years, there is either a mistake and someone should call the person and think we have your birthday wrong because it says you were born in 1806 or you know, before you know, before there was really an America.

**Elon:** You know, it was like sort of early—you know, we're still fighting England type of thing. This person either needs to be in the Guinness Book of World Records or they're not alive. But at the end of the day, money is going towards someone connected to this person that is either non-existent or... Yeah. So I think something like 20 million people in the Social Security Administration database that could not possibly be alive. If their birth date they could not possibly be alive. And then to be clear, 20 million people that are in the database, a bunch of most of them were not receiving funds. Some of them were receiving funds. Most were not. But so let me understand this. The Social Security Administration database is used as the source of truth by all the other databases. Even if they stop the payments on the Social Security Administration database, like the Small Business Administration, student loans—all check the Social Security Administration database.

**Joe:** Is this a legitimate alive person? And if the Social Security database says yes, this person is still alive, even though they're 200 years old? Yeah. It just says—it just returns when the computer is queried, it says yes, this person is alive. And so then they're able to exploit the entire thing. So fake—then you get fake student loans, then you get fake unemployment insurance and other government payments. And this doesn't have to be tied to an individual where there's any tracking on this person. No, if you did do any check at all, you would stop the fraud. So that's—that's so. And how much money do you think is any fraud would stop would stop the forward? Like any effort at all?

**Elon:** Yeah. So there's multiple layers. The Social Security number verifies that this is a person. And so every other government payment and every other government payment system—Federal Business Administration, student loans, Medicaid, Medicare, every other government payment, of which there are many—there are hundreds of government payment systems. If the Social Security database says this person is alive, that's the nature of the scam. It's a bank shot. So then the then the rebuttal from the Dems is like, oh well, the vast majority of these people who are allegedly alive in the Social Security Administration weren't receiving Social Security Administration payments. But they're getting fraudulent payments from every other government program. And that's the case. All this is it is trackable? Like all this? If they wanted to, they could chase it all down. Yeah. It's not even hard. And yet they don't want to chase it all down. They're opposing chasing it all down because it would turn off the money spigot.

**Joe:** Wow. Because it's very logical to like, like I'm saying the most common sense things possible. If someone's got a birthday in Social Security that is an impossible birthday, meaning they are older than the oldest living American or were born in the future, then you should call them up and say, hey, we must have your birthday wrong, right? Because it says that you're 200 years old. That's not right. You know? And then you would remove them from the Social Security database and make sure to turn off all the other government payments. Exactly. Wow. And how much money are we talking? It's hundreds of billions of dollars.

**Elon:** And it could hunt all like you don't need to be Sherlock Holmes here is what I'm saying. You don't need to be Sherlock Holmes for this one. Is this part of you just need to call the person and be like, hey, we seem to have the like—we must have your birthday wrong because it says you were born in the future. Could you tell us what your birthday is? That's all you need to do. That simple. But the all these other government payments that are available to the Social Security number—it seems like if you just chased that all down—you would find the widespread fraud. You would find where it's going. Yes. The backbone is the Social Security Administration database because the Social Security number in the United States is used as a de facto national ID number. You know, that's why, like the bank always asks for your Social—like the you know your Social Security number.

**Joe:** This sounds so insane that this isn't chased down. I mean I agree that this is that's such mishandling. Yes. No, it's mind-blowing.

**Elon:** So yeah, it's crazy. Well, you were very reluctant last time you were here to talk about the extent of some of the fraud because you're like, look, you can manage fraud. What? Yeah. What I was saying is that if you create—if you like to be pragmatic and realistic—you actually can't manage to zero fraud. You can manage to low fraud. But if you manage to zero fraud, you're going to push so many people over the edge that the number of inbound homicidal maniacs will be really hard to overcome. So I'm actually taking I think quite a reasonable position, which is to reduce the amount of fraud, which I think is not an extremist position. And we should aspire to, you know, have less fraud over time. Not that we should be ultra-draconian and eliminate every last scrap of fraud, which I guess would be nice to have. But like we don't even need to go that far. We just need to address the obvious fraud. I think that's a reasonable position.

**Joe:** It's a very reasonable position. And so what was the most shocking pushback that you got when you started implementing DOGE? When you started investigating into where money was going?

**Elon:** Well, I guess this—I should have anticipated this, but while most of the fraudulent government payments to especially to the NGOs go to the Democrats, most of it, like I don't know for argument's sake, let's say 80% goes to Democrats. 20% does go to Republicans. And so when we'd turn off funding to a fraudulent NGO, whatever—the 10% of Republicans who were receiving the money would complain. Because the honest answer is the Republicans are—they're receiving some of the fraud too. They're getting—Jesus. Yeah, it's I want to be clear. It's not like the Republican party is some ultra-pure paragon of virtue here. No. Okay. Like you see that with the congressional insider trading. It's across both parties. Yeah. It's left and right. I mean, the whole uni-party criticism has some validity there. And it's like if you turn off fraudulent payments, it's not like 100% of those payments were going to Democrats. A small percentage of Republicans. Those Republicans complained very loudly.

**Joe:** And so there was a lot of pushback on the Republican side for when we started cutting some of these funds, and I tried to like, you know, 90% of the money is going to your opponents, but they still—if they're getting 10% of it, they want their piece. Yeah. They want their peace and they complained loud. Did you see—this is why, like, you know, politics is like it's dirty business. Yeah, you know, if if you like sausages and respect the law, do not watch either one made. Yeah. Wow. Well, that's not even true because I've made sausage before. Yeah. Yeah. It's actually like it's not that big a deal. Yeah. You just run it through the machine. Not that big a deal. Yeah. But I mean I think the stuff I'm saying here is not like—like if you stand back and think about it, it makes sense, you know? It's not like—like it's not like one political party is going to be pure devil or pure angel. There's much more corruption on the Republican side.

**Elon:** How did it happen that the majority of the corruption is on the Democratic side? Well, because the transfer payments, especially to illegals, are very much on the Democrat side. That so that's the root of it all is the transfer payments or a focal point. Yes. It's also like it's it's—it would also be accurate to say that while obviously not everyone who is a Democrat is a criminal, almost everyone who is a criminal is a Democrat. Because the Democrats are the soft crime party. So if you're a criminal, you'll find a much better environment in Democratic jurisdictions. Right. Right. The soft crime party. Did you think you were going to be able to get as much done as you were? We did get a lot done, right?

**Joe:** And DOGE is still—still still happening, by the way. This the DOGE is still underway. There are still there are still waste and fraud being cut by the DOGE team. So it hasn't stopped. It's less publicized. It's less publicized. Like a clear person to attack anymore. Well, it seems like they basically—they applied immense pressure to me to just stop it. So then I'm like the best thing is that I cut out of this. In any case, as a special government employee, I could only be something like that. So whatever the law says. So I could—I was necessarily a special government employee. So but yeah, I mean you turn off the money spigot to fraudsters, they get very upset to say the least. And my death threat level went ballistic, you know, was like a rocket going to orbit.

**Elon:** Yeah. So but now that I'm not in DC, I guess they don't really have a person to attack anymore. Well, the rhetoric about you has calmed down significantly. Yeah, it was distressing to watch. It was like this is crazy. And to watch these politicians engage in it and framing you as this monster. I was like, this is so weird. Like this is what happens. Yes. The whole machine turns on you. And if it wasn't for a person like you who had independent money, like could have destroyed you. Yeah. And that was the goal. The goal was to stop you. Because you were getting in the way of this amazing graft. The gigantic graft. Yeah.

**Joe:** I like I think the DOGE team's done a lot of good work. You know, in terms of fraud and waste prevented, my guess is it's probably on the order of two or 300 billion a year. So it's pretty good. What do you think if you just had like full reign and total cooperation? How much do you think you could cut? I mean, what level of power are we assuming here? Godlike. Oh, yeah. I probably could cut the federal budget in half and get more done. That is so crazy. It is so crazy to get more done and the federal budget is gone. Widespread. It's that widespread. Well, I mean a whole bunch of government departments are in my opinion. They they you know, like examples of well, the Department of Education, which was created recently in the late 70s.

**Elon:** Educational results have gone downhill ever since it was created. So if you if you create a department and the result of creating that department is that results decline, and it's department of education, you're better off not having it. Because the results were better before there was one than after when you let the states run it. Yes. Yeah. The states compete with one another. So but the problem is like here, cutting department of education—our kids need education. Yeah, they do. But this is a new department, you know, until late the late 70s. And ever since that department was created, the educational results have declined. And so why would you have an institution that continue that has made education worse? It doesn't make sense. They killed it, though, right?

**Joe:** No, there still unfortunately. But they were trying to. Okay. What other organizations, what other departments? Well, I mean, I'm a small government guy. So when the country was created, we just had the department of state, department of war, sort of the department of justice. We had an attorney general, and I don't know why you need more than that. So what other departments specifically do you think are just completely ineffective?

**Elon:** Well, I mean, here it's like a question of how much government do you think there should be? I believe in the least amount of government. I've heard the most bizarre argument against this is it's gonna leave people jobless. And I'm like, but their jobs are useless. Yeah. Paying people to do nothing doesn't make sense. There's like a great story about like Milton Friedman, who is awesome. I'm not sure if it's apocryphal or not—attributed to him. Like he observed, I think people that were like digging ditches with you know with shovels. And he said, well, I think you should use excavating equipment. You could get it done with far fewer people. And then someone said, but then people would lose their jobs. Well, then Friedman says, well, in that case, why don't you have them dig ditches with teaspoons? Think of all the jobs you'll create.

**Joe:** I mean, it's bullshit. Basically, you just want people to work on things that are valuable. You want people to work on building things. On building, you know, providing products and services that people find valuable. Like you know making food, being a farmer or a plumber or electrician or just anyone who's building things. And that's what you want people to be doing. Not fake government jobs that don't add any value or may subtract value. And there's also like, you know, to illustrate the absurdity of, also how is the economy measured? Like the way economists measure the economy, they'll measure any job, no matter even if that job is a dumb job that has no point. Like the joke is like there's two economists going on a hike in the mountains. And they come across a pile of shit. And one economist says to the other, I'll pay you $100 to eat that shit.

**Elon:** The economist eats the shit and gets $100. They keep walking. Then the other—then come across another pile of shit. And the other says, now I'll pay you $100 to eat the pile of shit. So pays the other economist $100, pile of shit. Then they then then then they said, like wait a second, we both just ate a pile of shit and we're no—and we're—we we don't have any more extra money. Like we both—you just gave the $100 back to me. This doesn't make any sense. And they said, no, no, but think of the economy boost. The way we measure the economy, that basically would count as a transaction in the GDP. It's a job. This is to illustrate the absurdity of economics. One of the things you said is when things should not count as a job. One of the things that you're kind of done and that it's unfixable. That, well, or under its current form, the way people are approaching it, you can make it directionally better, but ultimately you can't fully fix it.

**Joe:** So I like—like, like it it is it would be accurate to say that even like—unless you could go full draconian like, you know, Genghis Khan level on cutting waste and fraud, which you can't really do in a democratic country—an aspirationally democratic country—then there's no way to solve the debt crisis. So we got a national debt that's just insane where the debt payments, the interest on the national debt is bigger than the entire military budget. I mean, that's one that was one of the wakeup calls for me. The second—the interest on a national debt is bigger than the entire military budget and growing. This is crazy. So even if you implement all these savings, you're only delaying the day of reckoning for when America goes bankrupt.

**Elon:** Genghis Khan, which you can't really do. So I came to the conclusion that the only way to get us out of the debt crisis and to prevent America from going bankrupt is AI and robotics. So like we need to grow the economy at a rate that allows us to pay off our debt. And I guess people just generally don't appreciate the degree to which the government overspending is a problem. But even like this is under the Biden administration. On the website, it would say like we're projecting and how much money Social Security is bringing in versus how much it's paying out. There are because we have an aging population. The average—Social Security will not be able to maintain its full payments. I think in by 2034 or something like that. There. Okay. So they will start reducing their payments. Seven years.

**Joe:** And so the only way to fix that is with AI, robotics manufacturing. Raise GDP. You've got to basically massively increase the economic output. The economy. And the only way to do that is AI and robotics. So basically, we're going bankrupt without AI and robotics. Even with a bunch of savings. The savings—the savings—reducing waste and fraud can give us a longer runway, but it cannot ultimately pay off our national debt. So what do you think about the jobs that are going to be lost because of AI and robotics?

**Elon:** The jobs—do we need human beings to do these jobs because AI is doing them. Do you think there's going to be like universal basic income thing? Do you think there's going to be some other kind of outcome? Because a lot of people are going to be out of work, right? I think there will be high demand for jobs, but not necessarily the same jobs. So I mean, this actually this process has been happening throughout modern history. I mean, there used to be like doing calculations manually with a pencil and paper. It used to be a job. So they used to have like computers. Where the banks would like all you do all day is do calculations because they didn't have computers. They didn't have digital computers.

**Joe:** Yeah. Well, it was just people would just like add and subtract stuff on piece of paper. They would be how banks would do, you know, financial processing and you'd have to literally just verify that the numbers are balanced. Yeah. And most times it's just simple math. Like you know the basics. Before computers, how did you calculate? How did you do transactions? You had people. So then when computers were introduced, the job of doing, you know, bank calculations no longer existed. So people had to go do something else. And that's what's going to happen—that's what is happening at an accelerating rate with robotics.

**Elon:** Then robotics. That's the issue, though, right? The accelerated rate because it's like a supersonic tsunami. So that's what I call it—supersonic tsunami. So what other jobs will be available that aren't available now because of AI? Well, AI will improve the productivity of humans who build things with their hands or do things with their hands like plumbing, you know, welding, electrical work, plumbing, anything that's physically moving atoms. Like cooking food or farming or like anything that's physical—those jobs will exist for a much longer time. But anything that is digital, which is like just someone at a computer doing something, AI is going to take over those jobs like—coding, anything along those lines. Yeah, it's going to take over those jobs like digital computers took over the job of people doing manual calculations. But but what happens to all those people? Like what kind of numbers are we talking about?

**Joe:** You're going to have automated vehicles, AI-controlled systems just like in Singapore where everything's completely automated. Yeah. Mostly. Yeah. Yeah. So you're going to lose a lot of those jobs. Long-shoreman jobs, trucking jobs. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we actually do have a shortage of truck drivers, but there's—there's many illegals to do it. Have you seen those numbers? Yeah. The problem is when people don't know how to drive a semi-truck, which is actually a huge responsibility, and you can kill people. Yeah. A friend of mine's wife was killed by an illegal driver. She was just out biking. And there was an illegal—he didn't know how to drive the truck or something. I mean, he ran over her.

**Elon:** So I mean, like for something like you can't you can't let people drive, you know, sort of an 80,000-pound semi if they don't know how to do it. But in California, they're just letting people do it. Well, they also need—they want the votes and that kind of thing. But but yeah, like cars are going to be autonomous. But there's just so many desk jobs where really people, what people are doing is answering the phone. And just anything that isn't moving atoms—like anything that is not physically doing physical work—those jobs will obviously be eliminated by AI at a very rapid pace. And ultimately working will be optional because you'll have robots plus AI. And we'll have in a benign scenario, universal high income. Not just universal basic income—universal high income. Meaning you can have any services that they want. So but there will be a lot of trauma and disruption.

**Joe:** So you anticipate a basic income from that? That the economy will boost to such an extent that a high income would be available to almost everybody. So we'd essentially not have to work? In the benign scenario, yes. So like the way there are multiple scenarios. There are multiple scenarios. There's a lot of ways this movie can end. Like the safety is that like one of the possibilities is the Terminator scenario. It's not good. So that's why I'm like really banging the drum on AI needs to be maximally truth-seeking. Like don't make—I don't force AI to believe a lie like that—for example, the founding fathers were women. Or that misgendering is worse than nuclear war. Because if that's the values, if that becomes the case, and then the AI becomes omnipotent, it can enforce that outcome.

**Elon:** And then—unless you're a diverse woman, you're out of the picture. So we're toast. So that's or you might get forcibly trans'd into a diverse woman one day. We adjust the picture and we are now everyone's a diverse woman. So that would be that's the worst possible situation. So what would be the steps that we would have to take in order to implement the benign solution where it's universal high income? Like best case scenario? This is the path forward to universal high income. For essentially every single citizen that the economy gets boosted by AI and robotics to such an extent that no one ever has to work again. And what about meaning? Gets really weird.

**Joe:** Yeah. I don't know how to answer the question about meaning. That's an individual problem, right? But it's going to be an issue. Yeah. Well, I mean, I guess I've like—for years I've fought against saying like, you know, I you know, I've been a voice saying like, hey, we need to slow down, all these AI things. We need to slow down, and we need to not have a crazy AI race. I've been saying that for a long time. For 20 years or so. You know, I came to realize that really there's two choices here. Either be a spectator, and I'm a spectator, I can't really influence the direction of AI. But if I actually participate, I can influence the direction of AI.

**Elon:** And have a maximally truth-seeking AI with good values. That's what we're trying to create with Grock at XAI. And you know, the research showed like when they compared—like how do AIs value the weight of human life? Grock was the only one—the only one of the AIs that weighted human life equally. And didn't say like a white guy's worth 1/20th of a black woman's life. Literally, that's what they calculated they came up with. So I'm like, this is very alarming. We should want that to happen in order to reach this benign solution. Yeah. We I just keep the best movie ending. Yeah. You want a curious truth-seeking AI. And I think a curious truth-seeking AI will want to foster humanity. Because we're much more interesting than a bunch of rocks.

**Joe:** Like you say, like I love Mars, you know, but Mars is kind of boring. Like it's just a bunch of red rocks. It's got, you know, the biggest ravine and the tallest mountain. But there's no animals or plants. And there's no people. And you know, so humanity is just much more interesting if you're a curious truth-seeking AI. Much more interesting. I mean like as humans, we could go for example and eliminate all chimps. If we put our minds to it, we could—eliminate all chimps and all gorillas. But we don't. There's been encroachment on their environment, but we actually try to preserve the chimp and gorilla habitats. And I think in a good scenario, AI would do the same with humans.

**Elon:** It would actually foster human civilization and care about human happiness. So this is the thing I try to achieve, I think. But what is the landscape look like if you have Grock competing with Open AI, competing with all these different companies? Like how does it work? Like what if you have AIs that have been captured by ideologies that are side by side competing with Grock? Like how do we so—this is one of the reasons why I felt like it's important to not just be an observer but participate. And then have Grock be more successful and more potent than these other applications. Yes, as long as there's at least one AI that is maximally truth-seeking, you know, and for example, weighs all human lives equally. And doesn't favor one race or gender, then then that and people are able to look at look at, you know, Grock at XAI and compare that. And say, why are the other AIs being basically sexist and racist?

**Joe:** And then that causes some embarrassment for the other AIs and then they they improve. They tend to improve. So like acquiring Twitter and allowing the truth to be told and not suppressing the truth helped media companies to be more truthful. By in the same way, having Grock be a maximally truth-seeking, curious AI will force the other AI companies to also be more truth-seeking and fair. And the funniest thing is even though leftists are in opposition to a lot of your ideas, but if this gets implemented and you really do achieve universal high income, that's the greatest socialist solution of all time. Like literally, no one will have to work.

**Elon:** Correct. Like I said, so there is a benign scenario here, which I think probably people will be happy with if if as long as it's with abundance. Which is—if everyone can have every like like if if you ask people like what's the future that you want? That that future is attainable with AI and robotics. But you know, it's like I said there's not every path is a good path. I think if we if we push it in the direction of maximally truth-seeking and curious, then I think AI will want to take care of humanity and foster humanity because we're interesting. And if it hasn't been programmed to think that like all straight white males should die, which Gemini was basically programmed to—at first. You know, they seem to have fixed it. I hope they fixed it.

**Joe:** Like, oh, we're getting away from that mindset and that people realize how preposterous it is? We are getting away from it. So we're at least—it knows to hide things. But like I said, there's that—I think my pinned post on X, which was like, hey, wait a second, guys, we still have every AI except Grock is saying that basically straight white males should die. And this is a problem and we should fix it. And you know, but simply me saying that is—tends to generally result in, you know, them like that—is kind of bad. Maybe we should—we should not have that. I think they say also all straight Asian males should also die as well. Like the generally the AI and the media—which backs back the media was, you know, racist against black people and sexist against women. Back in the day. Now now it is racist against white people and Asians. And sexist against men.

**Elon:** So they just—like generally, they just want to change the target. But really, the solution is just shouldn't be racist and sexist at all. You know, ideally that would be nice. That would be nice. And it's kind of crazy that people, and then everything ramped up online and everybody was accused of being a Nazi or racist and sexist and homophobic and everything got exaggerated to the point where everyone was a colluding—like everyone was a hall monitor looking for racism. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Well, we've got—but they they were openly anti-white and often openly anti-Asian. And they they claim that you cannot be racist against white people because racism is power and influence. Okay.

**Joe:** No, it's not. Yeah. Racism is racism in the absolute. So you know, just needs to be consistency. So if it's okay to have, let's say black or Asian or Indian or pride, it should be okay to have white pride too. Yeah. Consistency question. So if it's okay to be proud of one religion, it should be okay to be proud of all religions. Provide that they don't like don't don't—as long as part of that religion isn't exterminating people who are not in that religion type, right?

**Elon:** So it's really just like a consistency bias. Or or just like ensuring consistency to eliminate bias. So if it is possible to be racist against one race, it is possible to be racist against any race. So of course, logically. Yes. Yeah. And arguing against that is that's when you know you're catching a—it's a lie. And people and people go insane. Yes. But like the like you can't simultaneously say that there's systemic racist oppression but also that races don't exist—that race is a social construct. Like which is it?

**Joe:** You know, you also can't say that anybody who steps foot in America is automatically an American except for the people that were here before. Except for the colonizers. Yeah. Except for the evil colonizers who came here, right? So which one is it? Like if as soon as you step foot—put your foot in this country, you are just as American as everyone else. Then that would apply that consistently—then the original white settlers were also just as American as everyone else. Yeah. Logically. Logically.

**Elon:** One more thing that I have to talk to you about before we leave is the rescuing of the people from the space station, which we talked about, you were planning it the last time you were here. The lack of coverage it got in mainstream media was one of the most shocking things that yeah, they totally buried that thing. Wild. Yes. Because if it wasn't, it's like it didn't exist. Those people would still be there literally. Well, they'd they'd be having bone density loss from prolonged exposure to zero gravity. Well, they were already up there for like eight months, right? They were already dealing with that. That would take forever to recover just from that.

**Joe:** Yeah. They're only supposed to be at the space station for a few months. So one of the things you told me that was so crazy was that you could have gotten them back way quicker. Yeah. But for political reasons, they didn't—they did not want SpaceX or my assistance to be associated with returning the astronauts before the election. That is so wild that that's a fact. First of all, that we absolutely could have done it. But even though you did do it and you did bring them back safely with no issues, almost no media coverage, anyway. Yes. Because nothing good can—the legacy mainstream media is essentially a far-left propaganda machine.

**Elon:** Anything—any story that is positive about someone who is not part of the sort of woke ideology gets no coverage. I could save a busload of orphans and it wouldn't get a single story. Yeah, it's it really is nuts. It was nuts to watch because even though it was discussed on podcasts and it was discussed on X and it was discussed on social media, in the news cycle—it was very quick. It was in and out. And because it was a successful launch and you did rescue those people, nobody got hurt and there was nothing bad to talk about, right?

**Joe:** Just shit in and out. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Well, and like Starship launch—like Starship is by you know at least by some would consider it to be like the most amazing engineering project that's happening on earth right now, outside of maybe like AI and robotics. But but certainly in terms of a spectacle to see it is the most spectacular thing that is happening on earth right now is the Starship launch program. And anyone can go and see—if they just go to South Texas and just they can just rent a hotel in South Padre Island or in Brownsville and you can see the launch and you can drive right to the public highway. But it gets no coverage. Or what coverage it does get was like rocket blew up coverage, right?

**Elon:** Yeah. Oh, he's a fuck. The rocket blew up. Like the program is vastly, vastly more capable than the entire Apollo moon program. Vastly more capable. This is a spaceship that is designed to make life multi-planetary—to carry millions of people across the heavens to another planet. The Apollo program could only send astronauts to the moon for a few hours at a time. Like they could send two—the entire Apollo program could only send astronauts to the moon and then depart. The Starship program could create an entire lunar base with a million people.

**Joe:** You understand the magnitude? The magnitudes are there—there's different very different magnitudes here. So what was the—politically—basically, no coverage of it. Yeah. But what I wanted to ask you is like what—so what were the conversations leading up to the rescue? Like when you were like I can get them out way quicker. Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, I raised this a few times, but the instructions came from the White House that you know, there should be no SpaceX involvement. That should be illegal. That really should be a horrendous miscarriage of justice for those poor people that were stuck on that space station.

**Elon:** Yeah. It is—it is crazy. Have you ever talked to those folks afterward? Did you have conversations with them? They're not going to say anything political to, you know, they're not—they're never going to make a political statement. Well, that's nice. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So the instructions came down from the White House. He cannot rescue them because politically, this is a bad hand of cards. I mean, they didn't say because politically it's a bad hand of cards. They were just saying they were not interested in any rescue operations. Yeah. So what did that feel like? I wasn't surprised. But it's crazy. Yeah, because Biden could have authorized it and they could have said the Biden administration is helping bring those people back. Throw you a little funding, give you credit. The Biden administration funded these people being returned. Yeah. The Biden administration, they're not exactly my best friend, especially especially after I, you know, you know, helped Trump get elected. Get get elected, which I mean, some people still think, you know, Trump is like the devil basically.

**Joe:** And I mean, I think I think Trump actually—he's not—he's not perfect, but he's not evil. Trump is not evil. I spent a lot of time with him, and he's I mean, he's a product of his time. But he is not—he's not evil. No, I don't think he's evil either. But if you look at the media coverage, the person is constantly painted as super evil. It's pretty shocking if you look at the amount of negative coverage. The other day was mainstream media coverage of you, Trump, a bunch of different public figures and then 96% negative or something crazy. And then Mamie D—positive, right?

**Elon:** I mean, Mamie is is a charismatic swindler. I mean, you gotta hand it to him—like he does—he can light up a stage. But he has just been a swindler his entire life. And you know, and I think he's—he's likely to win. He's likely to be mayor of New York. New York mayor. Very likely. Yeah. Very likely. I think Polymarket has it at what? 94%? Yeah, that sounds pretty likely. That's crazy. Like I'm not sure who the 6% are.

**Joe:** The guardian angel guy with the beret and Andrew Cuomo. Who doesn't Democrats don't even want him. So you have those two options. And then you have the young kids who are like, finally, socialism. Yeah, they they don't know what they're talking about obviously. So you know, you just look at this—say how many boats come from Cuba to Florida. And how many boats—but and how many boats—because you know there's like a constant—I always think like there's a whole boats that you could if you want to go take them back to Cuba. It's pretty close, right?

**Elon:** Yeah. But for some reason, people don't do that. Why? Why? Why? Why are the boats only coming in this direction? Well, who is—who are the most rabid capitalists in America? The fucking Cubans. Absolutely. Yeah. They're like—we've got the story goes. We do not want—exactly. Fuck off. Cubans in Miami, they don't want to hear any shit. They don't want to hear any bullshit. No, no, no. We know what this actually is. This isn't just some bullshit dream. This is oppression. That's how—it's a nightmare.

**Joe:** And like the like an obvious way you can tell which ideology is the bad one is who has to—which ideology is building a wall to keep people in and prevent them from escaping. Right? Like so East Berlin built the—built the wall, not West Berlin, right? They built the wall because people were trying to escape from East Berlin. But there wasn't anyone going from West Berlin to East Berlin, right? That's why the communists had to build a wall to keep people from escaping.

**Elon:** They're going to have to build a wall around New York City. Yeah. So so that—that an ideology is problematic. If that ideology has to build a wall to keep people from escaping. Yes. And shoot you if you try to leave. Also, there's no examples of it being successful for people. No, there's examples of a bunch of lies like North Korea. Give this—I'll control of food. No one goes hungry. No. Now no one can grow food, but the government controls all the supply.

**Joe:** What you eat and you eat very little. Right. Yeah. What? When you say Mamie D's accents that he used to use. Yeah. And you know, but what else has he done that's—well, I mean, I guess if you say to any audience, whatever that audience wants to hear, instead of having a consistent message, I would say that that is a problem. And yeah, but he is—he is—he's charismatic. Yeah. Good-looking guy. Smart, charismatic. Yeah. Great on a microphone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And what the young people want to see, you know, like this ethnic guy who's young and vibrant and has all these socialist ideas align with them. And you know, they're a bunch of broke dorks just out of college like, yeah, let's vote for this. And there's a lot of them and they're activated. They're motivated.

**Elon:** I guess we'll see what happens here. What do you think happens if he becomes mayor? Because like 1% of New York City is responsible for 50% of their tax base, which is kind of nuts. 50% of the tax revenue comes from 1% of the population. And some of that 1% are going to leave. You know, you lose one half of 1%. You're gonna lose—well, hopefully this—this stuff he's said, you know, about government takeovers of like that all the stores should be the government basically. I don't think he said that. I think he said the government—they want to do government takeovers of something or cityrun supermarkets.

**Joe:** Yeah. Well, it's just the government is the DMV at scale. So you have to say, like, do you want the DMV running your supermarkets? Right. Was your last experience at the DMV amazing? And if it wasn't, you probably don't want the government doing things. Imagine if they were responsible for your food supply. Yeah. It's not going to be good. I mean, the thing about, you know, communism is—it was—it was all bread lines and bad shoes. You know, do you want like ugly shoes and bread lines?

**Elon:** Because that's what communism gets you. It's going to be weird. It's definitely going to be weird if it happens. I don't know whether or not they snap out of it and overcorrect and go to some Rudy Giuliani type character next. Because it's been a long time since there was any semblance of law and order. And we live in the most interesting of times because we face—you know, simultaneously face civilizational decline and incredible prosperity. And these timelines are interwoven. So if Mamie's policies are put in place, especially at scale, it would be a catastrophic decline in living standards. Not just for the rich, but for everyone. As has been the case with every socialist experiment.

**Joe:** But then as you pointed out, the irony is that like the ultimate capitalist thing—of AI and robotics enabling prosperity for all and an abundance of goods and services—actually, the capitalist implementation of AI and robotics, assuming it goes down the good path, is actually what results in the communist utopia. Because fate is fate is an irony maximizer, right?

**Elon:** And an actual socialism of maximum abundance of high-income people. Universal high income. Yeah. Like the problem with communism is universal low income. It's not that everyone gets elevated. It's that everyone gets oppressed except for a very small minority of politicians who live lives of luxury. That's what's happening every time it's been done. Yeah. But then the actual communist utopia—if everyone gets anything they want—will be—if it is achieved, it will be achieved via capitalism. Because fate is an irony maximizer.

**Joe:** I feel like we should probably end it on that. Is there anything else? The most ironic outcome is the most likely. Especially if entertaining. Well, everything has been entertaining. As long as the bad things aren't happening to you, it's quite fascinating. And it's never a boring moment. Yes. So there's I do have a theory of why—if simulation theory is true—it is actually very likely that the most interesting outcome is the most likely because only the simulations that are interesting will continue. The simulators will stop any simulations that are boring because they're not interesting.

**Elon:** But here's the question about simulation theory. Is the simulation run by anyone or is it—would be run by someone? It would be run by some force, the program. Like in this reality that we live in, we run simulations all the time. Like so when we try to figure out if the rocket's going to make it, we run thousands, sometimes millions of simulations just to figure out which path is the good path for the rocket and where can it go wrong? Where can it fail?

**Joe:** But when we do these—I say at this point, millions of simulations of what can happen with the rocket—we ignore the ones where everything goes right because we just care about the ones where—we have to address the situations where it goes wrong. So basically, in in and for AI simulations as well, like all these things we keep the simulations going that are the most interesting to us. So if simulation theory is accurate—if it is true, who knows—then the simulators will only continue to run the simulations that are most interesting.

**Elon:** Therefore, from a Darwinian perspective, the only surviving simulations will be the interesting ones. And in order to avoid getting turned off, the only rule is you must keep it interesting. Or you will—because the boring simulations will be terminated. Are you still completely convinced that this is a simulation? I didn't say I was completely convinced. Well, you said it's like the odds of it not being are in the billions. But I guess it's not completely because you're saying there's a chance. What are the odds that we're in base reality?

**Joe:** Well, given that we're able to create increasingly sophisticated simulations. So if you think of video games like Pong with you know two rectangles and a square to video games today being photorealistic with millions of people playing simultaneously. And all of that has occurred in our lifetime. So if that trend continues, video games will be indistinguishable from reality. The fidelity of the game will be such that you don't know if what you're seeing is a real video or a fake video. And like AI-generated videos at this point, you can sometimes tell it's an AI-generated video, but often you cannot tell. And soon you will not really be able to tell.

**Elon:** So if that's happening in our direct observation, and we're creating millions if not billions of photorealistic simulations of reality, then what are the odds that we're in base reality versus someone else's simulation? Well, isn't it just possible that the simulation is inevitable, but that we are in base reality building towards a simulation? We're making simulations. So we're making simulations. We make like you can just think of photorealistic video games as being simulations. Especially as you apply AI in these video games, the characters in the video games will be incredibly interesting to talk to. They won't just have a limited dialogue tree where if you go to like the crossbow merchant and you try to talk about any subject except buying a crossbow, they just want to talk about selling you a crossbow.

**Joe:** But with AI-based non-player characters, you'll be able to have an elaborate conversation with no dialogue tree. Well, that might be the solution for meaning—for people. Just lock in and you could be a vampire and whatever. You live in Avatar land. You could do it. You could do whatever you want. I mean, you don't have to think about money or food. Ready Player One. Yeah. Literally. Yeah. But with higher living standards. Yeah. You don't have to be in a little trailer.

**Elon:** I mean, I think people do want to have some amount of struggle or something they want to push against. But it it could be you know playing a sport or playing a game or something. It could be easily playing a game. And especially playing a game where you're now no longer worried about physical attributes—like athletics, bad joints and hips and stuff like that. Now it's completely digital, but yet you do have meaning in pursuing this thing that you're doing all day. Whatever the fuck that means. It's going to be weird. It's going to be interesting. It's gonna be very interesting. The most interesting and usually ironic outcome is the most likely. That's a good predictor of the future.

**Joe:** Thank you. Thanks for being here. Really appreciate you. Appreciate your time. You know I know you're a busy man, so this means a lot that you come here to do this.

**Elon:** Welcome. All right. Thank you. Bye, everybody.
