879 views  Oct 31, 2025
The visual effects behind The Matrix weren't just movie magic, they were the foundation for today's AI revolution. John Gaeta, the Oscar-winning VFX supervisor who created bullet time, reveals how the 1999 film laid the groundwork for AI filmmaking tools. And how photogrammetry, universal capture, and real-time rendering went from impossible movie techniques to the technology powering your favorite games, AI tools, and virtual productions.

In this conversation:
How Matrix VFX techniques became the prototypes for AI filmmaking tools, game engines, and AR/VR systems
How The Matrix team sourced PhD thesis films from university labs to invent new 3D capture techniques
Why "universal capture" from Matrix 2 & 3 was the precursor to modern volumetric video and 3D avatars
The Matrix 4 experiments with Unreal Engine that almost launched a transmedia universe based on The Animatrix
Why dystopian sci-fi becomes infrastructure (and what that means for AI safety)
Where John is building next: Escape.art and the future of interactive storytelling

Intro: The Matrix's 25-Year Secret Plan
0:00
Everyone remembers Neo dodging bullets, but the real story of the Matrix isn't what you saw on screen. It's what they
0:07
were building behind the scenes. They weren't just making a movie. They were creating the tools that would one day
0:12
lead to the AI and 3D revolution we see today with tools like Genie 3 and Unreal Engine. And the crazy part, this was all
0:19
planned 25 years ago. Today we have the architect to that vision, Shawn Gada,
0:25
the visual effects mastermind behind The Matrix, to explain how a sci-fi blockbuster secretly laid the groundwork
0:31
for our AI future. The Matrix was a cautionary tale. We don't want to end up being enslaved by
0:37
these wondrous, remarkable, and occasionally potentially dangerous systems that we're inventing here.
0:44
[Music] Let's rewind and go back in time. The
0:49
Matrix trilogy didn't just employ visual effects, it redefined them. Starting with bullet time. John Gada was asking a
0:56
deeper question. What does it take to simulate reality? Those questions didn't just change cinema, it changed how we
1:03
build worlds. We were working on the very, very first one years before the first one. Any of you guys saw that,
Solving the "God's Eye" Problem
1:09
right? So, we were confronted with conceptual premises that needed to sort
1:14
of match up with the idea of the film, right? That at some point story could take place in a flawless simulation. And
1:22
the goals of that in movie making terms, let's say this is the early 90s, early
1:27
to mid '90s. Imagine, you know, we're only so many years down from the vector
1:33
graphics introduction of Tron, right? And it's really not that much time in
1:38
the longer scheme of things. So there were really small building blocks that were available to think about at that
1:45
time. But the main idea was like how do we essentially believe that these these
1:51
characters are in this simulation? And so traditional what usually begins in
1:57
oldtimey Hollywood is you think about oh what illusion can you create? You know how do you hack this the idea of this so
2:03
that the audience believes it? But it was different back then for me because the Wakowskis gave incredible license to
2:11
us to attempt some early early approaches that I guess in these days would probably never have been allowed
2:17
to happen because the risk involved was was really too high. We're living in a very risk averse version of Hollywood
2:24
now. So essentially what we tried to do is we tried to figure out okay well firstly in any simulation would comprise
2:32
sources of reality the real world and essentially some kind of delivery system
2:37
that allowed the user participant to have limitless ability to navigate. So
2:43
essentially God's eye power among so many other powers. So we're like okay how do we get God's eye power on the
2:49
screen? How do we imply that? And so it just the hack of the first film which was very different than the way we did
2:55
the second and third was okay how do we feel like we can have omniresent perspective how do we do that and so
3:02
that led to just there's no physical way to uh cheat time and space shooting with
3:07
old cameras regular cameras we're going to need to put a camera everywhere where perspective needed to be and that
3:13
essentially was a hack it's a full hack but I think this is interesting right so this is the 120 camera like still camera
Recruiting PhD Students to Invent Bullet Time
3:19
rig that y'all essentially built to do do that iconic bullet time shot. And then is it true that all the there were
3:24
certain background sequences where these are some of the first, you know, instantiations of photoggramometry or
3:30
reality capture on the silver screen. How did that go about? Did you go to like Sigraph and find a wild Paul Debec
3:37
and see his like you know PhD thesis film or like how did how did all of that come about? The problem at that time was
3:44
it had to be divided between what you could do in the foreground with the actors and what everything else was. And
3:50
we still, you know, had options like photographing things as panoramics as or
3:56
with motion control systems, robotic camera systems. But at that time, my colleagues, they were leading edge
4:02
thinkers in graphics were hearing about some other research going on in universities. So at that time we looked
4:08
around the world at experiments in universities and other things because so these ideas you know they're not
4:15
necessarily lightning strikes in a bottle. They're usually there are people around the world right that are starting
4:21
to put some things together and starting to put together um you know experiments
4:27
and uh media labs of a kind I guess early stage computer graphics labs you
4:33
know is where you might find some of this. So yeah, we found uh a number of let's call it like uh PhD students and
4:40
uh you know Paul Debick over in Berkeley was close in the neighborhood and so we
4:46
were looking at uh some of his work. Yes, they were thesis films right that he was putting together and that was a
4:52
start point at least with our relationship with Paul and his amazing students who wound up becoming you know
4:58
very accomplished in their own right across the years. That was our first thought right was to essentially move
5:04
towards an image-based rendering approach. First time it was experimented with for movies I think uh amongst other
5:11
things in in those days. So those that was the foreground and the background plan and uh yeah over time that that got
5:18
deeper. Okay, I can't stress this enough. This was not a stunt. It was a shift in capturing reality. A new
5:24
language of perception where you can capture the dynamic physical world in all its glory. And they did it in a way
5:30
that just hadn't been done before. First Matrix, especially when they were making it. This is like right around Jurassic
5:36
Park, right? So, this is perhaps the first time people had seen like a CG dino, like a CG character. But y'all
5:42
didn't stop there with the Matrix, right? Matrix 2 and three then pushed a bunch of other boundaries. What was that
5:47
experience like when you finished the first Matrix? You unlocked a whole new category of shots, shall we say, a whole
5:53
new category of visual effects, and then you got two more ahead of you. Were you like, "Ah, we got to keep pushing
5:58
further." Was it always in your mind that the Matrix film was sort of like a prototype for what we'll be able to
6:05
achieve practically in the future with real technologies? What I would say here is that there is
6:10
this relationship between writing intellectual thinking, science fiction, I guess you could say, for various uh
How Sci-Fi Becomes a Roadmap for Reality
6:18
entertainment media. But it's that the imagining of dreams if you will right of
6:24
people of humans that I think are the first bit of catalyst that can trigger
6:29
essentially like the actualization right of the ideas in the hands of engineers brilliant engineers inventors these days
6:37
could be AI right that sort of manifest these things but the it almost becomes like a road map or
6:43
prototype that builders can look at that is right and so this idea of kind of mind over matter, mind over matrix.
6:50
At least this ability to have power unmatched by any physical limit, right,
6:56
that we have in the real world, right? This attractiveness that the Wakowskis sort of had figured out, right? Like how
7:02
to create some kind of like fantasy fulfillment, you know what I mean? If you dream about being in a comic book,
7:09
right? All these things. And but that the one of the things that virtuality and simulation and all of that could
7:15
potentially give us is this sort of feeling of limitlessness, right? Yeah. We were of course in the movie business
7:21
back then, but we were also incredibly compelled and stimulated by the actual
7:26
premise of what was going on in the story that we were working on in a very unusual way, right? Like not just like,
7:32
hey, this is a gig. We're going to we're going to be these service people that are going to figure out how to do the
7:37
standard hack and illusion, make a shot if you like to problem solve. You know, visual effects is a wonderful place to
7:43
go and you know and to try to do that. But but this was a lot more for us and it actually started putting the whole
7:50
cabal of collaborators kind of on this path on this road map. We would walk that for decades at that point, right?
Matrix 2/3: Inventing "Universal Capture"
7:57
Because not only us were like lit up by the ideas, but like all sorts of people
8:02
that saw the films right around the world literally thinking about little
8:08
building blocks of the in in their own way. When we got to the next two films, you know, we were thinking, okay, well,
8:15
we want to get a lot more ambitious with this idea, right? We started to taste the beginning of uh a way to essentially
8:23
universally capture which we we called it universal capture. We we we were just starting to dip our toes in the water of
8:29
how to capture reality. Of course, there are so many limits compared to what we're walking towards now, right? At the
8:36
moment, at that time, it was essentially creating a sculpture, right? It was like a it was sort of a capture of a a moment
8:43
in time and everything else that you needed to do to make it appear to be alive and dynamic, right? Because a
8:50
movie is a a movie is a sculpture. It's it's not like a you know, a simulation. And so uh so we were focusing on okay
8:57
what is the best sculpture and how do we you know do certain things to give you that sort of mind over matrix feeling.
9:03
So that came mostly with the virtual cinematography, the camera work and all that to give you that feeling, you know,
9:09
in the first movie putting a camera in nearly every frame uh with the exception
9:14
of uh state-of-the-art interpolation which never had occurred before at that time. But the sequels for the Matrix, I
9:20
mean essentially we wanted to level up. So we at that point we jettisoned all the stills and we replaced them with the
9:29
you know five only known existing highdeaf cameras in the world which George George Lucas had three of them
9:35
made you know pan vision made the others so these stitched together heads and bodies they were just prototypes early
9:42
versions of metahumans that you see today in high-end video games and all the digital doubles that you see in
Matrix 4: Stepping Inside the "Real" Matrix
9:47
Hollywood that experience like where you know for Matrix Resurrections y'all worked on The
9:53
Matrix Awakens, this game that was tightly coupled to the release of the movie, made entirely in Unreal Engine
9:59
with your friend Kim. And heck, it's funny. It's like, and then you all like kind of open sourced all the assets for
10:05
it. Heck, I've made a viral Tik Tok set in that fake amalgamation of New York,
10:10
LA, what have you, which of course is an asset that I would have never modeled from scratch myself, but now that's like
10:16
a public common asset that people can use. So, it's perhaps a crude instantiation of other people going
10:22
inside the world and telling their own stories, but what the hell was that whole experience like to go from making
10:27
visual effects for the Matrix to making a real time rendition like a real-time instantiation of the construct?
10:34
That's a it's a good question. I mean the old posi you know from the film making days they were I mean a lot of my
10:42
colleagues were restless you know and they did not really want to spend that
10:48
much time gigging for big studios um like a machine you know like being part
10:54
of their machine I wasn't really as interested in that I of course we like storytelling but like
11:00
not the conveyor belt of new movie 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Yeah you can separate ate these
11:05
things in terms of like the the experience of the story uh and all that we had with that but then you can just
11:12
step outside and say uh walking through the years of the Hollywood you know complex and all that it's become so my
11:19
friends you know started wandering into like uh AAA gaming wanting wanting to
11:24
sort of build worlds that didn't stop at the end of a movie they wanted to build persistent worlds you know everyone like
11:30
gaming per se so they wanted to work in that area as well because it was very exciting training across these two
11:36
decades moving towards AAA and all sorts of remarkable things. Others wandered
11:41
into the into labs in Silicon Valley, you know, uh media labs that spend a
11:46
decade before we've even seen half the things that actually are in our hands now. Uh but but there's been
11:51
experimentation, right? And to me, I was like, I quickly realized that uh the things that visual effects and science
11:58
fiction seen in movies that inspired in labs that we've never that most of us never get a chance to see. You maybe
12:04
have seen some of this, but like it's a move well beyond, right, just conjuring illusion, right, for you know, fixed
12:10
fixed shots in a movie. Anyway, to get back to the awakens thing. So, the thing that uh Kim and I didn't really expect
12:17
was that the another movie would even someone would think of making another one. you know, Lana decided she had a
12:23
sort of epiphany and wanted to tell another story. We were so down the road with other interests of ours in these
12:29
other media landscapes. At any rate, we were like not really ever going to do
12:34
visual effects again in that way, right? And but we still loved the whole family,
12:40
if you will, right? Uh that made the films. We were all together for years and we're like love to still really do
12:46
something and participate. So we started thinking about like okay what would we like to do this version of ourselves but
12:52
you know back in this universe and for me and for Kim we were mostly you know we're like well okay you know
12:58
considering that you know the in the first set of films we were trying to figure out how to approximate you know
13:04
uh primitive methods that might lead towards the ideas that the film was really about.
13:10
Yeah. Right. So we like kind of faking the construct if you will. Yeah. And we zoom for, you know, we're zooming two decades later and, you know,
13:17
Kim is literally reinventing graphics with Tim and the Unreal Engine, changing
13:23
everything to to such that like one could imagine, right? Playing inside of cinematic worlds, right? They they're
13:29
moving in this direction, right? I think that's because of a fusion and a convergence of different kinds of people
13:34
into that company, right? Fortnite. Imagine a day when the ideas of Fortnite
13:40
are sort of as well cinematically real. Take these steps, right, where you're like, "Oh, they're video games. Oh, we
13:47
can only go so far with the limit of serving real-time graphics to multi, you
13:52
know, hundred people, etc." Keep zooming down the line and eventually you end up at cinematic realism and all sorts of
14:00
things that you can do in a social play environment. When the Matrix Resurrection project came back, Kim and
14:07
I were like, well, what really would we want to do given what we did and what we were thinking? So, we're like, we want
14:13
to actually figure out a way to step inside the matrix, right, in the best way that we could, you know, circa 21 or
14:20
two. So, we're like, okay, well, it's also that's where my head went. And so with some other colleagues what we were
14:27
thinking okay well why don't we plot out other instantiations of experience and media that we could get inside right and
14:34
have so it was a much more ambitious than what actually ended up happening but what we're thinking is that like
Building a City-Scale Simulation in Unreal Engine 5
14:40
well why wouldn't you want to step inside and see story right perhaps in one form factor like bounded by editing
14:47
and feeling again passive and two-dimensional and then unlock that and explore and then play right and do
14:55
whatever have adventures inside the story world. So we thought okay we'll try to create a virtual backlot to use
15:01
that old time and again remember some of the like the Mandalorian like some of the people are also involved in in this
15:08
whole group that I was working with slightly adjacent to the movie. Yeah, they also before they left Lucasfilm set
15:15
up all of the the formula and elements of the mand the way they did the Mandalorian and triggered that whole
15:21
virtual production virtual backlot uh phase that has been going on. Anyway, same people, right? Like so old timey
15:28
Matrix Posi goes gets bored of movie business reinvents realism in AAA gaming
15:35
takes a couple of other side steps at changing the way that movies can even be
15:40
made with virtual production virtual backlot. Suddenly it was no longer about simulating a moment. It was about
15:46
stepping into a living world. The Matrix wasn't a movie. It became a medium and
15:52
opened the possibilities for the future and inspired countless many to come, including Kim Leiri, now the CTO of
15:59
Unreal Engine. So with Kim and I, we were like basically, okay, let's set up beautiful demonstration of possibilities, right?
16:07
Playing in a cinematic world. It wasn't really multi-user, but the implication was that it could be, right? But like
16:13
the the sort of absolutely mesmerizing possibilities of rendering graphics
16:18
inside of unlike anything anyone had ever seen before. I mean you could zoom down to a tiny little spot in the world
16:24
and sort of like fixate on it. And it was it was as close to photo realism as anything had achieved up to the time
16:31
and it was brimming with life, right? You had like traffic systems, you had people walking on the sidewalks. So they were like experimenting with all
16:37
kinds of procedural and and generative approaches. a lot of experimentation in there by that group, but it wasn't only
16:44
supposed to be a demo, right? So, we're like, okay, this is convenient. We'll build this thing and I'll we'll use this
The AI Animatrix Prequel Hollywood Killed
16:50
plus more to actually set up a new set of entertainment. So, I was working on
16:56
uh developing a new origin story actually that would come in through the
17:02
the banner of the Animatrix, right? So we were actually we were writing what we thought could be a series that would be
17:08
renewed version of the animatrix but we would use some of these backdrops that were that the epic people were working
17:15
on for for this purpose. People should demand that they that we go back into it
17:20
because to me I think it would be more interesting than anything but it was the setting of the story was more or less like 20 years from now 10 years from now
17:27
let's say even 10 years from now. So it's basically what we're all doing here, right? What we're talking about
17:33
here with about 10 years more maturity maybe, right? And that was basically the
17:39
precursor to the Matrix, right? This would be like the times, right? And it would be um a series in which the
17:46
construct was used to connect the times of Neo during a time when Neo was
17:52
essentially lost, right? There's a you know, he disappears off the scene for a while. So during this
17:59
time and Lana is a part of this storytelling, she's building up some of the formulaic pieces in this this
18:06
animatrix 2.0 matrix um prequel kind of thinking. And uh so basically during
18:12
this the times of when Neo is lost, they're trying to basically go back to the beginning even before the Matrix to
18:20
understand if there's some kind of clues there that would help them find where he
18:25
might have gone or be. Right? what kind of you know digital ether has he sort of
18:31
slipped into because they don't believe that he's really gone right they they they think that he's in some realm of
18:36
existence right that is uh not understandable at the time so the idea
18:42
would be to essentially use the construct to time travel in through simulation back to the pre-matrix time
18:50
which we were setting at about 10 years from now in terms of the real world like the trajectory that we're on
How Hollywood Kills Innovation
18:55
so you had the tech you had the story. What was the 20th century thinking that you ran up against?
19:01
In the 20th century, you needed to have a successful movie before you would ever
19:06
think of launching any other kind of media. And you would do nothing. It would sit on your hands or make anything
19:12
happen to try to converge, you know, fundamental pillars of your operation
19:18
that should be talking to each other. M for example, there is no reason I can think of why the original creators of
19:25
remarkable stories, usually in the form of scripts and movies, should not be the exact same people that are have their
19:32
hands into development of the interactive counterparts. Sure. Right. Like that that is really old
19:39
world thinking, right? We'll wait two or three years and then tap a group that had nothing to do
19:46
with the original origin of the universe to go and try to figure out how to capture that warm and it's why video
19:51
games related to movies have never worked before because they've isolated the groups and siloed and this is just
19:58
what the old paradigm has been. It doesn't mean that it can't be done in a really successful way. I mean Last of Us
20:04
was a phenomenal game and it's a phenomenal series. uh but it took how many like a decade or whatever. So my
20:12
hope is that we can get past that because technology has enabled us to
20:17
potentially think in parallel and produce in parallel. The only thing though that we still are up against is
20:23
this uh just draconian risk aversion that you know prevents that kind of
20:29
synergistic development and uh absolutely think that they'll be it'll be proven by this new wave of creators.
20:36
They can create not only stories but they can create interactive counterparts. They can they'll soon be
20:42
able to create autonomous character agents that are spun straight from their movies straight into some kind of play
20:49
sandbox. that stuff I think is is coming into into view. And um yeah, so uh but
20:58
it was it was kind of like what stopped what I thought was really like something
21:03
that was as authentic in spirit as it was in the first movies, right? Like the
21:09
things that we were starting to try to, you know, incubate there could have been phenomenal. I mean like just basically
21:15
this west in a way it's a very westworldly kind of thinking process like step inside that story interact see
21:21
the sculpture if you want but then wander off see it you know in different formats this one's this one's aa gaming
21:29
kind of vibe you know or social gaming vibe this one is an immersive vibe but they're all basically hub back to the
21:35
same foundational which is what the way we were thinking about it with Unreal at the time is like well we'll use this
21:41
right this is going to be a multimodal media engine, right? That's going to and based on what
21:48
kind of experience you want. In other words, the Matrix didn't just stay a movie. It became something you could experience. Stories are turning
21:55
into these living, playable worlds, and we're a part of them, not just passive spectators.
Gen AI: A New "Golden Age for Expression"
22:03
Fast forwarding to today, AI is flipping the creative process upside down. You've got all these generative tools like
22:09
Google's V3, Sora 2, Runway, and they let anyone build cinematic stories. But
22:14
the question remains, where does all of this lead? The advent of Genai as a filmm tool is
22:21
really going to cause a big bang of original storytelling on a scale we've
22:26
never seen before. And I can only think that that is a huge positive, you know,
22:32
development. I mean, I think that we're heading into a diff a new version of a golden age, you know, for storytelling,
22:39
you know, I don't know if it's a golden age of Hollywood, but it's a new golden age, right, for for expression. And uh,
22:46
of course, you know, I'm not saying that a virtual sea, rising sea of new content
22:52
will make will be good. There'll be all sorts of things, but but from that there'll be just a remarkable, you know,
22:59
sort of new huge uh uh spectrum of creative voices and
23:04
stories and and worlds, you know, that need to be, you know, found by audiences of all kinds. I'm excited by it. I'm
23:11
like completely excited by it. And I would look at the next, you know, couple few years as really a foundational time
23:18
for whatever we do beyond that. It's going to there's a new foundation being laid out. And I think that creators or
23:26
people who are creative, I mean, there's nothing more, let's say, fulfilling at
23:31
the deepest level than being able to achieve making something like actually getting, you know, your story told or
23:37
get some piece of content made. It changes you inside, right? Like if you're able to do it like in the old
23:44
days working on movies or or series or whatever, these are or games. I mean these are multi-year battles to get to
23:52
the other side like okay you got a dream you know you've got your dream on paper you know typed out digital you've
23:58
drawing things right to get all the way across you know to the completion the
24:05
moment of completion it takes all that a person has and you know whether they're professional or you know they're just
24:11
doing it out of passion and uh you know because it's complicated it's it's really really not simple right to make
24:17
any You could be making a short film as a student and this is a huge endeavor. It's a huge lift, right? So the fact
24:24
that Gen AI is going to enable people to get to the other side faster because
24:30
what they're making essentially is, you know, they're expressing something. They're, you know, they're creating a
24:35
world out of nothing to get to the other side. Being able to do that, I mean, okay, that changes a person inside the
24:41
creator. Not only do they give birth to it, but they're also doing something for themselves. And then now you know the
24:47
ability to do that and iterate so rapidly means that I mean again I'll go
24:52
back to the old paradigm theurs the masters that we've seen in film television game right each time they
25:00
make a new work I mean they become ever more masterful right they just learn so
25:05
much more every single time it causes huge evolution to them as creators but
25:10
also you know to the art form okay movies you know always advancing television Everything is always
25:16
advancing each time these creators get an iteration out, right?
25:21
So, you know, the Gen AI, okay, yes, it's not perfect now, right? There's
25:26
lots to be uh thought through, but the pace of iteration, right, is
25:32
like a hyper acceleration of the individual too, the human author.
25:38
Sure. Right. They're they're moving towards they're they're starting out already amplified. they're going to end up super
25:45
amplified. And so I just think not only is it interesting that we've unlocked we're going to unlock millions if not
25:52
billions of voices that have been constrained, but from even that we're going to see some really very
25:59
interesting talent rise out of that. Power to iterate is one thing that means you can keep, you know, putting things
26:05
out there. In a sense, this is beyond efficiency. Oh, I can just do more visual effects with less time and a smaller team. It's
AI Isn't Efficiency, It's "Permission"
26:12
really about permission. Suddenly, you can bypass all the gatekeepers and turn your vision into reality.
26:18
Despite those milestones I've been blessed to cross through with friends and colleagues, it is so complex and
26:26
difficult to actually get back and resourced to be able to do those sorts of things where it has been up to this
26:32
time, right? to have real autonomy and to be able to not have to abide by a
26:39
labyrinth of rules, restrictions, whether it's brand based autocracy,
26:44
right? Brand autocracy, corporate autocracy, right? But what you have to
26:49
do, what a creator has to do to get the resource right to do those things up to this point has really broken and been
26:57
the best and brightest creators regardless of where there this is not a indie creator problem. This is not like
27:03
a hey I'm going to try to make it. No, that's not that. You can take this problem, you can talk about this problem
27:09
all the way up to Martin Scorsesei, right? Or anybody you can think of, right? The creator creators of the
27:15
greatest games of our times, right? You can like what individuals have had to do to try to be able to get their authentic
27:22
vision out has been incredibly painful. And it's not there isn't a productive
27:28
relationship one can have with producers because the constraints are not saying that all constraints are bad. Some
27:34
constraints really allow you to refine and make the best of all things, right?
27:39
Because you some constraints really make you think harder and the problem solving makes the product be better, right? But
27:46
as you you triage things that are not as good. I'm not talking about that. I'm mostly talking about gatekeeping, right?
27:53
So, I thought after all these years of trying to work on my own projects, I'm like, "Okay, I've I've got so many
27:58
friends and colleagues with immense talent that should be like commanding huge fan bases and having successful
A New Platform Bypassing Gatekeepers
28:05
careers that just couldn't get backed by these gatekeepers." What I thought I would do is I would set up a platform
28:10
that was on its face, it looked very familiar, right? Almost like Netflix or something.
28:16
Yeah, it looks like a Netflix or an HBO. looks like a prestigelike streamer, but
28:22
in fact, it's filled with radical entertainment. It's filled with people who are pushing limits that don't really
28:28
have any opportunity to push up. It's very they're going to go into the grinder, right, and walk the coals to if
28:35
they're going to ever get there. Right. Right. Maybe they'll get there through uh, you know, a whole bunch of convoluted things
28:40
that they'll go through and lose their shirts and lose control of their IP and all of the standard stuff that all the
28:46
creators know about. Right. Right. No matter who you are, it's like yes, this process of being
28:53
ground up, right? Losing control, truly selling your soul to make something. Yeah. You sell you sell your soul and
28:58
then you got you get your pennies and you make your thing and maybe everybody, you know, if you're lucky, it gets through and that's great, but most
29:06
people have a hard time with that. The other side of the coin is just trying to get discovered again, right, in a sea of
29:13
media blips that like, you know, that large social platforms. I'm not against them. I I like that they let anybody in.
29:19
I mean, I think that's great, but to get discovered means again bending yourself to algorithms, doing all sorts of crazy
29:26
things, you know, and then again being also warped by like having to, you know,
29:32
sell or do things in order to even get funded for that. So there's Right. This amazing piece of art brought
29:38
to you by World of Tanks. Exactly. Yeah. So, which is not a bad game actually, but
29:44
the thing is the thing is is that like uh I mean, and I'm not trying to sound utopian or over idealistic, but like I
29:51
thought it would be great to have a platform where uh you know, you could see just original things, right? And I'm
29:57
interested not I don't I don't really care about the I do care but I don't
30:03
have the bandwidth to think about the problems of the movie and entertainment business or the visual effects business
30:10
and all of the sort of uh pressure and anxiety to do things cheaper, faster, bigger, right? That are
30:16
crushing in on everybody. um and and causing near systemic
30:21
breakdown like a seizure. not just visual effects but all across all across
30:26
entertainment is is suffering a seizure due due to this risk aversion and at the
30:32
same time you have geni coming and like is that a threat or is that basically empowerment right and so what I would
30:39
like to see is the empowerment end of the equation manifest somewhere oh here
30:44
a person a bright person that hasn't been able to get you know a chance in a
30:50
break it could be even a very established person who's got a stack of scripts collecting dust that are
30:56
fantastic and they're just nowhere, right? Because they're just being rejected. That person needs a venue,
31:02
right? And you know, you could put on YouTube, you could try to walk the coals, but you could also, you know, get
31:08
it on Escape, right? And uh at least have a place where it's a respectful,
31:13
beautiful presentation of this thing you made. And so we're trying to build up everybody on escape is actually invited.
31:20
It's curated, right? We c curate people not media. So it's like oh interesting person you should have a channel. We
31:26
know that you're gonna fill this channel with interesting things and then we will through a program we will programming we
31:32
will you know surface surface things and curate and uh yeah and so we call it neo
31:37
cinema because there's a lot of people not just geni people there's people use game engines people use use really
31:42
unusual forms of capture. It's neo cinema. It's new cinema. It's like whatever emergent enabling technology
31:50
you needed to get right these stories told. And then we will be opening up an interactive branch also this year in 25.
31:58
Yeah. Very exciting. Later in the year. Oo, that's super exciting. Yeah. So, it's like it is it has the best elements
32:03
of kind of what Vimeo used to do in the early days, creating really interesting pieces of content that may never have
32:09
made it through like sort of the YouTube al algorithmic gauntlet. But at the same time, yeah, your focus on creators and
32:15
like I know a bunch of the creators that are on your platform are literally at the bleeding edge of generative AI, of
32:21
like real time film making, all this different stuff. Now, it may be correct to say if bullet time or universal
32:27
capture broke the notion of space and time. Escape breaks the mold entirely. It puts the tools and distribution in
32:34
your hands. You don't need to pitch to a gatekeeper. You just publish a world and cater to your own audience.
32:43
All right. So, we've got all these tools, but what comes next? John isn't just dreaming the future. He's building it, and he's got an opinion on it. A
32:49
future where AI, gaming, and movies all come together in this unique experience
32:54
that impacts both creation and consumption. Massive social media platform side.
33:00
The problem is discovery, right? It's sort of like I'm in a little rowboat and I'm on literally on the ocean, right?
33:06
Trying to like a tsunami even. where is, you know, where are the things of value that I need, right? I think we're going to
33:13
replace the uh really clunky, you know, ill-working recommendation systems with
33:19
very very powerful systems that can help us find things. I always thought that
33:25
curation is really the the inevitable way to find things in that ocean. It's
33:32
curation through trust, right? Like if I trust the curator because the curator has demonstrated that we have
33:38
like-mindedness, right? I'm aligned, right, to their taste, then I'm going to
33:43
find more and more things of value through that curation. The question is, can you find your way to that the right
33:49
curator, right? Or can you just find your way to the content because you've got some onboard six sense to find that
33:56
stuff? intelligent curator is just one answer for the question of what do you do when we're flooded with a sea a sea
34:03
of media you know made by all those newly enabled voices okay great I'm glad
34:08
everyone's enabled everyone right but I still now need to figure out right what's going to something that could I
34:15
resonate with me and this is very true right like yeah the the volume and velocity which books
34:21
are being authored movies TV shows music just every modality you can think of
34:26
there's just way more of it there ever has been. And you're seeing people react in two fashions. One is like what has
34:32
stood the test of time to your point about, you know, like the greats, you know, whatever their art form might be.
34:38
They've kind of stood that like people are still reading Shakespeare, right? Like or some modern instantiation of Shakespeare or whatever. That's one
34:44
thing. It's like go back to basics. Go back to the stuff that was relevant a decade ago. Then on the other hand is
34:50
like novel for forms of kind of yeah like curation essentially finding some of this content whether it's on you know
34:56
X or LinkedIn or YouTube and u you know experiencing it like um but don't you
35:02
think this is inherently the deck is stacked against you know the the favor of creatives because the volume of
35:09
creation is only going to go up and the number of people are you know going to grow at a steady clip but we only have
35:14
24 hours in a day and as much as the social media industrial complex is going to try and make sure that we spend even
35:21
more. So yeah, I mean there is definitely an emerging tech entertainment complex
35:26
coming. Yeah. And it is maybe going to be an unfortunate moment in the future when
The Future: AI Agents as Your Sixth Sense
35:32
the tech monoliths put the entertainment mini monoliths in their back pocket, you
35:37
know, and but they will at some point and then we're serving a new master. But what I personally think that I need to
35:43
be equipped with is a some form of agent that is in fact my sixth sense that is
35:48
bonded to me that has the ability to peer into the invisible vast you know
35:55
bases of the internet and all other uh sort of realms. What I really want is a
36:01
an unconnected a sovereign agent that is truly agent bonded to me, right? That has just
36:06
uh incredible uh insights as to what's surrounding and also able to advise me,
36:13
keep me safe, right? Find find things that are only going to benefit me, be of value to me across like all sorts of
36:20
categories. Now, how crazy is this? the technology that the first Matrix predicted. By the
36:26
time the fourth one came around, you could actually instantiate a matrix of your own. I'm really interested in the living
36:32
world thing, right? I want worlds to just be persistent. The funny thing about this stuff is like I mean, you
36:39
know, you've been it's like we've talked a lot about these concepts the last decade, maybe longer, right?
36:46
But we haven't really quite seen them right there at our fingertips, right, to frictionlessly uh experience. But
36:52
they're absolutely on on on route, right? Like so the idea that I could decide to tap into
37:00
a world that somebody has essentially provided some kind of DNA blueprint DNA
37:06
might not be the some formulaic blueprint. In this world, these things happen. You know what I mean?
37:12
And you know, here are the kinds of subgroups, you know, of character inhabitants, right? That you could meet
37:18
just like video game design, right? Yeah. Yeah. Like or the narrative division in Westworld, right? Like kind of that level of abstraction.
37:25
Yeah. And so you Yes. Exactly. And that's why like actually some people will do much better than this than
37:30
others. Some people just have brain, right? The instincts for how to world build, how to design
37:36
formula. Um and that may be as far as I mean you start there, right? And then
37:42
maybe once you know you've got the rules I guess inside that you could if you
37:48
chose to you could tell stories or carve your own story because you're walking through it in a way. So like Westworld's
37:54
good example like imagine you essentially design a Westworld like simulation that only appears if you have
38:02
mixed reality. I mean like if you really want to get deep inside like mix you know it's like okay we'll just use we'll just use AI we'll just use agents and
38:09
mixed reality and basically design something that runs like Westworld. The point being is that you were kind of
38:16
like bringing up the idea of where does the map where does the territory go in the future. We called it magic verse
38:23
doesn't matter what it is. It's just basically like we start layering in rules-based world scenarios and
38:29
situations on top of the map and then we start having interactions with characters in situations that may have
38:36
they're either only running along lines along the lines of the rules or maybe you know there is some kind of invisible
38:43
author right that's kind of conjuring up a scenario that you're walking into. At
38:48
any rate though like the experience you know is a story right so I the path that I walk through is the same as a
38:54
sculpture in my opinion like a movie is essentially a sculpture you walked along a path and there was a timeline and yes
39:02
it was sort of crafted by a particular person a director writer but there's no
39:07
reason why you couldn't you know expect that you know the paths walked by people
39:13
through the unstructured version of that world with that kind of dynamic wouldn't be compelling. They could be extremely
39:19
compelling. And so I do think that we we could potent, you know, you brought up like uh you know, whether you follow an
39:25
influencer, right? Like let's not use that word. Let's just say an engaged a very engaged person that wants to sort
39:32
of you know uh actually accomplish some goals or discover or explore something
39:38
right in the story world. So that could be depending on how interesting that person is and how they approach it,
39:43
right? Or them and their friends, right? Yeah, then that could be something very fun to watch and or you know even tag
39:50
along, right? You could imagine people tagging along. Um not if if it's in a
39:56
mixed reality sense, of course that's different, you know. Uh but um but I could absolutely see this happening in
40:02
like uh you know more like virtual depictions. So like yeah, it was based in the real world, but then it was
40:08
hybridized with this story stuff. Um and then uh we walk through the simulation like a video game. you know we you know
40:14
basically walk the path as if we were in a video game and that's an interesting story by the end by by the end right or
40:21
pieces of it right and we can share that like memories um it's not far out
40:27
fanciful imaginings I mean this is something that I think the technology
40:33
is close to beginning it's close to it's it's going to deliver on this in this
40:39
inside of this decade But if science fiction becomes modern
40:46
infrastructure, then power and danger do come with it. We're no longer just watching a movie. We're living inside
40:52
its consequences. The code that once simulated danger on screen is now simulating truth, identity, and even our
40:59
perception of reality. The Matrix was a cautionary tale, right? Yes, it was wrapped in a lot of
John's Warning: The Simulation Is Here
41:05
interesting comic book anime like foundation, but underneath it, of course, is a cautionary tale. We don't
41:12
want to end up being enslaved by these wondrous, remarkable, and occasionally
41:18
potentially dangerous systems that we're inventing here. We want to make sure that we improve humanity, not risk it
41:26
all, and take people in the other direction. There is a certain like psychological warfare that seems to
41:31
always be going on uh through the media whatever stage of the media we happen to be talking about whether it's propaganda
41:39
you know during world wars or whether it's you know much more subversive uh you know in social media I mean there's
41:46
a lot of that uh to be aware of because the intent is to influence people so
41:51
that another group has some form of advantage and I don't agree with that at all and I I think that is the um that is
41:59
the immediate concern that we're walking into right now. There's a big difference between that and um intended
42:05
disinformation sole purpose of hurting people that unfortunately is just going to be unleashed upon us. It's already
42:11
starting right like you know we're going to move from you know proofs, prototypes, tests, you know what I mean
42:16
about what's technically possible with Gen Gen Vid and all um to very
42:22
deliberate campaigns. I mean it's already kind of beginning, right? disinformation campaigns. And let's be clear, this isn't some
42:28
long-term threat to the future. This is happening right now. Deep fakes twist our faces. Disinformation rewrites our
42:35
history. Elections, movements, trust is rewired by invisible code that's hard to
42:40
even inspect. The simulation isn't coming. It's here. And the scariest part, we've stopped noticing. We're like
42:47
a fish in water. In a sense, the Matrix didn't just
42:53
imagine the future. It rewired the ambitions of an entire generation. I'm talking coders, filmmakers,
43:00
technologists, designers, heck, even myself. Look at these cheesy videos I
43:05
made as a 12-year-old inspired by what I saw inside the Matrix. We all saw a
43:10
world built from scratch and asked ourselves, "Why not me?" So, the question isn't just what comes next.
43:16
It's how do you thrive in this new world order? When we made the Matrix trilogy, you know, we were making movies. We were
43:22
creating the illusion right of a future world where one could step into flawless simulation. But we did a few things. It
43:30
turned out to be the kernels right of things that would grow into where we are today which is being at the precipice at
43:38
the literal inflection point where we will in fact walk inside of simulations, story worlds, social worlds on a level
43:45
that has only been thought about in science fiction. We are almost there. Today, we have all the tools to be those
43:52
worldbuilders. In a sense, we're not just watching the story unfold. We're creating this new mythology together,
43:58
literally manifesting this world into reality. That's where the story gets really exciting. The conversation
44:03
doesn't just end here. I want to know what you think. What does the future of entertainment look like to you? Leave
44:09
your answer in the comments below. And that's the discussion we want to have. Thanks for watching and subscribe to be
