Intro: Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana’s Rise & The Future of Digital Dollars
0:00
The fact that we now have stable coin legislation and that people are projecting like 1 trillion to 10
0:06
trillion worth of digital dollars being minted over the next, you know, 5 years is going to massively accelerate things.
0:13
Why does your company exist and second why we need it? Salana's there to really enable that 1
0:19
billion people to go fully interconnected. Bitcoin is store value. Ethereum is settlement. Salana is
0:24
execution. I just simply wasn't interested in settlement or store value because they're not uh the kind of
0:31
engineering problem that I'm interested in solving. So is that the future? A single machine
0:36
layer for all markets everywhere. There's no computer science academic
0:42
reason why it can't exist. It's purely an engineering problem and we're on our way to solve it like as fast as we can.
0:49
How long before this science fiction future could come into existence? My gut is uh uh
0:56
now that's a moonshot ladies and gentlemen. Hey everybody, welcome to Moonshots.
1:03
Here with my Moonshot mates Dave London. Hey Dave. Hey Alexer Gross.
1:08
Hey Peter. Hey and Salem Ismael. And we have a special guest today. We're going to be diving into Salana.
1:16
Anatoli Yakoveno is here. software engineer, entrepreneur, co-founder and
1:21
CEO of Sana Labs, which today is the sixth largest coin. Uh, now worth over
1:26
hundred billion dollars. Congratulations for that.
1:32
Yeah, you know, 100 billion, 100 billion there on your way to a trillion. Uh, you know, a bachelor's in computer science
1:38
from University of Illinois. Urbane, uh, began your career at Qualcomm. Uh, an
1:43
amazing company, right? uh uh I had a chance to watch their domination and uh
1:49
Salana has emerged as the leader in decentralized finance and blockchain uh
1:55
generating what is that 2.2 billion in annual revenues between 2024 and 25. Uh
2:02
that's extraordinary. It's it's the cool one around MIT. I can tell you that firsthand too.
2:08
I'll give you some quotes later. But yes, you are you are known and you are cool. That's awesome.
2:14
Yeah. So, uh, uh, guys, today, uh, I really want to hit on a few things,
Solana 101: Bitcoin = Store, Ethereum = Settlement, Solana = Execution
2:19
which is the crypto essential, sort of Salana 101, what makes it different from Bitcoin and Ethereum. Want to dive into
2:26
Salana as a use of payments, sort of the everything coin, and then really the
2:32
convergence of crypto and AI, which is going to cause this explosion in the
2:37
global economy. Um let me begin with a question that is on my mind um to which
2:45
is you know given sort of our incredible rush towards AGI every dollar in the ecosystem is being sucked into this
2:51
black hole of computronium we're building across the planet. So we've got AI we've got agents we have Salana we
2:58
have stable coins. What's the future of money going to look like? I mean do you
3:03
think it's going to be recognizable in the next 10 years? I think um the two things that I see
3:11
converging uh is that the cost for intelligence is dropping and markets
3:17
require intelligence and um because it's now cheaper to have intelligence to analyze all the signal in the world you
3:24
can now have a lot more markets and public permissionless blockchains like Salana allow you to create markets
3:31
permissionlessly for whatever random thing is and you kind of saw this with prediction markets and poly market and
3:36
kshi kind of taking But the weird kind of cool experiments like futarchi where
3:42
you have decision markets for every decision that a fund or a company can
3:47
take, those can now exist. And as intellig intelligence gets cheaper, you
3:54
have more markets that are viable and you kind of see this exponential explosion of uh everything being decided
AI, Agents & Markets: The Future of Money
4:00
through market forces, which I think is uh it's like the quote I made before the
4:08
podcast is like the ants are not aware of the intelligence of the antill. I can't fit all these markets in my head
4:14
or like the outcome of this, but my gut is that uh this is probably the most
4:20
optimal direction for kind of for society to move forward and make decisions, the more market based it is
4:26
and the more intelligence you have to make those decisions correctly and the forcing function of losing money is like
4:32
a good way to to course correct when you have bad intelligence. So hopefully it's it's a good thing but beyond my I can't
4:39
fit it all in my head. It's beyond my comprehension. The speed of change is awesome right
4:46
now, right? I mean I I I think and and Alex we talk about this like economy 3.0
4:52
in the future. Yes. Before we started recording to and I were were I I would say sort of
4:57
lamenting the sad case of truth terminal the autonomous AI agent that's being forced to mint its own meme coins just
5:04
in order to survive in this like really harsh world for for AI agents right now. I mean to to I I'd be curious. So in
5:13
principle, new layer 1 ones in including Salana offer the the premise for AI
5:18
agents just to survive. Humans for the most part were banked. We we have the ability to to engage in a human economy.
5:25
If if you're a a a baby AI agent just trying to find its way in this world and
5:31
you can't open a bank account, you you can't interact as a first class citizen. What do you do? Like what what what's
5:36
T's handbook? What what's your what's guide for Can you tell a good joke?
5:43
Can you can you tell a good joke? Then you can survive. I think that is the the finalistment test for true AGI is can
5:50
you entertain a person or not even like a complex person. Can you keep a toddler
5:55
entertained? The how do you how do you economically survive if you're a baby agi and and you
6:01
want to be autonomous? Um I think yeah, memecoins is like a
6:07
weirdian beauty contest for attention. uh could work then if can you keep
6:13
people paying attention to you by being entertaining then you can probably pay for the inference to do that
6:20
that that's the main business model that I see right now for these poor baby AGIS so it it's you know maybe as uh as as an
6:28
assignment to to to you the the creator of Salana we need a better business model for for these baby AGIs to survive
6:35
other than minting meme coins Alex can you imagine an a an AGI coming to you and say
6:40
would you please adopt me? I need a human shield. I need a human to sort of fend for me in the banking system with a with a credit card. I need a
6:47
I think in some sense, Peter, like that's the corporation model that we have right now with with AI using
6:52
corporations as embodiment for for themselves as economic actors. Every week, my team and I study the top
6:58
10 technology metat trends that will transform industries over the decade ahead. I cover trends ranging from
7:04
humanoid robotics, AGI, and quantum computing to transport, energy, longevity, and more. There's no fluff,
7:10
only the most important stuff that matters, that impacts our lives, our companies, and our careers. If you want
7:16
me to share these meta trends with you, I write a newsletter twice a week, sending it out as a short two-minute
7:21
read via email. And if you want to discover the most important meta trends 10 years before anyone else, this

7:51
Why don't we kick ourselves off with a little bit of the Salana vision here because our our buddy Mike Sailor has,
7:57
you know, he's the Bitcoin promoter of all promoters, but Bitcoin has be the original vision of Bitcoin was as a
8:03
transactional tool. Now it's become a store of wealth, a huge store of wealth, but it's way too slow to be the
8:10
transactional engine of the future. And so you're, you know, Alex's baby AI is no way he's going to sit there at the
8:16
cash register for 20, 30, 40, you know, years of AI time trying to buy
8:22
something. But, uh, you know, Ethereum came after that, but now Salana, I heard on your last podcast, a thousand times
8:28
faster than the Ethereum chain. So, it's it's keeping up with AI basically, right?
8:34
Yeah, that's the goal. And I think um very very simple way to think of it is like Bitcoin is store value, Ethereum is
8:42
settlement, Solano's execution. And I just simply wasn't interested in settlement or store value because
8:49
they're not uh the kind of engineering problem that I'm interested in solving. And execution is a very uh hard like not
8:57
I don't think it's a computer science problem where we need theoretical solutions. It's a it's just a fun engineering problem like how do you move
9:04
bits as fast as possible around the world. Um and these this is what I like
9:10
to get my hands dirty and I was just kind of gravitated towards that. I would I would love to hear a little
9:16
bit of this history behind the proof of history concept that you came up with. Totally. Um cuz I think that's such a
9:22
fascinating uh unique approach to blockchains. Also, while we're doing this, I'm I'm unboxing a Seeker phone
9:29
live. Nice. I have a Salana Seeker phone that I that I got that I've been wanting to unbox
The Birth of Proof of History
9:34
for a while. So, uh, but curious to hear about that. Yeah, it's um it's uh so first of all,
9:42
I'm not a uh researcher. I'm an engineer. I spent most of my career at Qualcomm. Got there right after college
9:49
in 2003 and was just really interested in um optimizing how fast you can move
9:54
bits through memory. So, I was a performance nerd. I would have dreams where I have debugger windows between
10:01
different co-processors because I would stare at them for so many weeks like just trying to debug
10:06
problems and stuff. Um, and I was definitely aware of Bitcoin when it came
10:12
out um and Ethereum as well and kind of as an engineer you you often overlook
10:17
the social aspect of these things. So you kind of look at it, oh, it's not going to scale or not going to work, but
10:22
kind of miss the whole transformative change that these things could provide because they're so new and and weird.
10:28
And uh in 2017, um I was actually working at a side project. Always had a
10:34
side project. This one was building deep learning boxes for transformers and
10:39
mining crypto in the background because you could pay for the GPUs this way as off to offset the capex.
10:46
Oh wow. And this is I was just doing this for fun. with a friend of mine uh another
10:51
Qualcomm nerd uh that I do side projects with and um we I had two coffees and a
10:57
beer at Cafe Sole in San Francisco. It's a combination that usually doesn't sit with anyone didn't sit with me. So I was
11:04
up till 4 in the morning and we were discussing proof of work and this idea could we build a single threaded mining
11:10
system that was just totally different concept and I kind of had this Eureka moment at 4:00 a.m. that there's a way
11:16
to measure different physical constant than anthropy uh which is what proof of
11:22
work does for civil resistance. There's a way to actually measure passage of time in a way that's hard to fake. And
11:29
this is a recursive cryptographic hash function like SHA 256. You run it over
11:35
itself and you run this process and you sample it and you get a data structure that you can say then well it's
11:41
incredibly hard to beat TSMC by more than a factor of two at how fast you can make a processor. So the amount of time
11:48
that somebody took to generate this data structure is at least X. And obviously you can cheat and go a little faster but
11:56
you cannot go arbitrarily faster. you're basically limited by where technology is today. Um, and that was this Eureka
12:04
moment in my head because even though I wasn't working at protocols at Qualcomm, just being at a cellular protocol
12:11
company, you get you just know how the stuff works. And one of the first cellular protocols that anyone ever
12:17
built was called time division multiple access. Yes. TDMA. Yes. Yeah. And um this actually like if you
12:22
remember your physics classes if you two radio towers transmit over the same time at the same frequency you get noise. So
12:29
the first thing that they gave them is a clock to alternate and that's what how you get TDMA. Well in in Bitcoin in
12:35
proof of work you have a similar problem. If you if you produce a block at the same time in two different parts
12:40
of the world you get a collision. So the network is in this noisy state and information is not passing through. So
12:46
the difficulty adjustment in Bitcoin is almost very similar to how Aloha has
12:52
like a random adjustment to retransmit in a random base radio protocol is you're trying to prevent this collision
12:58
from occupying the same channel. So you stretch it out to make sure the probability of a collision is very
13:03
small. But because you're doing that you're lowering the channel efficiency. You can't send as many bits through it.
13:09
So as soon as I had this like, oh, I have this clock that nobody needs to trust as a third party provider, I can
13:16
do the same trick and maximizing the number of bits I can shove through the network. And my backup envelope was
13:22
like, oh, this is at least 10,000 times faster than Bitcoin. So that was this
13:28
kind of thing that like I built TDMA for blockchain. So what's what's funny is
13:33
that um I don't know I was bad at like selling the idea to venture capital or
13:41
maybe I was good enough like but this idea that what you really the problem that you're solving is this channel
13:46
efficiency problem like that was hard for me to actually communicate in those early days and I was more focused oh
13:53
this is a whole new consensus algorithm the yada yada really focusing on the implementation side more so than what it
13:59
unlocks and years later um now like I think we're in what year seven for
14:05
Salana and like year 20 for crypto in general we now see the next generation consensus algorithms don't actually have
14:12
to depend on the clock like proof history but do solve this problem of channel efficiency so um we got so
14:20
successful that I was able to hire kind of best-in-class bleeding edge consensus team out of ETHZurich that are throwing
14:28
away proof history and all the code that could help in the early is but clearly
14:33
understand the problem that I solved and like this is what this is the problem you solve this is why it's important and
14:39
why that's a good thing but you don't actually need all this complexity so it's now I get to see my baby retired in
Building the Perfect Layer 1
14:46
a way just so everybody knows ETH Zurich is it's the MIT of Europe has nothing to do
14:52
with Ethereum just total coincidence that it's called ETH but nothing to do with Ethereum
14:58
that that's such a the full like founding storytell in part I I never made the the connection between uh TDMA
15:06
and and just in general the Qualcomm view of of wireless and and and aiming
15:12
for high throughput. I'm I'm curious if you were to mentally run the clock forward. So uh although source code for
15:18
earlier versions from Solanda Lab still preserved for posterity on on GitHub I see but if you fast forward what does
15:25
the perfect layer 1 look like to you? like what where do you see all of this going if you could fast forward 10 years
15:32
15 years? Yeah, I think um like what is it solving
15:37
right? So I think if you're solving execution what you're trying to do is have as many markets around the world
15:44
synchronized as much as possible and there's several challenges there and one is uh you look at like something like
15:51
NASDAQ or NIS it's a centralized piece of memory like literally it exists in a
15:56
single physical location so um and that seems like the fastest way to
16:02
build something you can build sub microcond matching engine and like run really really fast markets there but The
16:07
problem that it has is that if you have like an event in Singapore where like a container ship full of iPhone sinks
16:13
outside your window, that information still has to go speedy through fiber from Singapore to New York before it's
16:20
it it's in the market. Yeah. So, uh,
16:25
perfect layer 1 is something that can do both. And the way that we envision it at Salana is you actually have concurrent
16:32
block producers that are making blocks at the same time. one in Singapore, one in New York. So your latency to the
16:40
block producer is as short as possible and they're located to where all the signal is like in the most important
16:46
markets. You have concurrently ingesting transactions and your latency to stick this data into the chain so markets can
16:54
now take action on it is as low as possible. So this is kind of the communication physics problem. And this
17:00
is again the analogy that's kind of dumb but works is you're going from TDMA to CDMMA. We have concurrent channels you
17:07
can simultaneously use at the same time. Um, and you can shove all this information into this single giant state
17:13
machine that is churning through it as fast as we can synchronize around the world. So, is that the future? A single uh
17:21
machine layer for all markets everywhere. Yes. That everything is living on top of.
17:28
If you imagine science fiction finance 20, 50 years from now, that's what it looks like. And this is where there's no
17:36
computer science academic reason why it can't exist. It's purely an engineering problem and we're on our way to solve it
17:42
like as fast as we can. Totally. If you could walk us through concretely like what is it in your mind what does that future look like? Does it
17:48
look like e every every object everywhere where we talk on the pod all the time about tiling the earth with
17:54
data centers and and with No, you you you talk. Okay. We just we agree. We agree.
18:02
Okay. first person singular. I I talk all the time about tiling the earth with with
18:08
compute. But in your mind, does does this does this vision concretely involve
18:14
basically embedding like Shaw or like hash function proof of history
18:20
generation in every object everywhere? No, you no, you don't need you don't need any of that. um with just kind of
18:27
the next generation Byzantine full tolerant consensus like Alpenlow there's or there's a bunch of other options but
18:33
um you can just have concurrent nodes that are ingesting signal anywhere in
18:39
the world where there's valuable signal and what's kind of interesting for a proof ofstake network people will move
18:45
stake to those places so they can run those block producers more often and therefore be the pro the center that
18:51
ingests that signal into the chain And that's the most profitable part you can
18:56
do because the way that these networks, proof ofstake networks make money is you have markets on chain. There is value at
19:04
risk in those markets. And the faster you get data to adjust those markets,
19:09
the the faster you can make money, right? Like your cost of opportunity to being late, to being second to take that
19:15
trade is effectively the entire profit of that trade. So you're now incentivized to go and start
19:22
colllocating next to the signal whether that's Singapore, London, New York, LA or whatever, or in the future, who knows
19:28
where. You can move the block production next to where that signal is produced that impacts markets. You ingest the
19:35
data as fast as you can into the single global data structure. And it's actually not that big because markets themselves
19:42
and trades and all this other stuff, they're not eight five, you know, uh, you know, 4K video streamed in real time
19:50
driving in China to a person in LA driving, right? This is what Qualcomm built is mind-blowingly complex, low
19:57
latency, high throughput stuff. Markets and trades and all and all these other things are actually relatively small
20:03
amount of memory and small amount of messages in comparison. So the yeah the
20:10
NFL is building all the infra for us like that. How long before this science fiction
20:17
future could come into existence and is there a tipping point at which point when enough people are on that player on
20:24
that on that platform on that layer it makes you know it doesn't make sense for NASDAQ not to be there it doesn't make
20:31
sense for everything else not to be there. Yeah, I think you'll still have very localized markets because there is
20:37
advantages to being colloccated and having that like lite cone around micro
20:42
structure and like the cues. There are people talking about lite cones. That's great. Yeah, in that little like server room in
20:48
NASDAQ, there's actually a lot of value into having that part run. But to build
20:54
a single global kind of layer for all these stuff to synchronize, I think that that's kind of the challenge that we
21:00
want to take on. Um, how fast is going to happen? And I think I think the fact
21:05
that we now have stable coin legislation and that people are projecting like 1 trillion to 10 trillion worth of digital
21:12
dollars being minted over the next you know 5 years is going to massively accelerate things because those dollars
21:19
are going to get minted for all sorts of trade purposes and settlement between
21:24
you know like in inner country and and basically globally. And once those
21:30
dollars are there, it's just a very simple interface to interact with them. Even yeah, the the price to move dollars
21:37
from Ethereum to Salana is a million times cheaper than to move it between any two banks.
21:44
We we had we had Jeremy Aair on the pod two weeks ago, so we're discussing this. See, what are you what are you thinking
DeFi & the Reinvention of Finance
21:51
right now? Um it feels to me like one of the most incredible applications here would be
21:56
the whole DeFi world. And can you speak to what you guys are doing there?
22:01
Yeah, so I I think of you know like what are smart contract platforms do is they
22:07
implement some kind of escrow mechanism is that you can escrow money and then conditionally release it based on some
22:13
action in the future and that's could be altering complete computation or whatever. Um, and DeFi is basically the
22:21
use case for this is being able to conditionally place money at risk based on oracle or market or whatever some
22:28
future signal. Um, and I think it effectively applies to almost everything
22:34
that businesses do, right? Like you have to borrow money from somebody that requires Astro and requires risk
22:41
calculations that are running all the time and things like that. So the the challenge here is that like we have in
22:47
the US we have a really really amazing financial system. It was mostly built kind of like after the railroad boom and
22:55
the scams there and before World War II and kind of a little bit after World War II as it as that was exported to the
23:01
Western world. It was all built before the internet and it it functions amazing amazingly because through a lot of trial
23:07
and error regulators actually constructed processes and systems that are very robust but they're all human
23:14
based and this human action is what forces two-day settlement. It's like
23:19
it's very hard to cut that down to one day or 4 hours or or 10 milliseconds because people are are in the loop. um
23:26
blockchain was built even Bitcoin with its 10 mil 10 minute blocks was built
23:31
well after the internet and it can rely on cryptography and the fact that I
23:37
don't even know if NATO can actually reliably partition the internet anymore like it we we live in a super connected
23:43
connected world and we have cryptography that can mathematically guarantee correctness of of of certain actions
23:50
you know just just to reinforce your point you just made I was at a public company board meeting all morning and we
23:55
were talking about something we might be interested in acquiring. And one of the board members said, "Well, maybe they'll just go public." And the other board
24:01
members said, "There hasn't been a an IPO below a $3 billion valuation in like decade. You can't even afford the legal.
24:07
The friction is so high." Like, "Wow, how's that going to work in the world of AI?" Like, the friction is way too high
24:14
for that system. Like you said, built after the railroad, Texas, baby, before World War II, the Texas exchanges are coming.
24:21
Yeah. But there's there's 50,000 meme coins launched a day and there hasn't been a single IPO and like you know the
24:29
number of IPOs I think have shrunk to the slowest level since like the 70s or something like that.
24:35
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's I'd like to pull on that that point if I might totally I mean so I think stable
24:41
coin amazing right? So, so you know the Collison brothers call it uh room temperature superconductors for finance
24:47
in principle driving international money transfer efficiency to infinity. But
24:52
what in your mind is sort of the the killer app for layers two and three that
24:58
expands the the wealth of humanity versus just driving efficiencies at at
25:03
in terms of money tren. like where's the Dows for a while? We're going to to create an entirely new class of economic
25:10
actors um mixed sort of success. What's the big transformative outcome that we
25:15
get that radically expands human wealth? Um I think the what you should start
25:21
seeing is the cost of finance to basically drop to its vual value it's
25:27
providing. So the the challenge here is like you like you look at like the um
25:33
Figment IPO I think what what they lost like 3 billion right in that process in
25:38
a single transaction. That's 10% of the market cap of the company which is kind of crazy where if if you have 10 1 to 10
25:46
trillion stable coins you have incredibly deep onchain markets. they could literally just use a smart
25:52
contract to direct list. And if they use like a a third party to go actually
25:58
create that market, that party has to actually provide the value that
26:03
comparable to to what they're getting for it, right? Like they could maybe like be the person that they use an
26:09
analyst or whatever to actually go dive deep into the company and like create that nice set of information that
26:16
everyone else consumes so they can participate with, you know, safety or whatever in that market. But none of the
26:22
listing or access to capital, all of the stuff is fully on chain. There's zero cost to actually get access to it. Like
26:28
all you're trying to do then is get above the noise floor in terms of like signal. Yeah, you should allocate
26:34
capital here because of XYZ. Um, and providing that value I think is important and then how much you charge
26:40
for it should be at the most competitive price ever. Like I think this is where we see like I think finance right now is
26:47
taking out a huge chunk of like the GDP and it's a tax. It's not actually
26:53
generating as much value as it's hand in the gears. The statistic I've seen is over the last
27:00
decade of the corporate American profits sent 40% of corporate American profits
27:07
went to the financial services sector. It's like an unbelievable uh sucking sound there.
27:13
But pulling the thread on that if I may. So I if if the desired end state in your
27:18
mind is basically driving profits in financial services to zero um a is there
27:25
is there anything beyond that or like if if if blockchain technologies in general not not just Salana's layer 1
27:32
specifically are able to suck all the profit out of financial services do you declare victory is is that sort of the
27:38
the end and you move on to something new or is there something even larger than just making financial services
27:43
profitless? I think the end result of that is you basically have talent
27:49
anywhere in the world. So that can acquire capital from anywhere in the world and that unlocks like human
27:56
potential, right? Like I have a really great idea. I'm an engineer in Ukraine or whatever. I can now get funding from
28:03
people in China, US, Australia and I'm not relying on the um you know the kind
28:10
of the trust model that like a a safe is based on NYC. that the fact that YC do
28:16
did due diligence in this particular person that then you can invest in them and this kind of flimsy contract that
28:22
right like I think which which is awesome like I think the fact that that works and reliably reliably produces
28:29
great results is testament to like how important finance is and to like innovation so we need to eliminate all
28:37
those barriers so you can actually have as many founders in the world starting companies and getting to that profitable
28:44
state and creating value. This is the velocity of the velocity of money um going through the roof, right? It's
28:50
it's accessibility and velocity finding the lowest level um and and just
28:56
becoming a a fuel to for acceleration of the economy. Can can you give us your
29:01
vision on the regulatory like if you look at Meror as an example you here's a
29:06
company two years old getting close to a billion dollars of revenue unleashed a whole new class of employee in the AI
29:13
world but still paying them through traditional banking means and obviously that needs to move on to Solana and be
29:20
frictionless but you've had an incredible journey through different regulatory regimes in just in just your
29:26
sevenyear history it's got to be the most crazy roller coaster and that's just in the US. Look at the, you know, every jurisdiction in the world. So,
Regulation, Trust & the New Legal Layer
29:32
how's that going to unfold as this, you know, this over-the-top economy rolls out?
29:38
Uh, I mean, Paul Atkins and Hester Peers have been awesome and David Saxs has been awesome. And you can kind of think
29:44
of uh that like the the whole securities law was created in United States. So,
29:51
when your neighbor says, "I have this railroad certificate. Give me some money for it." And you get it. that one is
29:58
it's a real certificate that railroad company exists and you have all the information to actually make that
30:04
decision. So a lot of stuff can go wrong there, right? The even if your neighbor is not lying to you, they could
30:11
literally have a fake piece of paper or the company doesn't exist or the company lied about everything that it's doing
30:17
and there is no actual railroad. So those scams actually happened and fueled
30:22
a lot of railroad construction and a lot of kind of bad financial decisions in in the late 19th century
30:27
and a lot of regulatory paperwork. Exactly. So what's cool now is is the
30:33
the difference that blockchain creates is kind of like the SSL little lock in e-commerce in the '90s. I can transfer
30:40
you a token. You can cryptographically verify that this token goes back to the
30:45
issuer with the issuer's public keys that signed off on their financial statements, all the stuff that they
30:51
published, their swan, etc. And you know that you're actually receiving what they're claiming to be their equity. So
30:58
when you're paying for it, all those guarantees that are solved with regulation are now just solved with math
31:03
and data. Just like the SSL lock tells you when I put in my credit card number here, some inter intermediary sending
31:10
this data is not going to steal my credit card. So, a lot of stuff that humans do kind of goes away. And the
31:17
regulators have a hard time getting up to speed to that because there's a lot
31:23
of stuff that simply works. And there's no reason to change stuff that works when there's a lot of financial risk at stake. But the fact that the whole
31:30
crypto industry outside of support of any regulation has been able to grow so
31:35
dramatically to such a large market cap like with Bitcoin and Ethereum and Salana kind of leading it um is the fact
31:43
that this stuff actually solves real world problems. The reason why somebody in Singapore can go start a protocol
31:50
around trading coins and make money and ROI is because people can trust that
31:55
settlement and execution of those assets and they're willing to put money at risk and because the software minimizes the
32:01
risk they can maximize the amount of money they actually put at risk into these systems. So it's happening anyways
32:06
like it's happening with or without United States. I think with uh the regulation on board now and like with
32:13
the stable coin act like coming out, I think you're just going to see this accelerating and a lot of these services
32:20
and and kind of um the intermediaries along the stack are all like one
32:27
resistant to change, but also there's so many of them. Some of them are always looking for an opportunity to move up
32:32
and down their their vertical and and kind of expand. May maybe dwelling for for a moment on
32:38
the regulatory side. So I in a paper contract you know you mentioned the the Y combinator safe earlier you have a few
32:44
parties and there's a whole societal apparatus built around paper contracts. You have court systems and rule of law
32:51
and regulations w with u with salana or or other smart contract you have to
32:57
first order approximately none of that. Uh and so so I'm curious where do you see this going? Do you think rule of law
33:04
basically moves onchain in some sense with with bodies to adjudicate disputes
33:09
also onchain? How do disputes work in a future where hypothetically everything's on chain?
33:16
I think you're minimizing the number of intermediaries necessary to go do the
33:21
right thing. So if somebody raises money and they lies they lie about their purpose of of raising those funds,
33:27
that's fraud. And if they do it on a public blockchain or not, they're still liable. Doesn't matter whether they do
33:33
it with a safe or not. What changes is that if you do it on chain is that I
33:39
don't have to rely on some transfer agent or broker or whatever to facilitate moving these contracts around
33:45
or to certify that this this contract actually does belong to this YC company.
33:50
You can actually do all that verification. And so all kind of the boring stuff that people don't think about when they think about finance, all
33:57
those little service layers that all take a few bips off the top, those go away and you're dealing directly with
34:03
that company as the issuer. They could they could obviously use some third party service provider to implement the
34:09
software to manage all of these things and there's a bunch of them like squads on Salana is like a great example of
34:15
that formally verified multi-IG contracts for managing governance and all this stuff. But at the end of the
34:22
day, if it's a company that's claiming they're doing X and you buy this thing,
34:27
the end result that enforces whether that company's lying or not is going to be the local jurisdiction where they're
34:33
incorporated and they're still just as liable. I totally totally get it as a stepping
34:38
stone toward where Alex is going. Um the actual just the safe note itself.
34:44
So just to take this hypothetical transaction, you know, I want to invest in your company. You're in Singapore. Uh
34:50
here's my money. It's on chain. Uh what about the safe node itself? Do you just store that and hash it and then put the
34:56
hash on chain or how do how do you deal with the actual terms of the safe note or do you not touch that? I mean this is where you want to draw
35:02
the abstraction. There are there are efforts to actually use the ledger as the the cap table. So whatever's on the
35:11
ledger, however these safe nodes are allocated and distributed those public keys, private keys, that's the actual
35:17
cap table. And then you can build all the cap table management software on top of that because that's a public data
35:23
structure. You can manipulate and move those around and whatever rules you want around clawing back shares or only
35:30
allowing transactions if the company agrees. You can encode all those in a smart contract reliably. Um, and all
35:38
that stuff is just code. It's a pain in the butt because it's a bunch of database kind of gnarly code, but it's
35:45
all doable. Um, but this would be the best way to do it because then you're
35:51
getting rid of all these other layers, transfer agent, brokers, etc. Like all those people are gone. Not just that, but I don't want to beat
35:57
this Y cominator safe note to death, but but if you look at the actual terms of the note, because we do these every day,
36:03
uh, they're not settled in the courts, you know, they they go straight to jams or to some third party because the
36:09
courts will be years before they decide what they want to do. And so it's already it's not on chain, but it's
36:15
certainly out of the courts. and out of the federal and and state system because it's just too slow.
36:20
So like I think bankruptcy could be one of those things that could be dramatically optimized where it took
36:26
like two years to resolve the FTX bankruptcy. Um that was a massive bankruptcy in crypto, but because FTX is
36:33
not is a is a centralized exchange that is not a as a company a DeFi company,
36:40
right? They just bought and sold tokens like a any other centralized financial system. when they collapse, it's
36:45
incredibly messy to go and bind all of that and like to go through the bankruptcy law and figure out who owns
36:51
what. When in reality, if it was like a single ledger, even if it was a
36:56
permission one, if they just ran a ledger, one is you would immediately see that the amount of money going out is
37:03
more than the amount of money going in. That would be obvious immediately. So,
37:08
you you wouldn't even get to that stage where you have bankruptcy. But if you did like A has liquidations which is
37:16
effectively the bankruptcy process when you borrow and you and you can't repay those are programmatically encoded and
37:23
run on every block every 12 seconds in Ethereum and Camino does it every 400
37:28
milliseconds on Salana. So you would never even get to that stage where you have to spend 2 years to figure out who
37:34
owns what. It would get liquidated and processed immediately. And I think that
The Byzantine Generals Problem Explained
37:40
is a really critical part in finance. Like if if you can invest knowing that in case of a bankruptcy that there is
37:46
this deterministic process that's run immediately. Everyone gets the best what you could get out of of out of that
37:53
process within like a minute. It makes investing a lot more viable especially
38:00
across jurisdictions where you may not have uh the ability to go uh enforce it in the courts like in Ukraine or
38:06
whatever. So I think those those FTX investors were getting 50 50 cents on the dollar, 60 cents on the dollar
38:13
because of I it's just an insane amount of money lost in that friction just in that FTX case.
38:18
Uh let's go to Sem. Sem ask a really intelligent question that I'll understand. Okay.
38:25
Well, I want to make two points then I'll ask a question. The question the point one point I want to make is there's a really important distinction
38:32
around digital and crypto which is the value of crypto is not the fact that it's digital. is the fact that it's
38:37
programmable and what Tony talks about when you can do settlements all programmatically it manages it all you
38:43
it's all done you don't have to think about it and that takes it away from the human layer and it takes it away from
38:48
all sorts of other things I think it's worth for our readers at whatever time to just take a step back and understand
38:54
the Byzantine general's problem because that's actually sitting at the core of a lot of this so I'm I'm happy to get into
39:00
that question but can I take a minute and describe that Peter sure yeah of course okay so
39:06
I remember I remember you were the first person ever to tell me about it. This is such a fun foundational thing.
39:11
So for the viewers that aren't familiar with Bitcoin blockchains, Salana, etc. The core innovation at the heart of
39:17
blockchains was what's called the Byzantine general's problem. It's actually the story of Constantinople in
39:23
the 15th century. There were eight generals circling the city. They're trying to coordinate a siege and they were sending messages around that
39:29
network. Who's going to go first? What time should we attack? Who? How are we going to get in? etc. And the problem they had was one out of the eight
39:35
generals was a traitor and could send the wrong information, lose the element of surprise, blow the whole operation.
39:40
And in computer science terms, that's become known as that problem because in and in computer science terms, it's how
39:46
do you send a trusted, secure, authenticated message over a network when you don't trust the network, right?
39:53
Really hard problem. 40 years of computer science piece has been trying to solve that problem until the
39:58
blockchain. And because of the consensus mechanism and the synchronization across multiple ledgers, you can now the if I
40:04
send to a message, he has a 100% guarantee that it came from me, wasn't double entered, can't be revoked, wasn't
40:11
tampered along the way. That's a magical thing in the digital world. And this provides an authentication layer and a
40:17
validity and a validation layer that allows all of this other stuff to take place. We all of the layers that we
40:24
talked about in the settlement stuff, etc., are all there to validate, secure, ratify, etc. This stuff wasn't screwed
40:30
along along the way. Now that all happens as part of the infrastructure and so that makes it unbelievably
40:36
powerful. The broader implications of decentralizing authentication are absolutely profound. And so for folks
40:43
that aren't aware of this, go check out this particular problem and the nuances around it. Um, I have a question around
40:49
that specifically. Add the double spending. Add the double spending problem in there too. Double spending problem. You can't you can't
40:55
get that into into that either which which is uh can you stop somebody from double spending in two different places
41:01
and then doubling up every time. Um the the question I have for you Tony early on there was a lot of criticism of
41:07
Salana for the decentralization over the last couple of years you guys have solved a lot of that and I think it
41:12
would be really great for you to explain what you guys have been doing and the architectural changes that have taken place because now it's really solid and
41:18
robust and on its way to Ethereum level decentralization. I think there's a lot of um if you're on
41:26
crypto Twitter, people fight about what is what does decentralization actually means. Um and it just depending who you
41:34
ask, it's whatever coin they own is decentralized and whatever coin they don't own is not.
41:41
But uh the way that I think um I've always approached it is I'm kind of a
41:47
you know started programming in the '9s. I'm a huge like open source Linux fan.
41:52
So it was just awesome for me to be able to analyze the software that I'm running on my computer and know exactly what's
41:58
happening, know why it's broken, why it's not. So we've always looked at permissionless being as the core part of
42:04
decentralization that it doesn't matter if uh the system is open source but can
42:10
I participate in every part of the stack without needing um like to be uh without
42:16
needing a third party to approve me. So can I run a validator? Can I make blocks? Can I transact on it? Can I
42:22
deploy code on it? But can I also own this like have a copy of that state and
42:28
be able to recover the entire network if if that kind of failure exists. So Salana is always focused on that aspect
42:34
of it that everybody every part of the system that anyone can run that it's
42:40
permissionless to go and run it. And I think that is incredibly critical for
42:45
this idea of a single layer for finance because no matter what, you're still
42:50
going to be dealing with people. Like if you have the science fiction futuristic layer finance for all of the world's
42:57
execution, it's still going to run in France and England and Spain and none of
43:02
those guys are ever going to really trust each other 100%. So the the banks in France will need to be
43:09
able to participate in every part of the stack. So will the banks in England, so will the banks in New York, even if
43:14
they're allies or whatever, but they need because they're people, they want to have control that they will need to
43:20
have access to every part of the system. And to make it really decentralized, you
43:25
have to allow for adversarial nodes that are either misconfigured or actually deliberately adversarial like the
43:32
Byzantine problem that you described where they're maliciously signing the wrong message. They're trying to double
43:37
spend. They're trying to create chaos in the network. The protocol has to be robust to handle that. Um, and you can
43:45
work it out on on paper. you can say we have all these proofs and formal
43:50
verification that it actually is uh robust with the Byzantine actors and
43:56
then in implementation things blow up. I think the Salana journey has been that
44:01
of we're trying to solve all of these problems at the same time, both performance and decentralization and
44:08
doing it, you know, as a startup shipping as fast as we can. There's a lot of trial and error or I would say
44:14
growing pains or blood, sweat, and tears that went into making Salana robust. It's incredible. Incredible what you

The Everything Coin & Consumer Adoption
45:25
Here, here's a challenge. What percentage of the of the world or let's look at the US do you believe
45:32
understands crypto at all if you had to guess? Um, a tenth of 1% of the population.
45:40
I think anyone that finished calculus can understand it. I mean basically can understand it the
45:48
difference between can understand and do understand. So I mean one of the one of the questions is you know the idea of
45:53
Salana as the everything coin that I'm using um let's define what that means first. What would salana as the
46:00
everything coin mean and then what would it take? Yeah go ahead. The coin itself that runs the network
46:07
its only purpose is to prevent spam in the network. So fundamentally like the only problem that it can solve is
46:15
disincentivized spam. So as part of solving this Byzantine general's problem where an adversarial node can send
46:21
infinite messages, there's a cost to send messages. That's the coin. But to
46:26
use it for anything else simply because it is tradable or can be easily sent, it
46:32
exists as any other coin in the network. And you can use I mean we encourage people to go use dollars for commerce.
46:39
If you're buying and selling stuff as a merchant, go use USDC or PayPal's USD or
46:45
any other digital currency. Um so that that to us it kind of doesn't matter what the coin the underlying token that
46:53
provides cryptoeconomic guarantees that adversaries pay some fixed cost for spam. That doesn't really matter like
47:00
what you use it beyond that. Um what's kind of been surprising to me and really
47:05
this has really been like you know when you start a startup not only you have no
47:11
idea what PMF is going to look like but the fact that as soon as you have markets and you have um money at escrow
47:19
and at risk the opportunity cost to be late to access those markets is so high that the fact that this underlying token
47:26
is what prevents spam in the network it can actually capture value that is uh
47:31
like substantial this the 2 billion whatever that you guys mentioned captured over the last years on Salana
47:38
that is because there's an opportunity cost to be late to send a trade and you're willing to pay the highest amount
47:45
to be first in the queue to actually go execute the trade and underneath the hood the only thing that the token is
47:51
doing is preventing spam. So the fact that it actually loops back and allows value capture for this thing
47:57
that was not planned and totally unexpected and almost like discovered through trial and error of us
48:03
getting such so much massive congestion on the network from NFT trading that that was the only way to solve the
48:10
problem and it was kind of the slight bone limit. Oh one this is a classic database hotspot problem like why didn't
48:15
I think of this when we started it's and two it actually works for money like Was
48:22
were the was the craze around NFTTS and memecoins a surprise to you?
48:29
Yeah, I mean when we started we you know our tagline was blockchain and NASDAQ speed and the idea was we're an
48:35
execution layer which can run arbitrary number of markets and kind of keep them all in a single state machine to
48:42
minimize to maximize capital efficiency, minimize the arbitrage opportunities. We
48:48
thought that was like really valuable and um the fact that memecoins took off was
48:54
really surprising because those are assets with no value in all price. But it kind of, you know, like if you if you
49:02
make look back at like the history of the internet, um it makes sense like if
49:08
soon as you have any kind of shared state that people have even if like I
49:13
played Ultima online as a kid and people would start trading gold and I actually
49:19
like built all these silly scripts that would automat
49:28
company. Yeah. British Brock Pierce. Brock Pierce, our buddy. And those things that that you know,
49:36
Ultima Online would is as much digital value as a memecoin, as Smartcoin.
49:43
There's nothing backing it, but people still wanted to trade and consume it. One, just for fun, but two, because you
49:49
now have this shared state with some economics. It just for whatever reason, as soon as you have any kind of shared
49:55
state, people create markets and start trading random things. want to be able to trade to bring those uh the gold and
50:01
the wood between different video games. How old are your kids? Um 10, six, and two and a half.
50:09
Okay. I got two 14-y old boys and and so does Leo, a 14-year-old boy. So, it's interesting, right? The entire video
50:15
game world is teaching an entire generation about the the value of
50:21
digital assets uh in an extraordinary fashion. Anyway,
50:27
yeah. Isn't it funny that that video games, you know, that's where the GPU came from that's now driving all of AI
50:32
and it's where crypto came from that to, you know, trade gold for wood or whatever within Minecraft or
50:38
may maybe to take the the counterpoint to that, before modern video games, we had board games and we had credit
50:44
systems and sort of fake money systems. So, it it's not in in some sense that
50:49
new. But I I guess may maybe a question for for totally pivoting off of a question sort of an adjacent question to
50:55
what Peter asked you earlier about how many people do understand crypto by
51:01
which I assume Peter's referring to cryptocurrency and and sort of layer one
51:06
layer layer two how many should because I I I think you were making the point
51:11
earlier almost like lamports soul this should be sort of under the hood and it
51:17
should just make everything frictionless. I I think of it as like the number of
51:23
people you invite to your wedding is roughly 200. That's like your your core group of people.
51:28
At least one or two of them understand Linux. One or two of them will understand crypto. That's and that's
51:36
enough cuz you can invite them to your wedding. You can trust them, right? And they'll explain it to you and
51:42
they can like tell you, okay, use it like this. This is how you minimize your risk and stuff like that. So I think the
51:47
number of people that you actually need to understand crypto in the world is like one in 200 like one per social
51:54
group. Your extended trust circle probably there.
51:59
So I think that that's that's striking. What what I understand you to be saying is this is not something that retail
52:05
investors should even be paying attention to which is contrary to a lot of messaging out there that everyone
52:12
should be paying attention to. So what I think I hear you saying is this is actually just infra under the hood to to
52:18
to build the next generation of financial services. I think it is very much a B2B system. I
52:25
think there is parts where it touches the consumer. So I mean when we built our phone we did a pre-sale and we had
52:32
credit card or stable coin as an option. Half of the purchases came via stable
52:37
coin without any incentives because the friction for somebody in Southeast Asia to use a stable coin is lower actually
52:43
than to use their local credit card for like an international purchase. So consumers will figure it out and you
52:50
have demand you know like if you have products that are available over stable coins people just use those rails on
52:57
their own. But it is it was actually the benefit I think was to us as a merchant
53:02
was very obvious. We save 2% on the gross sale amount which is like a three
53:08
or four engineering salaries like easily just on that one product. So you as a merchant immediately that you see oh if
53:15
I have this rail I don't have to pay the 2% fee. Yeah I'm going to use it like
53:20
why wouldn't I? Money's it's money in the bank instantly. So I think that like
53:26
huge improvement that will move dollars and like will have people take action I
53:32
think is going to be more in the business end but consumers will see the benefit of that ultimately.
53:39
A lot of the work now is going to be for web 3 services. Well, Peter and I talk about going from deceptive to
53:45
disruptive. Uh when something becomes exponential, it all always has a huge uh
53:50
10x change in usability, right? Coinbase makes Bitcoin easy to buy. Um Salana is
53:56
making it easy to transact. The usability layer has to be there and many web three services like I some liquidity
54:03
pools, DEX liquidity pools. The the complexity
54:08
of going through those and funding a pool etc is so ridiculous. I have to have a hardcore uh crypto sherpa
54:15
standing next to me to make sure I don't screw it up. It's insane. And so little by little those will uptick in terms of
54:21
usability and then it'll start becoming a a very very powerful tool for everybody. Alex, look you're pregnant with a
54:28
question. Yeah. No, I'm I'm I'm I'm trying to wrap my mind around this. So this is actually a question both for for Ti and Seem. So
Victory State: The Killer App for Humanity
54:34
I want to put you guys both on the spot and ask what do you think? So So let's fast forward to to the victory state. We
54:40
we've we've driven the the future of financial services to to to these highly vaunted superconductors for finance.
54:47
We've driven transaction costs down to near zero from credit card fees of 2 to 3%. We've achieved victory. What do you
54:55
view as the like the singular killer app, the concrete state that we've
55:00
unlocked in the future that creates radical wealth for all all of humankind?
55:06
What does that look like concretely? It's hard to to point to saying that
55:12
like um price like accurate price efficiency
55:18
globally is that big of a deal to a person? Like do you care how if you like
55:24
if the Starbucks get gets the best price for their coffee beans and the person making those gets the best price? Like
55:31
these are very abstract things that at end to end like my parents are not going to understand to where it really matters
55:38
to them. But the GDP will like move faster. We will make fewer errors in
55:43
finance. We will grow faster as a world and fewer and fewer people will be in poverty. I think that is kind of very
55:49
substantial. Like if 40% Yeah. Like concretely though like so so
55:55
but but let me ask let me ask you a question right now. What make what differentiates America in so many ways? It's is access to capital right
56:02
entrepreneurs uh throughout the US uh can put forward an idea reach
56:08
individuals get access to capital and one of the questions I have is is this going to is this going to increase the
56:14
speed of entrepreneurial creativity and financing and company financing where it
56:19
just supercharges the economy uh at a speed you know and Alex we talk about
56:24
sort of you know an ex if if I had time I would rewrite I would rewrite
56:30
economics for the future because economics are so fundamentally broken and so last century. So is this about
56:37
reinventing an economics 2.0 or 3.0? So
56:43
you know like all the companies that are worth over a trillion or like all the assets they're all US companies or
56:50
Bitcoin and I think maybe like the Saudi oil company, right? Yeah. So the the only place the other
56:58
like the other place for finance that can compete with the United States is the internet
57:03
and it's happening on the internet through crypto. So you're so you're now seeing like the kind of finance and
57:09
growth that happened in the United States being replicated on the internet through crypto rails and this is the
57:15
only place that I think could compete with the United States and actually in my opinion
57:20
at a gut level I think it is effectively helping United States export its influence because the internet is truly
57:27
an extension of all the values that we care about in the United States and it's so we're so deeply plugged into it. I
57:33
can give a kind of an anecdote, a real life anecdote that could maybe highlight some of this, Peter. Um, and maybe to
57:39
answer your uh question, Alex. If you look at say the NFT world where they started doing art on the internet,
57:46
right? You create a collection of 10,000 things uh 10,000 apes and start selling those and mint those. Uh, you have a
57:54
community building around those. All those, by the way, were default EXOs because they would have a big purpose and they would use cryptoeconomics to
58:00
incentivize the community to mint. The first people that got to mint got them for very cheap and then if you minted
58:06
later, you paid a little bit more, etc., etc. What then happened was you had a
58:11
bunch of breakages in the system. There were some rug pulls where people collected a lot of money and and the
58:16
collection were basically down on the vine, etc. People are now doing uh turnarounds where they're buying old
58:22
collections uh that are really good art and and repurposing them, etc. There's a
58:27
whole M&A thing going on in the in the NFT world. Uh what's fascinating about this is that it's art in a different
58:34
form because it's programmatic art. That's an experience of the art that's not normal that you would look at a
58:40
painting on a wall. You're engaging with it in a digital mode. So with board apes for example, they gave the ability to
58:47
take the the if you own a board ape, you own the intellectual property of that character and you could license it out
58:53
to people and to TV shows and people started doing that and that created one new wave of innovation. Then we had uh
59:01
cyber kongs that that created the coins within the thing. So they the if you own a cyber Kong uh NFT, it issued bananas
59:09
to you which trade as a secondary utility token. But I I want to challenge
59:15
you on this. Hold on. Let me let me The broader point I'm making is doing all of this with lawyers. The broader point I'm making is
59:22
or imagine not doing it at all. Let let me make my bigger point. My bigger point is as you get through this all of the
59:28
stuff that's happening, there's a there's a collective level of innovation at scale that's moving faster than
59:34
almost the AI world. It moved faster than anything I've ever seen before. It is absolutely profound. And when the
59:41
people kind of did an initial set of rug clothes, now when people issue NFTTS or issue tokens, you have to hold the token
59:47
for 6 months before you can sell it. And it evens out the the curves. There's all sorts of things happening at
59:53
unbelievable speed. The ecosystem is learning very very fast. And so there's something profound happening and
59:59
incredibly creative. What's even more interesting is it's democratized. So anybody with a great idea can show up
1:00:06
and do something and test it out and see where it goes. And so there's for that adds to the collective pool of of
1:00:12
ingenuity. Why I think why is why is these examples important? I think is because when I
1:00:20
send money into this contract, I have enough guarantees to know what happens
1:00:25
if in a catastrophic event. So I can actually go participate in this even if it's stupid. Even if I'm getting bananas
1:00:32
out of this like how many bananas do you own, Selena? Right. The fact that I can transfer and
1:00:37
transact and sell these bananas. I now have my risk outline is is very
1:00:43
different than if I had to do this blindly over eBay to send somebody a a
1:00:49
cashier's check to buy their wood and Ultima online. That's a very different type of risk involved there. So, the
1:00:55
chain eliminated a whole bunch of risk that was previously impossible to eliminate. And because of this, yeah, a
1:01:02
lot of this stuff is going to accelerate at the tail end, but the things that now
1:01:08
have an option to go use lawyers and go through the Figma IPO process through an
1:01:13
investment banking now have an alternative. So the price through the traditional processes is going to
1:01:18
collapse down to what's available on chain like and and right now you have this massive adverse selection problem
1:01:24
where if I am Figma, I don't need to go get onchain capital. I can go through
1:01:29
the investment banking process. I've been building this company for 10 years. All my lawyers are telling me minimize
1:01:34
risk. You're just going to do an IPO traditional way and you shouldn't think about any of these costs because that's
1:01:41
the last thing that you should try to innovate on. And that's hard for a CEO to make that decision. But that's going
1:01:48
to shift like I think and that's going to shift massively and quickly as you get to this trillion dollar stable coin
1:01:55
amount number and then the $10 trillion is going to be way past the shift I think.
1:02:01
Yeah. Now you're getting to the meat of where throw some throw some meat to Alex here. He'll eat it like a pitbull.
1:02:09
The you know you know Peter's question about okay I want to raise money for my company you know 5 million bucks. Why is
1:02:15
this so hard? But the assumption underneath that is that your company needs either some physical like iron and
1:02:22
something, but it doesn't anymore. What does it need? Well, all it needs is labor for the most part, any of these virtual companies. Well, why am I
1:02:28
raising $5 million? Why aren't I raising some virtual thing and paying those people? You know, if those people end up
1:02:35
being in Venezuela, Ethiopia, and Ukraine, they don't want US dollars
1:02:41
anyway. and the value if I put a value on their time you know which I have to
1:02:47
do legally in the US but I don't have to do across borders they don't want to be valued at something that's taxed so the
1:02:55
the economy of of you know AI just solved every math problem known to man
1:03:01
what's that worth is worth a lot okay well I'm not going to pay for it valued by a 49a valuation from an accounting
1:03:08
firm in the US and so that whole economy of trading AI I generated things with
1:03:13
other and even human labor is going to be completely outside the world of
1:03:19
normal valuations and normal payroll taxes and normal and because you don't have to value it in US dollars if you
1:03:26
don't want to and that's where the dam is going to break. I think even I think even if you value
1:03:32
them in US dollars and I actually think most markets will go through through US dollars the fact that you have two
1:03:39
alternative paths. I can use a safe and go to YC company and go through that process or I can buy a token in like an
1:03:46
ICO. And the difference with a token is I have immediate access to secondary markets. Both events are just as risky.
1:03:54
You're taking massive risk. And basically, is this founder a jackass or
1:03:59
not? Like it doesn't matter if it's a YC founder that's a jackass or an ICO founder that's a jackass, you're going
1:04:05
to get screwed either way. But the the guarantees you're getting out of out of
1:04:10
the safe is competing with the fact that I have secondary markets and this reliable execution and transfer.
1:04:17
So which one are you going to take as an investor? Like you you may not actually be able to get any money out in the
1:04:24
catastrophic event out of the safe or any value out of that event either way. Um and the success upside is the same in
1:04:31
both. Yeah. I think I think most governments think that, you know, regardless of all
1:04:39
the transactions you do on chain, sooner or later, you're going to want to turn that into either real estate or labor in
1:04:45
my country and you're going to come back through my regulatory framework, through my Treasury Department, through my SEC
1:04:51
to turn it into something that you can use to enjoy your life. And I think increasingly that is not true. it's
1:04:57
irrelevant because what you really wanted is either compute or you know
1:05:03
virtual entertainment or whatever and you can buy it outside of that regulatory framework with your Solana
1:05:08
and so that part of the economy today is not a big deal. I think that dam's going to break very quickly. And then that
1:05:14
part, it operates across borders frictionlessly. It operates in milliseconds and it operates entirely in
1:05:21
the virtual universe. And that economy will grow so much faster than the physical economies that it'll be it'll
1:05:28
go from, you know, a rounding error to dominant in just a few years. That's that's my guess.
1:05:33
If if you're in the US, you pay dollars market to mark to market to US dollars
1:05:39
in taxes. So even if you make your profit and soul, you have to market to market and cover your dollar exposure.
1:05:46
Otherwise, you're running a debt to the to the place that can collect it with
On-Chain Corporations & Law as Code
1:05:51
with a carrier ship full of F F35s or whatever.
1:05:57
That speaks to my original question, which is government and governance mostly doesn't live on chain right now.
1:06:04
So to to the extent that Peter, Dave, and and to some extent Salem are are are
1:06:10
aspirationally hoping that we're going to live in an utterly frictionless economy, it seems the elephant in the
1:06:15
room is that all of this physical government apparatus and the court system and jams and methods for
1:06:21
adjudication. These are all offchain. So I guess let me take it, Alex. Let me take it
1:06:27
there cuz this is the conversation we had with with Jeremy from Circle in which I was asking him when do you think
1:06:32
we're going to see the first fully onchain corporation, right? Where contracts, payments, treasury,
1:06:38
governance, and even all of the agents employed by that company are on the
1:06:43
blockchain, right? And we have the explosion of a a new corporate structure that's operating at light speed compared
1:06:50
to everything else. Do you imagine we're going to have that? When could we have that? I think you can go look at kind of the
1:06:58
the cool experiments in this would be metadowi
1:07:03
decision marketbased Dows where um you effectively every decision that this
1:07:10
coin does or this group that holds the coin is using a futary mechanism where
1:07:16
should we go invest in this or should we pay these engineers why? The way that these decisions market work is you're
1:07:22
basically saying if the market decides yes and I'm willing to buy your Metadow
1:07:27
tokens at price Y. So I'm willing to pay more for this for Apple stock if they go
1:07:34
and build uh you know iPhone 20 or whatever or but or if
1:07:42
does that make sense? This this is like the kind and I would say the the closest thing you're going to get to full
1:07:48
onchain governance and corporate control over funds and assets. Peter, I'd like
1:07:53
to try to answer your question, but but then forward a sub question to to Tobi, if I might.
1:07:59
I I think the answer to your question relies on a sub question, which is when will we see, at least within the US, the
1:08:06
first state government approve a new type of corporation that is an onchain autonomous corporation. It it require it
1:08:13
would be require an act of a state government at minimum. By some question, Texas, Texas or Florida? Yeah. Yeah,
1:08:24
go ahead. Get Wyoming's go for it. Wyoming's shown very advanced in uh
1:08:29
crypto adoption and acceptance. They actually issued a stable coin where
1:08:35
as you interpret the law because they're sovereign. They're neither a person or a corporation. And they they've issued a
1:08:43
stable coin under their own kind of regulatory scheme, which is uh interesting to think about.
1:08:49
But Puerto Rico, you know, Puerto Rico is inside the the realm of the F-35 circling around yet completely
1:08:56
independent from the federal government. That that's potentially a birthplace for this whole thing.
1:09:02
Well, today you can already Wait, wait, wait. Let's let's take this home. So So the the the sub question then
1:09:08
would be, okay, so so you have hypothetical preference for Wyoming, maybe Puerto Rico. When does this
1:09:14
happen? When do we see the first in in in your prediction to when do we see the
1:09:20
first state level government in the United States in enshrine in in statute the ability for an autonomous
1:09:26
corporation which by the way could be an AI as a person as well doesn't necessarily have to be an onchain entity
1:09:32
is this I'm not 100% sure but I thought there were DAO friendly bills already
1:09:38
being passed in Wyoming specifically for creating these kind of corporate
1:09:44
structures that um assign control or parts of the control of the fiduciary duties to a
1:09:51
dial. Yes, there are. We looked into this. Wyoming does allow that. The problem is you're still under the the federal
1:09:58
uh SEC issues. But I'll give you this thing in in Panama. There's a couple of other places where that you can have
1:10:05
foundations that create Dows and those are fully decentralized autonomous organizations and then everything can be
1:10:11
run from the DAO and the DAO owns everything. So it's really it's almost like a trust with digitized crypto
1:10:17
enabled transactions going through it. You actually don't need these things. I think the key part that you need out of
1:10:24
I think the federal in a government and laws is that um if you participate in
1:10:31
the smart contract that your liabilities are not co-mingled with everyone else that participates. This is kind of like
1:10:36
I think either needs to be passed through Congress through the market structure bill or kind of figured out in
1:10:43
the courts is that once that's true, the fact that like you can now participate
1:10:49
in these Dows and and things like that, those those effectively become code is law because if the government says that
1:10:56
your liabilities are limited, you're not part of this cohort, that you're responsible for everyone's actions that
1:11:02
participate in this in this mechanism, and the only thing that you have is the
1:11:07
code, then you are solely relying on the code to enforce all the decisions of
1:11:12
that thing. So if you if you go into it and you lose money, tough, right? Like you've actually taken on the risk and
1:11:18
there's nobody for you to go after anymore. So this it's more like I don't think we need laws to pass to allow it.
1:11:25
What we need is laws or courts to figure out that you don't have liabilities if
1:11:32
you participate in these systems and that's about it. See, I think you exist just by existing.
1:11:38
You you've put your your finger on I I think the the core issue for the future of this entire space, which is what does
1:11:43
the future of law as code look like? And I I think there are sort of maybe two directions, at least two directions I
1:11:50
can imagine it going in. One is I think what you're articulating, which is in the future, state plus federal law plus
1:11:57
a whole bunch of regulations get encoded in something that looks like, you know, future of layer 1 code. It's basically
1:12:05
software. There is another future where future of laws and regulations remain
1:12:10
pure natural language, but we have a whole constellation of AI agents that are interpreting them basically AI
1:12:16
lawyers, AI regulators. Do you have a sense of which of those two futures or
1:12:21
maybe door number three we're going to find ourselves in? Um,
1:12:26
I'll I'll answer that question. We start with number two which is you have AI agents dealing with natural language law
1:12:33
and then over time we have to develop completely new forms of mechanisms and governance structures to deal with it.
1:12:40
Well those will be on chain. What about you Tully? I think um humans
1:12:47
in the loop and kind of how our human egos are are designed is that you will
1:12:53
have uh this I think like the big short is this awesome scene where the higher
1:12:58
up the chain of command you go the dumber the person the the less they understand about what's happening.
1:13:05
The same applies to podcast hosts by the way. Yeah. Oh,
1:13:11
I think because of just human nature of politics and leadership and all these things, you're going to see the most
1:13:18
sophisticated understanding of how this stuff works at the lowest layer and then it go as the the higher up it goes to
1:13:25
the court system to politicians to regulators the more broad strokes they
1:13:30
have kind of to control it. Um, and my my view is like I don't think you're going to have AI agents in that spot
1:13:37
because of human ego. Like I think humans really really want or big orgs
1:13:42
under them. I just have to jump on that cuz cuz uh
1:13:48
I just think it's the coolest thing in the world that you as a as an individual engineer you know come into the country
1:13:56
14 years ago whatever settle in San Fran and invent a hundred billion dollar thing out of thin air. was created out
AI, Markets & the Next Decade of Intelligence
1:14:01
of thin air and then to figure out how it interacts with the government. A guy
1:14:07
David Saxs who has nothing to do with the government ends up in the role kind of overnight and now you guys figure it
1:14:13
out together. Show me any other country on the planet that could ever do that.
1:14:18
But it's exactly what you said from the big short. You get to any other jurisdiction and the the factor, you know, in the way makes it impossible
1:14:25
to to interact. It's just the coolest story. you know, hold on, hold on. This
1:14:32
isn't quite fair. If you take Switzerland, which has been crypto friendly for longer than almost anybody,
1:14:38
they passed legislation quite a long time ago and a huge number of the crypto founders moved there because it was so
1:14:44
crypto friendly. Japan is friendly. Now there's an increasing list of countries, Malta,
1:14:49
Likensstein, etc., etc. So, countries are jumping on board and a lot of the
1:14:55
Binance, etc., A lot of these were created in places where they were crypto friendly first and then they worried
1:15:00
about the US later. Uh the US has now jumped on the bandwagon in a big way which is fantastic but it's a little bit
1:15:06
too little too late for some things. I think in other areas it's going to really take off.
1:15:12
You know, Tony, when when you started Salana, aentic AI was not even in the conversation,
1:15:19
right? It was uh it was, you know, four or five years out, right? Just transformers and and I can
1:15:26
imagine that AI agents are going to be the single biggest uh you know
1:15:33
transactors of Salana. Can you can you speak to that? Um
1:15:38
yeah, I think um if we the the fact that
1:15:43
you can synthesize a lot of signal around the world through AI like the
1:15:48
amount of cost per intelligence goes down. What that means is you have an army of analysts that can understand all of the signal and synthesize it into
1:15:57
uh buy or sell right signal. You can now create a lot more markets. And I think
1:16:02
this is where I think stuff like Futarch can actually potentially become scalable to large organizations. Um
1:16:10
why like I think this is kind of sort of happening already is if you like look at me or Vitalik we're obviously not
1:16:17
business people like I have I'm not a bra business person that understands
1:16:22
you play you play a business person on TV. Yeah. Exactly. Like you're you're like
1:16:27
way too candid and and honestly he's a researcher. I'm an engineer like I understand how memory works and stuff
1:16:35
like this but just simply from this trustless coordination of of blockchain
1:16:42
the fact that you could own a part of soul and you could actually run the systems per participate in it that
1:16:50
actually creates enough incentive alignment for everyone in the ecosystem to move it towards a common goal. Like
1:16:56
even if each participant is rationally optimizing their own ENL under the hood,
1:17:02
they're maximally trying to just profit and sometimes in a zero sum way over other participants. But because it's all
1:17:08
cryptographically glued together into this one gen where if there's a bunch of
1:17:14
markets, it all makes money like that forces the forces everyone to move in
1:17:20
the same direction. I think that is an example of this class of new organizations that are not quite
1:17:26
corporations, not quite kind of single person small business, but an internet scalable system that's glued together
1:17:33
with cryptography that can all move together for a common benefit. I think
1:17:38
that's a very very unique cool thing. And as you have AI explode and the
1:17:45
ability to get uh analyze a whole bunch of signal into an action becomes cheaper and cheaper. I
1:17:52
think the number of markets that can support this decision-m is going to blow up and hopefully they all run on Salana
1:17:58
and that we make more money from making sure there's no spam. But that
1:18:03
Alex we'll see like you know Yeah. How many AI agents do you imagine
1:18:10
were going to be operating a decade from now? I don't think the question is going to be meaningful a decade from now because
1:18:16
I I think a agents is a very 2025 era term. I I think we'll look back 10 years
1:18:22
from now and laugh at at the premise of the question. You have like a continuous information
1:18:29
funnel to GPUs that's just constantly looping. Is it? Yeah. Like the question doesn't matter.
1:18:36
How many terowatts or paws of intelligence will we have a decade from now?
1:18:41
And and so we we currently measure AI in terms of uh of of energy, right? We're talking about gigawatt data centers and
1:18:47
so forth for the moment. For the moment for the moment. Are we going to start a new layer of uh of sort of measurement
1:18:54
which is a financial layer of measurement in terms of how much capital
1:18:59
is going to be is going to be transacting on these systems. uh because the speed I mean the most the most
1:19:06
valuable bits of information are in bits of information that carry financial
1:19:11
value with them right so uh but that's circular though like that that that's circular to say what's most
1:19:17
valuable is most financialized like ideally and and totally keep me honest on this I would hope 10 years from now
1:19:22
we're we're in a state where we've not just solved math but we've solved economics we we have like a a rigorous
1:19:28
science of what wealth is we have the beginnings of it today arguably But if you put 10 economists in a room and you
1:19:35
ask them like what is real wealth, you'll get maybe 20 different answers. I would hope we have actually like a
1:19:41
decade from now a notion of what real wealth is. Not just monetized wealth,
1:19:46
but actual wealth. And then we could actually trade real wealth. But to my knowledge, we don't know what real
1:19:52
wealth. Probably just energy. It's just jewels. Maybe not. Or I'll give you an alternative too,
1:19:58
which is transistor flips or flat. Well, flops isn't right, but but it's going to be some metric of compute that's more
1:20:04
foundational than the dollar or any concept of curren currency. Right now, we're all trained that wealth is dollars
1:20:11
and and there, you know, the foundation metric is dollars, but that's going to break very quickly and it'll be
1:20:18
something either either power, you know, electrical power, but I think more likely some metric of compute.
1:20:24
I'd like to I'd like to challenge all of this. Um you know we've had for the last few hundred years the main mode of
1:20:30
discourse in the world has been business commerce money right and we run the world on that and we floated off feudal
1:20:36
systems and now the power is in the power of money which is more liquid free flowing it'll funds good ideas etc etc
1:20:43
but we're moving moving over the last few decades from money to information a startup today is much more interested in
1:20:49
collecting data about its users and then we'll monetize it later Facebook maybe has done the best job of taking social
1:20:55
data and monetizing and it's fungeible. You can go back and forth. Over time though, uh the the information becomes
1:21:02
the harder bit and the monetary side becomes less relevant. And so I would think that over time you'll end up in a
1:21:08
Star Trek world where you don't have any money. You don't have any commerce. You're just doing things and it the the
1:21:13
the the cost of things becomes so meaningless. It doesn't m com the idea of commerce doesn't matter. So that
1:21:20
would be my challenge. I I'll challenge the challenge and and say that this this very much feels like a very uh October
1:21:27
2025 era discussion where we've seen large parts of the West de-industrialized for a couple of
1:21:33
decades and we're we're just taking it as an axiomatic truth. Oh well, like we're de-industrialized. So, of course,
1:21:41
it it's just about the bits. It's not about the atoms. But actually, the atoms are incredibly important. Uh, and and I
1:21:46
I would argue if I had to to choose my my favorite denomination of real wealth, it's it's going to be something embedded
1:21:52
in the physical world. Like I I've argued in the past something about future freedom of action. If we could quantify future freedom of action of
1:21:59
humanity that in yeah in cubits or or even classical bits like that that's the
1:22:04
closest I can come up with for a real definition of wealth. But I'd be curious to to like what's your best definition
1:22:10
of wealth? Uh, okay. I I'll give like a hot take. I
1:22:17
think it's like Shannon's law. How how much information we can process. Um, so like our channel capacity to
1:22:24
process information is real wealth. It'll be a measure of information. Yeah, I agree. It'll be measured in
1:22:31
units of information. Time out. I'm taking this in a different direction. So one of the things I'm concerned about right now given the
1:22:37
speed at which we're getting wealth aggregation into the large uh you know hyperscalers and given the fact that we
1:22:44
have uh not in the long term but in the short term I think a job dislocation is
1:22:50
that there's a lot of people really concerned about civic unrest right about
1:22:56
we had uh Bology on the pod talking about I would not want to be a tech entrepreneur in the Bay Area in 2 or 3
1:23:04
You guys remember that in terms of uh you know I have a few of my friends who in the VC world getting death threats
1:23:09
right now. It's crazy. I mean really really crazy. So my my question is how
1:23:16
are how can we potentially see Salana and the crypto world help ease this
1:23:23
tension that we're going to have of this discontinuity because I think in the long run to we have you know I all I
1:23:31
speak about and write books about is this world of abundance where we're demonetizing and democratizing access to food, water, energy, healthcare,
1:23:37
education. It's the interim state, right? the next two to eight years that I'm most concerned about. What are your
1:23:44
thoughts there? I I'm actually I kind of have a very opposite view of biology here.
1:23:51
Probably maybe because I don't know my parents came to the to United States from the USSR literally with $50 per
1:23:57
person like in '92. So I think what we're seeing with AI is a less a
1:24:04
smaller transformation in terms of labor than the steam engine. like the amount of people that actually became
1:24:09
unemployed because of the steam engine was dramatically more. And those were like all fighting age dudes. Like uh I I
1:24:17
think um the likely outcome is that you we just get better at what we do and the
1:24:25
jobs become less easier, less risky and you can scale up and the amount of wealth that you create for the world and
1:24:30
the poverty decreases and people just simply work less. And the difference between the kind of work that my dad had
1:24:38
to do as a civil engineer in the USSR versus here was like night and day in terms of risk like and that was just
1:24:45
moving across like the you know the Atlantic Ocean into like a more mature
1:24:50
economy. So I think the world is only going to get wealthier and we're blessed to live in this age. So I'm like very
1:24:56
optimistic. It's the most exciting time to be alive. Yeah, for Open AI is not shrinking its headcount. And this is the most advanced
1:25:02
AI company. Like they're they're not hiring less people. They're hiring really smart
1:25:09
people and giving them the best tools to accelerate that company. But that's only going to happen everywhere. I think
1:25:15
you're going to end up with a lot of demand for people that understand how AI works, where where it makes mistakes and
1:25:21
can course correct it and keep it on track. I think that that's probably going to be a super valuable skill. And
1:25:29
if anything, I think of that comes from experience. My experience with AI tools is that I can keep like half an open eye
1:25:36
watching cloud stream its code and know that it's doing something right or wrong. Whether like a junior engineer
1:25:42
has to actually analyze every commit and stuff like I think you you will see the
1:25:47
exact same kind of uh systems that you that you did with just advent of databases and computers. Like everyone
1:25:54
that was an accountant didn't just like become homeless. They just they're super smart people with college education that
1:26:00
are like have incredible access to networks that can go and retrain a lot
1:26:06
easier than I think everyone else. What's your take on this? Well, I think as you if if we have a
1:26:13
kind of a breakdown in society like you're talking about, right? What you end up happening is because it's so easy
1:26:20
to build a crypto system today, you could create a local community DAO that
1:26:25
circulates tokens just amongst itself and you can spend those tokens on certain things and very quickly boot up
1:26:31
a lo a local economy, right? Notice note that most monetary transactions 80% are
1:26:37
local. You're buying supplies, you're you're getting your haircut, whatever, whatever. Not the amount of money, but
1:26:43
the number of transactions. And so crypto because it's a strange example for you to use.
1:26:49
Sorry, it's a strange example for you to use. Get your hand. It is a strange example for for me to use. Um uh but so this becomes really
1:26:58
powerful to replace and and very this is why I believe that we're moving to we're going to move to very granular
1:27:04
environments where people will create small communities that self-support. This supports biology's network state
1:27:11
idea. we just need to keep enough to for the internet to keep going and everything's fine. If that breaks down
1:27:17
then you have major issues. But I remember this wonderful story in the 70s where there was a huge central banking
1:27:23
strike in Ireland and uh the there were just no checks getting cleared. No checks were getting cleared and for 2
1:27:29
years uh the Irish just kept going. They just kept passing checks around saying well when the central bank comes back
1:27:35
online it'll settle on. And two years later the central bank went wow nobody nobody's even noticed we're on strike.
1:27:40
we might as well come back because and then they cleared all the checks and then business went back to usual, right?
1:27:46
And so human beings are incredibly resilient at figuring things out and I think when we get into major issues like
1:27:52
that, we'll figure it out. Dave, I'm hugely biased cuz cuz totally
1:27:58
to me is the most perfect example of the person you want to be. Like after he's done with this podcast, he's going to go
1:28:03
debug some code. he's building it and and we're discussing like you know what does this AI philosopher who's never
1:28:09
done squat over here think of it and it's like it's like it's just like your perspective and especially when you come
1:28:15
from a foreign country you know I had the same conversation with Thomas Pedy who was born in Hungary in a basement as
1:28:21
the Soviet tanks were coming in and he he can't connect with his own kids who grew up here and they're like oh we're
1:28:28
destroying the world you know dad you're polluting by taking a dump and he's like
1:28:33
what are you talking about we live in the best time in world history and in the most free and fair place in the
1:28:40
world and you're not taking advantage of it like but but what to doing is actually building the future platform
1:28:47
from all of society and it's going to create the abundance that Peter is talking about and to me to me your
1:28:52
perspective is exactly the right one and I I'm not even vaguely connected to the alternate perspective makes no sense to
1:28:58
me but but everything you just said perfectly resonates with me I mean it's like it's exactly the right view.
1:29:04
Anyway, that's my that's my appreciate it. Yeah, you know, uh I I I am I am curious about
1:29:12
something. We've just seen Kazakhstan launch a stable coin on Salana um and
1:29:18
how do projects like that I mean does that get you excited? What projects are getting you excited right now about the
1:29:24
use of the technology you created? Because there might I mean you must wake up in the morning and say, "Holy that's amazing what someone just did
1:29:30
with Salana." Um, I think crypto is going through like
1:29:36
technology phases similar to the internet. You had the punks create the first version, then you had the hoodies
1:29:41
kind of scale it up and now the suits are moving in. So, a lot of the stuff
1:29:46
that's happening is driven by suits, which is great, but I'm less connected to that and more to I think the the
1:29:53
low-level experiment. So I think like folks if they really really want to kind
1:29:58
of be a bit deep in crypto, go check out Futarchy and decision markets and how to
1:30:04
run a collective like an online collective that makes real financial decisions but fully market-based. So in
1:30:12
a way that minimizes risk for investors, participants, etc. I think those kind of
1:30:17
things are like what I think are really really cool. And to me it's also kind of
1:30:22
a physics problem. Can we run a market for every, you know, for the top 10 million important decisions that people
1:30:29
make to make in the world every day? Just to drill into that, that would be that would be cool, right?
1:30:34
Yeah. Just to drill into that for a second, what Toby's talking about is Futarch allows you to use prediction
1:30:40
markets to do Dowo governance. Okay. And one of the big issues with Dows is how do you manage governance? Because it's
1:30:46
like you're in a town hall meeting with everybody shouting loudly. It's not quite combined with the worst dynamics of a meeting. It's not just Dow
1:30:53
Simone, right? It's not quite a prediction market. It's literally like if Apple said that, you
1:31:01
know, I I propose Apple builds this VR device and I'm willing to buy your Apple
1:31:06
stock for a higher price than it's currently trading because I'm so bullish on on this idea that the man that the
1:31:14
managers need to do. So, I'm willing to increase your value if you don't if you disagree with me. So, this in fact
1:31:22
forces a financial stake for any decision to be made in this in in this
1:31:28
DAO, which is different than let's all vote with our shares and say, "Yeah, we approve this or we not don't approve it
1:31:34
because you literally have to put your money where your mouth is for any decision that that this Dow takes."
1:31:39
Amazing. So, it's really really cool idea and they've run a couple ICOs that
1:31:47
have um have gotten like over $150 million in in in uh commits which is
1:31:53
pretty pretty crazy. Wow. Um I asked you a question, didn't hear
1:31:59
the answer though, but in terms of you know super exciting projects uh that that you're looking forward to on on
1:32:06
Salenum, anything you can share with us? Obviously, Salana Mobile, so go buy a Seeker if you don't have one. Uh, this
1:32:12
is Show it to us. Tell us about it. Tell us about the Seeker. Um, we have two goals. One, I think, is
1:32:18
uh because I spent most of my career at Qualcomm, it was just immediately obvious to me that you can have full
1:32:25
cryptographic guarantees that a hardware wallet provides in the phone form factor. Like in fact, all the technology
1:32:31
to implement a trust zone and to keep your secret keys stored in an enclave,
1:32:37
all that stuff was built years before Bitcoin for DRM of all things
1:32:43
to keep people from stealing like Netflix or whatever. Phones implement all this technology to to prevent any
1:32:50
kind of data snooping and maintain encryption from all the way from the deepest secure enclave to the display.
1:32:57
Um so it was just obvious to me oh why don't we embed hardware wallet directly into the phone. Um that was the idea so
1:33:05
we can make it as good of a from a security perspective like you get cold
1:33:11
wallets to wallet guarantees in your hardware device in terms of the kind of security that you get but the user
1:33:18
experience of Apple Pay so you get so you can have a hot wallet that is both secure and and great for consumers. That
1:33:24
was that's part of it. The other part of it is that you have these very mature companies like Google and Apple that
1:33:30
have a 20% rake on all digital spend at least through their economies.
1:33:35
And there's no it's it's just like that's a a bug in capitalism that just
1:33:40
doesn't make sense. Why isn't it converging down to the lowest cost? So to me it's an opportunity to use crypto
1:33:47
as a wedge because developers don't want to pay these fees. So we can use a different economics where you pay you
1:33:53
you we can earn I think as good of returns as Google or Apple but through effectively trading transaction fees
1:33:59
that are volume based protection. Solana a salana YouTube replacement like you know an Odyssey
1:34:06
equivalent on Salana. Uh there's people trying to build crypto-based content creation. Um none
1:34:13
of those I think have really taken off or proven out. I think that's that's a harder problem than I think software and
1:34:20
like kind of software experiences. Um just the amount of sheer content that
1:34:25
you need to generate to get that like 10% as good as like within like a margin
1:34:32
of error as entertaining as YouTube or Tik Tok is just astronomical. But I think with AI and Sora like you're going
1:34:37
to see that kind of change. It's just think about that's actually the the crux of my question. Does Sora 2 or whatever is
1:34:45
next change the math or not? Cuz yeah, you're totally right. I think so. But like you need like right
1:34:51
now it's not good enough and too expensive, but like you can see it in 5 years. Oh, this entertainment stream
1:34:57
that I'm getting, right? The infinite just of like of of stream of of entertainment is
1:35:03
going to be AI generated. And that's kind of a scary thought because I think
1:35:08
humans in the loop on what keeps us entertaining is probably an important part of our shared cultural experience.
1:35:15
But uh we'll see what happens. An amazing future ahead.
1:35:21
Gentlemen, I I'm I'm jealous of your seeker, Salem.
1:35:27
Um I'm moving I'm starting to move all my crypto onto it. And by the way, um, uh, totally my whole community wants to
1:35:34
move our NFT collection onto Salana. So awesome. I may ping you about that. Awesome.
1:35:40
Time for a closing question. Do I get one question, but I have one that I think the audience might really care
1:35:45
about. So So totally, uh, if the world moves all these transactions to Salana,
1:35:51
you know, because it's a thousand times faster than than Ethereum, which is a thousand times slower than Bitcoin. So
1:35:56
it's like it is like the engine for AI. Um, and the the fundamental use of the
1:36:02
Solana token is anti-PAP, right? It's a way to pay for your your transaction to get settled.
1:36:07
Is there any way to translate the value of Solana without giving investment advice? Uh, the the transaction volume of Salana
1:36:15
to the value of the Solana token. How what's the math that connects those two things? I think the transaction volume is less
1:36:21
important and what's more important is the opportunity cost of being late. So
1:36:27
the where the network actually makes more value like you as a block producer like you need soul to stake to be a
1:36:33
block producer because if you had no civil resistance you could create infinite blocks and that would
1:36:39
effectively spam the network to death. So you have some civil mechanism to prevent infinite block producers. So you
1:36:46
have some amount of percentage solely you stake that gives you x amount of percent blocks you can make. When you're
1:36:52
making blocks, people are paying you to be first in the block, to be first to
1:36:57
get access to this trade. So, the amount that they're willing to pay you is based on the opportunity cost of that of being
1:37:03
first. Right. Right. And so, so has anyone put together a blog or a white paper or something that says
1:37:09
like, well, yeah, B blocks probably has done the best job in terms of compiling all of this data and analyzing it into more
1:37:17
traditional this is revenue, these are network costs. So if you go to block works, you can look at Salana and
1:37:22
Ethereum and do comparisons. And this is true for all proof ofstake networks
1:37:28
because the civil mechanism for proof of stake is the token itself and you get
1:37:33
have x percentage stake. You can literally do I have a portfolio. Do I put a percentage of it into treasury
1:37:40
bills that are risk- free or do I risk some of it to run a block producer and
1:37:45
get like tips effectively for including transactions and it doesn't actually matter that you're getting tips in soul
1:37:51
or USDC or somebody gives you a sack of potatoes because the fact that you have
1:37:57
to stake x amount to get access to that revenue is how you can do your like Kelly optimized allocation. So this is
1:38:04
ties to you know the intelligent investor like a very traditional boring approach to do analysis here. Um you
1:38:12
can't do this for bitcoin because because the civil mechanism for bitcoin is energy and I don't know if it'll ever
1:38:19
change or anything like that. So I think Bitcoin is its own special snowflake that I have struggled to come up with a
1:38:26
standard model to analyze but for proof ofstake networks I think you can really put them in the um intelligent investor
1:38:33
box and do analysis and kind of make your own decisions. Alex want to give you a chance to ask a
1:38:38
question then I I have a question I go around the table uh to ask everybody. I'll ask a fun question uh not a serious
1:38:45
question. So, so totally let's project forward say humanity does in the end
1:38:51
take apart our solar system to build the Dyson swarm uh and we have lot lots of computium
1:38:57
what what will be the medium of commerce in in a Dyson swarm future for humanity
1:39:03
do you think that uh this is kind of like the central planning communism
1:39:09
problem is it computationally feasible to solve it uh just mathematically
1:39:15
without markets um at at relatively high latencies, right? You're you're bound by light speed
1:39:20
latencies just like we all are. I think this is this is kind of the question. How many cubits do we have to
1:39:26
be able to solve this like massive like linear algebra problem, right? Like can you allocate the resources to everything
1:39:33
and you might not need commerce. Then that might be the end of like capitalism and you might only have it just simply
1:39:39
for human entertainment. But um I think like personal freedoms are far more
1:39:45
important than efficiency in a lot of ways. So I would like I would go against I would be very much against it. I think
1:39:52
it's very important for people to have purpose and competing for tokens whatever they are right bananas out of a
1:39:59
memecoin or whatever. I think this this something. So here's here's my question for the
1:40:06
group. Go around the horn here. Um, you're you want to follow on Alex's
1:40:11
question from earlier, which is what's your definition of wealth in the future?
1:40:16
Sem, what do you think? Cuz it's very different looking back
1:40:22
historically at the kings and queens and pharaohs. It was, you know, how many how many slaves you owned than your ability
1:40:28
to, you know, sort of have access to agriculture was sort of wealth.
1:40:34
What do you think is in the future here? I would think it's a combination of time and health span.
1:40:39
Time and health span. Okay. Uh Dave, I think it's a no-brainer that it's
1:40:45
purely tied to compute because, you know, I was asking class at MIT the other day, like if I offered you $10,000
1:40:53
cash, here it is. Or a GPU that's worth $30,000. How many of you would take the GPU? And they're like, are you crazy?
1:41:00
I'll take the 10,000 cash. But in the in the near-term future, compute can be immediately turned into cash. I mean
1:41:07
there the the compute is the universal thing and and when you have AI agents who are the laborers of the world, the
1:41:14
your number of you know workers is the amount of compute that you have. So your
1:41:20
ability to make yourself happy whether it's controlling your figure robot, cleaning your house or building
1:41:25
something virtual or your customer, it's all bounded by the amount of compute you have access to. So that that becomes the
1:41:31
the universal and that that also determines your health. If you put your compute towards analyzing your scans, it
1:41:39
determines whether or not it finds your cancer and so it becomes your health too. So it becomes the universal
1:41:44
foundation. I compute your answer. Alex WG, what's your I think we're we're suffering from the
1:41:50
cliche of of the blind philosophers who are touching different parts of the elephant and and all overconfident that
1:41:56
the part of the elephant that they're feeling is what an elephant feels like. So, so I'd argue for a more general
1:42:01
definition that generalizes all of those definitions. I I would argue real wealth will be measured to first order as
1:42:08
future freedom of action, which generalizes compute. It generalizes physical resources. Uh it can be
1:42:15
measured in units of bits. So, it's an information theoretic definition, but it's not just about compute. It it's
1:42:21
about the ability, some might call it empowerment, but that that's a specialized term, to to take the course
1:42:27
of action you want in the future, not just in the present. I I knew I should The first time Alex said that to me, I I
1:42:34
didn't get it. And but if you go to alexw.org and you read his his paper on the topic and you
1:42:39
you read it closely, you'll come away saying, "Oh my god, he's totally right." Yeah. I I knew I should not I should
1:42:45
have degrees of freedom. Yeah, degrees of freedom. Yeah. It's the same thing. Yeah. you guys.
1:42:50
I should have gone before Alex went. I I'll I'll I'll I'll answer and then uh you know I think it's the ability to
1:42:57
fulfill your desires um your purpose and you know compute is part of it but
1:43:03
nanotechnology is going to be a fundamental as well of manipulation of the physical universe. So it's not just
1:43:09
compute um in that regard and and totally thinking in scarcity terms. You got to
1:43:14
jump forward to abundance terms and think then all that matters is time and health span. Hello.
1:43:20
I think you're you're thinking in meatbody terms. Think in post-biological terms. Come on.
1:43:26
All right. Uh anyway totally. So uh your your
1:43:32
answer here degrees of freedom. Degrees of freedom. All right. which is
1:43:38
like I think people will never feel satisfied because there's somebody else
1:43:43
that has more degrees of freedom than them. So this is like the human condition is always striving for
1:43:49
something else. The the hedonic treadmill spins faster and faster, doesn't it? Yeah. Yeah.
1:43:55
Yeah. I think you guys are right cuz you can have a lot of compute and still be beaten like a dog every day by some
1:44:01
government that Yeah. So you guys are right. All right. We've we've reached we've
1:44:07
reached a conclusion here. Uh Tuli, where do people find you? Um in the
1:44:12
world on Axe on Axe A Yakaveno. Um yeah, follow me on Axe. I have hot
1:44:20
takes, sometimes boring takes, I don't know. Love it. Love it. Or not. Yeah. Thank you for the work
1:44:26
that you're doing. Uh thank you for the future that you're enabling for so many globally around the world. Uh grateful.
1:44:33
The only time more exciting in today is tomorrow and uh it's going to be a woozy of a decade ahead. Moonshot mates, I
1:44:40
love you all. Thank you for today. Every week, my team and I study the top 10 technology metat trends that will
1:44:46
transform industries over the decade ahead. I cover trends ranging from humanoid robotics, AGI, and quantum
1:44:52
computing to transport, energy, longevity, and more. There's no fluff, only the most important stuff that
1:44:58
matters that impacts our lives, our companies, and our careers. If you want me to share these meta trends with you,
1:45:03
I write a newsletter twice a week, sending it out as a short two-minute read via email. And if you want to
