The "Post-Labor Enterprise"

Hey folks, David Shapiro here. Um, so I've been kicking around this idea of
0:06
what I call the post labor enterprise, which is an extension of post-labor
0:11
economics because here's the thing is some people out there are, you know, and
0:17
and to be fair, this is this is kind of a niche group. Um, I'm not going to say fringe because it's still a common
0:23
enough idea in the tech bro space like Silicon Valley and AI space where they
0:30
think that artificial intelligence is going to upend and rewrite the entire
0:35
economy. Now, uh, I tend to prefer to think of it as refactoring. Um, and the
0:41
and refactoring is still a tech bro term. And if you're not familiar with refactoring, refactoring is where you
0:48
rewrite software to achieve the same exact result, but with an an entirely different uh sometimes newer and better
0:54
method. Um, so if you fudge through a program the first time around, you kind of, you know, have spaghetti code and it
1:01
it's all messy and stuff, but then you get a new ability, whether it's a bigger server, more memory, more RAM, a better
1:08
database, or whatever else, or you even switch programming languages entirely, you rewrite your entire codebase with
1:14
all the lessons learned from the previous version, but you do it better. So it'll be faster, more efficient, more
1:20
robust, and that sort of thing. So I tend to think that artificial intelligence and robotics are going to
1:26
refactor the economy rather than upend it and rewrite it from scratch. And this
1:32
is what we call post-labor economics. And one of the primary things that we're
1:38
changing about the operating system is the need for labor.
1:43
And labor is uh so for the for the sake of of clarity and definitions, labor is
1:48
something that you pay humans to do. Um, the reason that you pay humans to do it is because until now only humans could
1:54
do it. So, for the sake of this show, this podcast, we're going to assume a
2:00
few things. Um, first, that artificial intelligence is going to continue on the
2:05
trend that it has been and that it's going to continue improving uh to the point that it is smarter than humans at
2:11
basically all cognitive tasks. Uh, that seems like a foregone conclusion, particularly in controlled environments.
2:18
Uh but it's also pretty good at improvising. Um some people out there are going to bulk at this idea like oh
2:24
well it can't it can't handle anything outside of its training distribution. But the thing is is that most humans
2:30
can't either. And certainly in a firm or an enterprise um very few things are
2:36
actually outside of training distribution. uh and and what I mean by that is that a human has has already
2:43
faced the problems that like 99.99% of the problems that you will face inside any firm someone else has already
2:50
figured out and anyways the science is showing that um that the that AI is now
2:56
able to generate novel insights even in science which you know uh the cutting edge of science is where there is you
3:03
know you'd have zero training data so um yeah so let's just for the sake of
3:08
argument, we're going to reject the idea that, you know, there's there's such novel unique tasks that uh AI has never
3:16
seen that businesses need to confront because certainly if you're in the research space, sure, but more and more
3:21
researchers are using AI to help them. So, the other thing, the other assumption that we're going to make is that humanoid robots are on the up and
3:28
up and that very soon humanoid robots will also be able to replace human
3:33
labor. they'll be better, faster, cheaper, and safer than human physical labor. Um, and that artificial
3:38
intelligence in the form of foundation models like transformers and language models will be better, faster, and
3:44
cheaper and safer than human brains. Um, so with those two assumptions, we can
3:50
make a third optional assumption, which is that even something like nuclear fusion might be coming down the
3:56
pipeline, which will basically make energy for all intents and purposes free compared to what it is today. Um, but we
4:03
don't even need to make that assumption. I'm just pointing out that that's a possibility. Now, even if you accept all
4:09
three of those assumptions, the reason that we call it post- labor economics and post- labor enterprise rather than
4:16
post scarcity is because it doesn't erase scarcity. Um, anyone with with a
4:21
uh even a mild education in business or economics will understand, okay, great. Even if you have cognitive
4:27
hyperabundance, even if you have labor hyperabundance, that doesn't erase all
4:33
the other inputs that go into your business. Um, so for instance, uh, one
4:38
of the first like principles, you know, tech bros love thinking in first principles. So one of the first
4:43
principles, economic constraints becomes physics. Time, mass, distance, and heat.
4:50
So time processes still take time. Mass has to do with the atoms that you want
4:56
and and how much they weigh and how many of them there are. Um so that's materials. And then distance, which is
5:03
logistics, getting stuff from A to B. Um whether that's moving energy around, whether it's moving goods around, um
5:09
getting raw materials and getting it to where it needs to go. Um and then finally, heat or energy. Um and you
5:15
still need to manage heat and energy even if you have a hyperabundance of it. Um you need to condition it. So here
5:22
here's a here's a perfect example. We have a hyperabundance of air, right? But even so, um you still need to make sure
5:29
that if you're using air in an industrial process, you need to filter it, you need to clean it, you need to condition it. Um so even when you have a
5:37
hyperabundant resource, that doesn't mean that it's readymade. Likewise, if you have a hyperabundance of heat from
5:42
nuclear fusion, that doesn't mean that it's immediately in the form and shape that you need it to be in. You might
5:48
need to have three-phase electricity. You might need to have two-phase electricity. You might need 480 volts.
5:54
You might need 120. You might need something else. Who knows? So, um that's
5:59
the premise. So, let's talk about the enterprise or or firms. So, um on a
6:07
broader perspective when you say like what's the what is the economy? What is the factor of productivity? Uh what is
6:13
the market? And so, uh it breaks down uh the the orthodox view is that it breaks down into four categories. land, labor,
6:20
capital, and entrepreneurship. And entrepreneurship is the organization itself, the risk-taking function. Um,
6:27
and also firms, one of the primary roles of a firm is, of course, the provision
6:32
of goods and services. That's the output. But one of the primary things that they do is risk management. And
6:38
we're going to talk about that in more in just a minute. Now land which is raw materials, physical space, uh any place
6:45
that you can perform extraction or storage and u of of capital that's not
6:50
going anywhere. That's that's always going to have a cost. And of course land is variable depending on how close it is
6:56
to um your producers, your suppliers, your consumers and so on. So even even
7:02
if we have unlimited labor and unlimited uh cognitive labor and unlimited energy,
7:08
land as an input is not going anywhere. Now factor number two, labor which is human input uh human effort uh and human
7:16
time that my argument is uh will be going away over the next uh few years uh
7:24
as as these technologies improve. And then capital, which is, you know, the money, the machinery, the
7:29
infrastructure, the investments, that's actually going to become even more important because guess what? All of
7:34
your AI chips and all of your robots and all of your nuclear fusion plants, those are capital. Um, so capital will become
7:41
even more important. So we're we're down to basically land and capital. And then entrepreneurship, which is the
7:46
risk-taking function. Um, that is that's actually that's actually several dimensions. So one is there's the legal
7:52
risk takingaking. One of the reasons that a firm exists is is to is for legal liability purposes.
7:59
Artificial intelligence won't change that at all. Um because when you when you are operating uh in a complex
8:07
civilization, someone needs to be on the hook. Which means even if the even if a company has zero employees, whoever owns
8:14
the company is going to be on the hook. So they're uh assuming the legal risk. But then there's the financial risk.
8:20
There's the there's the uh there's the you know the costbenefit analysis of
8:26
saying hey can we actually produce this good good or service at a profit yes or
8:32
no. Um and so then there's there's you know if they take out loans or whatever or if they have uh shareholders that
8:38
they have a fiduciary duty towards again artificial intelligence won't erase that. Although one of the primary uh
8:46
ideas here is that if we have super intelligent AI um that is better, faster, cheaper and safer than all
8:52
humans at all cognitive tasks that includes CEOs and boards and presidents and directors. Uh meaning that uh that
9:00
AI can can do all of the work, all of the labor of even running the business.
9:06
Um, but that doesn't erase the legal liability as well as the financial liability even if it would be a better
9:12
CEO than a human. So, you still have a human assuming behind it all the
9:18
financial and legal risk. U, but you don't you probably won't have a human CEO anymore. Um, it'll just be an AI CEO
9:26
reporting to the human owner. Um, so but that becomes just more capital. So through one lens you can say okay the
9:33
entire economy becomes land and capital labor and entrepreneurship mostly go away it just becomes more like land
9:40
capital and liability really. So that's one way to think of it. Um so then when
9:46
we look at the physical bottlenecks we say okay let's just take you know an example of steel or land. And so steel
9:53
is you know iron ore which is transmuted into uh into usable steel. You've got
9:59
lithium, lumber, silica, water. All of these are raw materials that uh still
10:05
take time and energy to produce and move. So that's the mass. So when we're looking at the physics bottleneck of
10:12
inputs, you've got mass, which is the materials and the land and that sort of thing. So that's atoms because some
10:18
people I've seen this comment out there where some people try and simplify it. It's like, oh, you're just rearranging atoms. Yes, but rearranging atoms is is
10:25
a non-trivial problem. When you look at for instance just the complexity of making uh uh wafers for for uh
10:33
processors um the the process of making silicon chips is so incredibly complex
10:39
that only a few companies in the world are capable of doing it. Um and so yes you're just you're quote just
10:46
rearranging atoms unquote but that doesn't make it easy. Um and so the process is is very difficult even if the
10:53
raw materials are abundant and cheap such as silicon. Now um so uh so supply
10:59
chains raw material extraction those become very important. So even just permission to extract resources, uh that
11:07
would that would increase competition, increase market competition because then if everyone and their brother is smart
11:13
enough to spin up a steel mill or a or a chip factory or whatever, uh then
11:19
everyone's going to want to do it, uh everyone with with any capital whatsoever is going to be able to say,
11:24
"Hey, I want to I want to set up a new factory or a new foundry or something like that." So that'll intensify
11:30
competition around mass which is you know land and materials. Then distance you know the logistics part um you know
11:37
it's not it's not just uh geographic distance but it's also last mile. So
11:44
there let's look at this from the macro scale and the micro scale. So distance still becomes an issue. One thing that I
11:51
that I personally think might happen is that labor arbitrage will collapse. meaning it's not going to be
11:57
economically viable to have um to have
12:02
your your your factories and your warehouses in Thailand and Vietnam and ship everything to America because that
12:10
time distance is going to be a lag when you can just have the same factories in America making the goods and services
12:17
that uh that are going to be sold locally. So you can you can beat the market if you set up local and sell
12:22
local. Uh now you might say okay well but what if energy is more expensive in America? I would say energy will
12:29
probably be cheaper in America because we're going to be the ones that can invest in that infrastructure. So
12:34
distance or logistics becomes an issue. But then also so that's that that was on the macro scale which is you know long
12:41
longdistance shipping and that sort of thing. In some cases you don't have a choice. So for instance, if you're
12:46
mining something like lithium uh or other rare earth metals or even pot ash,
12:52
right? Uh there's there's uh certain mines are going to produce goods in
12:57
certain places and you don't have an option. So in some cases you do have the arbitrage option. In other cases you
13:04
don't. It's simply the forest is here, the farm is there. Uh you know the the
13:09
sulfur is there, the lithium is over there. Uh so things are going to have a physical location which you can't argue
13:17
with. Um and it needs to get from there to somewhere else. Uh because you know for instance wherever your wherever your
13:24
your phosphorus mine is is probably not going to be where your farms are. Uh and anyways you need to sell it to a market.
13:30
So logistics isn't going anywhere. Even if we have autonomous trucks and drones
13:35
to handle the delivery in the last mile and all that stuff, you're still going to have the economic inputs of trains
13:41
and planes and boats, uh, which means that those are those resources aren't going anywhere. Um, it's just your your
13:48
your iPhone might say made in America rather than made in Foxcon, wherever Foxcon is, Thailand, Vietnam, China. And
13:55
then time, process latency. So everything still takes time. It takes
14:01
time to grow trees. It takes time to uh you know make those make those wafers
14:06
for the chips. It takes time uh for fabrication whether that's melting and and and mixing cooling. So there's
14:14
chemical processes, there's physical processes, there's thermal processes, there's biological processes. And yes,
14:20
in many cases throughout history, technology and science have allowed us to find new processes that are faster,
14:27
but few things are instantaneous. And also thermodynamics is kind of uh is
14:32
kind of a cruel mistress where you can't really argue with thermodynamics. If if it takes a certain amount of time for a
14:38
chemical reaction to happen, the time is the time. You cannot rush nature. So that's going to be something that you're
14:44
you're still going to be managing as as a dimension of risk as a firm in the future even if you have zero employees.
14:51
And then finally, heat or thermodynamics itself or energy more broadly. So that is that is going to be computation.
14:58
There's there's energy input um which is you know you you you basically take heat
15:03
and you use it to spin turbines to power the data center and then you have waste heat inside the data centers. Then you
15:09
have manufacturing which is everything from you know drills and and screws to
15:15
melting and smelting. All of that generates waste heat. Um it also requires thermal inputs uh or other
15:21
energy inputs. dissipating it, applying it, managing it, conditioning it, all of
15:27
that is still going to be uh again, you can't overwrite physics, not even with
15:32
advanced AI and and robots. So that's and also by the way, that's
15:39
just a first principles. That's just a physics-based first principles look at what remains scarce and economically
15:45
valuable in the future. That's not even talking about the regulation, the financial aspect, the uh, you know,
15:52
which is, you know, the stock market, your your your banks, your debt, uh, your credit, all of that other stuff.
15:59
Uh, legal legal risk, um, permissions, you know, license to drill, uh, those
16:05
sorts of things. All of those are are are, I guess you could say, second second order consequences, but still
16:11
first principles of doing business. None of that's going anywhere uh with artificial intelligence and robotics.
16:17
The AI might be a better lawyer, but you're still going to need to argue the law. So then you say, okay, well, what
16:23
does what does the firm actually have that that is valuable? Because if if basically what we're arguing is that
16:30
tribal knowledge and specialized knowledge goes away as a moat. So physical infrastructure is is going to
16:37
be a big thing which is who owns the robots, who owns the data centers, who owns the factories, uh those sorts of
16:44
things that is going to become a new deep moat for many uh for many companies. And this is by the way this
16:50
is going to apply to more than just tech companies. Um if if your business is software, your margins are going to get
16:57
razor thin because guess what? Everyone is going to be able to produce software. Uh however, if you own physical
17:03
infrastructure, if you own the data center, if you own the fields, if you own the mine, if you own the railroads
17:08
or or at least the the rail cars uh and the ships, you're going to have a much deeper moat just for the fact that those
17:15
again looking at the first principles, those things are big and heavy and required a lot of heat to manufacture.
17:22
Resource access is going to be another thing. So, who has the most secure contracts uh or licenses or permission
17:28
for those raw materials? Um where where do you have permission to operate your data center? Um so, that's going to be
17:35
something that's going to be really valuable because you know, one of the things that that that goes into whether
17:40
it's a factory or a ship or a foundry um or a data center is it requires a lot of
17:45
permission to even make those things. So even if you ignore natural resources and
17:51
extraction for a minute, the permission to build those those valuable resources, those capital assets is still going to
17:57
be something that's very valuable. And someone who has the the capital, the wherewithal, the intelligence to do all
18:04
that. Now, of course, you're going to have AI that'll help you. Like I could I could stop right now and just ask Gemini
18:09
or Chad GPT like, "Hey, I've got a billion dollars." And it's going to believe me because the AI, you know,
18:15
takes the user credibly. It's like, "I have a billion dollars. I want to build a data center. Help me find the best place to build a data center so I can
18:21
capitalize on artificial intelligence. It'll help me do that. Um, now you might say, well, don't don't trust it at face
18:28
value, which of course right now is true. Um, so you you give that same problem to every AI chatbot you have
18:34
access to and then you mle it over to make a better decision. But in a couple years when you give that you know that
18:40
that query to chat GPT6 or 7 and you give that query to Gemini 4 um the
18:47
answer that it gives you will probably be the best answer assuming that you gave it adequate context. So physical
18:53
infrastructure resource access those are two of the first pillars of corporate value in the future. logistics. Um, so
19:01
you know, this this the ability to shorten time that I already mentioned. Can you get the raw material to the
19:08
consumer faster? Uh, that's going to be that's going to be uh hugely valuable in the future. Um, now in some cases that
19:15
might mean colllocation uh the manufacturer and consumption, but in some cases it's not. In some cases, it's
19:22
still going to go down to good old-fashioned rails, sales, and planes. I guess we don't use sales anymore, but
19:28
you get the idea. Um, trains, boats, and airplanes. Those aren't going anywhere.
19:34
Uh, and then finally, something that might be really valuable is the proprietary artificial intelligence and
19:39
robots. You might have something that is, you know, your off-the-shelf AI and robots might not be good enough for your
19:46
specific job. Uh, so if you do have proprietary AI or proprietary data or
19:51
proprietary robots, that could also be a really big moat. Now you might say, "Okay, I'm following
19:58
along, but so what? What's the practical takeaway here?" Now the the practical
20:03
takeaway um I my current working hypothesis is that it comes from Ronald
20:08
Kos's and I'm I don't know if I'm saying that right. It's co a s e ronald co or co um his theory of the firm which I
20:16
think he wrote in the 1930s. It's this is a pretty old idea. uh basically said that that the
20:22
boundaries of a firm are for internalizing transaction costs. So
20:30
basically the idea is whenever you can do something more efficiently inside of a firm boundary or inside of a
20:36
corporation you should do it otherwise you should just buy that good or service from the market. Uh so in that case when
20:43
we look at vertical integration this vertical integration is one of the consequences of this idea. Now one guy
20:51
who takes vertical integration to the nth degree is Elon Musk with things like Tesla and SpaceX. So, the idea is that
20:59
rather than buying all of your your bespoke Tesla parts from a Tesla supplier and the supplier exists only to
21:05
serve Tesla or only to serve SpaceX, that doesn't make any sense because they're they're taking their transaction
21:11
fees. Um, you know, they've got the middleman. You know, that company that you're buying from has a profit motive.
21:17
So, rather than contracting out someone to build this the Raptor engines, they internalized it. And arguably you can
21:23
say the Raptor engine is the thing that makes SpaceX different because their rockets are braindead simple. They're
21:30
just stainless steel tubes, but it's the Raptor engine that that and all of the inputs that go into the Raptor engine
21:36
that really differentiates SpaceX. Now, you can say there's also the software control plane. Um, but again, like he
21:43
used Tesla motors for the control surfaces. There's nothing super exotic there. And um even hobbyists have been
21:50
able to recreate uh self-landing rockets. Now um so the software the
21:55
physics none of that is a moat but if you look again those the rearranging
22:00
atoms can be really difficult in designing really good rocket engines that is that is a deeper moat. So and of
22:07
course now also SpaceX has permission to launch. So that's another that's another part of their moat. So that vertical
22:12
integration has reduced their labor cost and reduced their their their material costs. Now, based on the premise we're
22:19
outlining that in the future, artificial intelligence and robotics basically erases labor costs. For all intents and
22:26
purposes, labor is no longer a primary input to business. So then you say, okay, well, uh, the reason for most
22:34
outsourcing disappears when AI and robotics eliminate labor costs. any
22:39
reason that you would have outsourced to a contractor or a subcontractor if the
22:44
labor was was one of the reasons you say, "Okay, I'm going to let someone else manage the labor so that I can just
22:51
focus on my business." That doesn't make sense anymore. So, the friction for internalizing whatever it is that you
22:57
outsourced goes away. Then when AI is superhuman intelligence and possesses
23:05
all specialized knowledge or can generate any specialized knowledge then outsourcing to someone else for their
23:11
their expertise saying ah you know like let's just say for instance I wanted to buy Raptor engines and it's like well I
23:18
don't have the expertise to make or design Raptor engines so I'm just going to buy them from SpaceX. I know they're
23:23
probably never going to sell them because it's like that's their that's their their cash cow, but just as an
23:28
example, because the Raptor engine is the best rocket engine on the planet right now. If I wanted to buy them, I
23:34
couldn't. But in about 5 to 10 years, artificial intelligence will be able to design a better Raptor engine in 5
23:41
minutes. So then specialized tribal knowledge is no longer a moat either. So
23:47
the firm boundary and one of the best ways to understand the firm boundary is do I do it myself? Do I make it or do I
23:53
buy it internal or external. So it's no longer determined by labor management or
23:58
knowledge gaps. It is it is then entirely almost entirely determined by capital
24:04
and physics. Now here's an example. Here's a thought experiment. Uh SpaceX
24:09
versus Apple. So SpaceX has uh decided to internalize. So there's, you know, I
24:18
disagree with some of these assessments that say like there's no market for Raptor engines. There is a huge market for Raptor engines, but it is much more
24:26
efficient and and and potent for SpaceX to have their own to have their bespoke
24:33
uh their own internal supplier for Raptor engines. Now if if the space
24:39
industry were to proliferate, you might have a market for for space engines or
24:45
space engines rocket engines uh but right now the most efficient thing that they can do is defend their moat by
24:51
saying hey we are going to do this internally and and be our own supplier. Now, that
24:59
was was a defensive move. And of course, SpaceX is going to continue to do to do that until such a time that someone else
25:06
can just make off-the-shelf Raptor engines that are better and cheaper than what they can do internally. Um, because
25:13
if they can't do it better internally, either due to economies of scale or or that sort of thing. Now, that that's
25:18
another thing. Economies of scale are still a really big reason for firms to exist. Now, let's talk about that and
25:26
let's compare SpaceX to Apple. Apple famously still uses Foxcon to
25:32
produce all of their iPhones. Now, you might say, "Ah, well, this is a perfect example because iPhones, the only the
25:39
only uh uh supplier for iPhones is Foxcon, and the only purchaser of
25:44
iPhones is Apple for them to resell. So why don't they internalize that so that
25:50
they can uh so that they can cut out the middleman and cut out rentse seeeking behavior. The primary reason and this
25:56
this was surprising to me as I was doing research. The primary reason is risk is
26:01
capital risk. Apple does not want to own billions of dollars of factories that must be
26:07
retoled every 12 months that only produce one thing. Instead, the flexibility that f that Foxcon offer
26:15
offers because of their economies of scale means that they produce
26:21
uh goods and services or primarily goods their services assembly for Dell, Sony,
26:26
Amazon, Samsung, everyone else. The factory itself is the economy of scale.
26:32
So even in this hypothetical future, Apple will probably still outsource the
26:37
production of its iPhones because it's it's a standardized commodity and they want to be able to produce it at scale.
26:44
So instead of owning all the capital internally, Foxcon, which will be using
26:49
the same artificial intelligence and robots and eventually nuclear fusion, will still probably be able to produce
26:55
iPhones cheaper than Apple could simply due to economies of scale. Meaning that
27:01
even in a post-labor world, Foxcon probably still exists. And there's probably still a very good reason to
27:08
have that firm boundary. And when I mean firm as in like corporation, the corporate boundary between Foxcon and
27:15
Apple because what Foxcon is fundamentally doing is not just the economy of scale. It is also
27:20
amateurizing or redistributing risk. it is managing risk by distributing it over
27:27
multiple uh uh purchasers of the the devices that they make. The now I could
27:33
see the same thing happening to the rocket engine market in the future particularly as more nations and more
27:39
companies want to shoot stuff into space. SpaceX their moat might just be economies of scale to produce Raptor
27:46
engines at scale. Uh now of course right now they have launch permission um which
27:52
is itself a very very deep mode getting FAA approval and you know launching from
27:57
Texas and wherever else they launch from. I think they mostly launch from Texas now. Anyways so you get the idea.
28:04
So the the capital risk uh and an economy of scale is a is still a very
28:09
interesting reason to keep uh to keep firm boundaries in a post labor world.
28:16
Now, uh, so outlining that it would still be economically rational for Apple to buy their iPhones from, uh, Fox Con
28:24
is is is, uh, okay, I've made the point. Moving on.
28:29
Now, so when we say when we look at that, what we're looking at, let's just let's just keep the the Fox Con model is
28:37
what they're offering, the service that they are offering is not just saying, "Hey, we'll produce your goods for you."
28:43
What they're really offering is rapid retooling because that's their specialty. They have they have the infrastructure, right? They have the
28:49
capital to say, "Oh, hey, you know, we we have this factory. We have all the
28:55
tools, all the all the industrial processes, all the equipment, which means we can make any number of
29:02
electronics. Just ask and we can scale up production." So, rapid retooling and
29:07
risk management are really the services that Foxcon will be offering. um that well it's what they're already offering
29:13
but that it will be their primary service offering in the future. Now wherever the Foxcon factory happens to
29:20
be that might change. So for instance um you might you might move the factory
29:26
closer to the consumers uh and when you look at the fact that America is a gigantic consumer of these of uh you
29:33
know things like iPhones and and Sony uh devices and that sort of thing. You
29:39
might colllocate it with the chip fabs that are going up in America as well. So that'll cut down on transit costs.
29:47
But that's a strategic decision for Foxcon to make. Um but what they're
29:52
really offering the service is risk management via capital absorption. Um so
29:57
Apple's just as an example to differentiate cap the Apple's core competency. There we go that was a
30:03
tongue twister is design marketing and ecosystem management. Um it's going to want to deploy its capital on R&D and
30:10
brand building not on $50 billion factories um that are going to be obsolete. That is Foxcon's risk. Foxcon
30:18
is managing the risk. um and creating a a partition there. Now, it would the
30:24
thing the thing is if Foxcon only produced iPhones, then that would not be rational. Then it's like, okay, well,
30:31
Foxcon is just going to pass the costs of that of managing that risk on to Apple. So, Apple might as well absorb
30:38
Foxcon, but Foxcon produces uh goods for many companies. and then rapid retooling
30:45
that flexibility by by distributing the risk across multiple big clients and
30:51
also reusing that capital that they have because here's the thing if Apple owned its own factories then those factories
30:58
would just do one thing and they would need to retool which means that they're they're actually not able to benefit
31:04
from the economies of scale. Um, here's an example. iPhone sales versus
31:09
PlayStation sales, um, or Microsoft servers or Google Pixel phones or Samsung phones. By being able to
31:18
manufacture all of those, they're able to reuse not only their physical capital
31:23
um, internally, but also their logistics lines because guess what? iPhones and
31:28
PlayStations and Google Google phones and Samsung phones, they're all more or less being sold in the same markets. So
31:34
that is where the efficiency comes from. So this is where you see like okay you
31:41
can you can now now that you have a model for this this is going to be the same thing as like TSMC or AWS uh scaled
31:49
out more broadly. So TSMC produces the chips for Apple, Nvidia uh or rather
31:57
they they provide they provide chips that are used everywhere. That's what I'm trying to say. They provide chips that are used everywhere. though it
32:03
doesn't make sense for any of them to to make their own chips end to end. See what I mean? Likewise, AWS rather than
32:12
build their own servers and their own GPUs, what they're primarily doing is offering inference. They're offering
32:18
data. They're offering uh the actual compute. So, you can say that they're compute as a service or what we would
32:25
just call cloud services today. Um for them, they just want the servers as
32:30
cheaply as possible. They want the hard drives as cheaply as possible. They want the networks as cheaply as possible. So
32:36
even though they are a prime consumer of networking equipment and and data center equipment and even data centers, um it
32:42
makes them it makes sense for them to own the data center but then to stuff it with gear that is built by other people.
32:49
So that has been a lesson in the post labor enterprise. I hope this makes sense to you and thank you for listening
32:56
to the very end. Um yeah, stay tuned for more and we will keep talking. Cheers.
