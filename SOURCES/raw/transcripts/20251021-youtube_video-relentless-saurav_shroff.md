**Ti:** Do you want to just start off with what are the inputs to basically making a self-sustaining city on Mars?

**Saurav:** Yeah, well, first of all, thanks for coming. So there are basically two machines that you want to make to start to make life multiplanetary on Mars. The first machine is a fully and rapidly reusable rocket. This is a rocket that can fly and refly like an airplane where the primary expense in operating the rocket is fuel and the secondary expense is refurbishment or maintenance. But the primary expense is not building the rocket. This is important because if you don't make a fully and rapidly reusable rocket the unit economics of transporting cargo and crew to the surface of Mars will be far too expensive.

The second machine that you need to make doesn't necessarily meet the eye. It's not necessarily as obvious. It's a rocket propellant production plant on Mars. This is because it is physically impossible to make a rocket that can fly from Earth to Mars and back without refueling on Mars. Now, if you make a rocket that can fly to Mars but can't get back, the journey is both costly and morbid, so nobody will go. And so you need to make a rocket propellant production plant on Mars.

It turns out that if you sketch out a city on Mars in any way, if you imagine it with a few people or a lot of people, a short stay time or a long stay time, whatever scenario you envision, that city will spend 90 to 95% of its power producing rocket propellant. So the rocket propellant production plant on Mars can really be thought of as the second most important piece of infrastructure you need to build a city on Mars and the core engine that makes the city on Mars run.

**Ti:** So can you basically go into the math on how the 95% works out?

**Saurav:** It's a super shocking fact upfront, but basically, first of all the question is how do you make rocket propellants? For a vehicle like Starship, the vehicle consumes oxygen and methane. In a rocket engine the oxygen and methane burn to produce energy in the form of heat, CO2, and water. The rocket propellant production plant on Mars ingests water which is in the Martian crust and CO2 which makes up the majority of the Martian atmosphere, and adds power via solar energy to turn that CO2 and water back into methane and oxygen.

So the rocket propellant production plant in simple terms can be thought of as the opposite of a rocket engine—an inverse rocket engine. A rocket engine is approximately speaking the most energetic device, roughly short of a nuclear fusion reactor or a grenade. But even a grenade is pretty low energy compared to 33 rocket engines on the bottom of a rocket. So a rocket engine is the most energetic thing that the human species has ever made. What we need to do is go to Mars and build a machine that does the opposite.

So now you can start to picture why 95% of the energy we produce on Mars will be spent on rocket propellant production. It's because you're undoing the most energetic thing that humans really do ever. And what Starpath is building is the machines that make that possible and make it possible at unit economics that make the cost of a round trip to Mars a price that a middle-class American can afford.

**Ti:** How does that work?

**Saurav:** At a chemistry level, the production of rocket fuel on Mars is extremely simple. It's like high school level chemistry. What you do is take dirt out of the ground that has water in it. You heat up the dirt to extract the water as pure water with no dirt in it. You then take the water and you split it into oxygen and hydrogen. Rocket fuel is oxygen and methane. So we now have the oxygen component, and to produce the methane component, you react the hydrogen from splitting water with the CO2 that is abundant in the Martian atmosphere to produce methane. That reaction actually releases a little bit of energy which feeds back into the process. From a chemistry standpoint, it's super simple.

In fact, high schoolers will remember doing something in their high school chemistry class like putting a nail in a bucket of water and seeing bubbles form. That's water electrolysis, which is just extremely low efficiency. From a robotic implementation standpoint, that process breaks down into three machines. One machine generates power—in the early days with solar energy, and in the long term with nuclear. The second machine ingests dirt that's mined and does the chemical reaction I just described. And then the third machine is a mobile robot that drives around the surface of Mars and digs up huge amounts of dirt as raw feedstock for this process.

We're designing all three of those machines to be produced at massive scale. For context, we built the lowest cost, fastest driving, and highest performance moon or Mars rover ever made. In a few years time we'll build a factory that can make thousands of them every year.

**Ti:** Previously, how much does a Mars rover cost for NASA to build?

**Saurav:** It's a good question. There are a lot of NASA rovers that have been built in the past. None of them have been made for under 100 million dollars and many of them have been made for over 500 million dollars.

**Ti:** Importantly, does that include the cost to launch them to Mars?

**Saurav:** No, that number does not include the cost to launch them to Mars. For context, I'm referencing both rovers that NASA has made for the moon and for Mars. NASA has built a ton of really impressive science machines—machines that are optimized to do 50 disjoint experiments on water concentration, mineral type, soil type, various questions that scientists around the world have been asking. But what NASA has never done is ask themselves, okay, how cheap can I get the unit cost of water on Mars and subsequently how cheap can I get the unit cost of propellant? This question is only relevant when your objective is to make life multiplanetary. It's a totally irrelevant question for the objectives that NASA has admirably chased over the past three decades, which is to advance science.

In the past, the number has been hundreds of millions of dollars to build rovers. If NASA were to build a second or third version of that rover, it would still cost them tens of millions of dollars. At Starpath, we're building rovers for the low hundreds of thousands of dollars. So we're talking about an over 100x cost reduction. That's driven by vertical integration of all of the components that make the rover costly to manufacture and a design that's designed around mass production.

**Ti:** You mentioned that you basically set out to build propellant production and then suddenly you ran into the situation where the cost of solar panels—like the ones you have in the background here—they're orders of magnitude more than you really need them to be. How did you decide to basically go from just propellant production to now building solar panels?

**Saurav:** Yeah, it's a great question. The real realization is that the bottleneck is not the production plant. The bottleneck is the power. You can't make propellant unless you have power. And so we asked ourselves, okay, what's the cheapest power? And we looked at solar. On Earth, solar panels cost like 44 cents per watt. But when you go to buy solar panels for satellites, they cost like 1,000 dollars per watt. That's like a 2,000x markup. That's absolutely insane.

And when we started thinking about building a propellant production plant on Mars, we realized that not only would we need the propellant production plant, we would also need to make solar panels to power the propellant production plant. So we decided to get in the business of making solar panels. We're working hard to get the cost down to something closer to what you buy on Earth, and then deploy it on Mars. That's what we're doing.

**Ti:** How much of a cost difference is there going to be? Like is it going to be an order of magnitude cheaper, half the cost?

**Saurav:** It's definitely going to be at least an order of magnitude cheaper because the inputs to making solar panels are dirt cheap. The silicon feedstock, the glass, the metals. They're all really cheap. You can get all of that for maybe 50 cents per watt if you're smart about it. The expensive part is the labor, the supply chain, the regulatory overhead, all of that stuff. On Mars, you don't have any of those problems. You just have a factory, and you're making solar panels.

**Ti:** And are you going to be selling these to satellite companies?

**Saurav:** Yeah, that's the plan. Satellite companies spend an enormous amount of money on power because they're in this isolated environment where they can't get more power. They have to make do with the power that they have, and solar panels are incredibly expensive. Once we bring the cost down, we think satellite companies will be very interested in buying them.

**Ti:** How many rovers are you building first?

**Saurav:** We're building 10 rovers for our first mission to Mars.

**Ti:** Wait, so you're going to launch these rovers to Mars before SpaceX even has people there?

**Saurav:** Exactly. We're going to launch rovers to Mars to set up the infrastructure before people arrive. We need to build the propellant production plant, the solar panel array, all of the equipment that humans will need when they get there. And we're going to do that with these rovers. So yes, we're going to launch 10 rovers to Mars before humans arrive.

**Ti:** How much did the cost of Rover one versus Rover two? What was the difference? A few hundred bucks or a few thousand?

**Saurav:** Rovers one through five were all built in like under eight weeks each and all cost under 15,000 dollars. I mean, we're just going as fast as we possibly can to understand what shape works, what material works. If I put the wheel outside of the axis of steering, does the wheel bend inwards or outwards? We were basically just on an exercise of how quickly can we learn about what it takes to make a robot and where the actual limits are.

Then with rover seven onwards we started actually trying to build a machine that would work in space. Rovers eight, nine, and ten were all progressive steps. Rover eight worked in a vacuum, sort of theoretically. Rover nine was a little bit better and actually sealed against dust. And now Rover ten is our first rover that came out of what we call a thermal vacuum test [^1], which is sort of like the graduation exam for a moon rover.

It's a thermal vacuum test where you put a robot in a big chamber that simulates the conditions of various planets. Our test was for the moon. You evaluate whether or not a robot breaks, and thank god Rover ten doesn't break. But also you check if your model of how it behaves thermally and mechanically is correct. From Rover one to ten it's like two and a half years. It cost us no more than I'd say at least ten times less than you'd think.

**Ti:** What is TVAC?

**Saurav:** TVAC stands for Thermal Vacuum. It's the thermal vacuum test. It's a big chamber that simulates the conditions of a planet. It's like the final test that you put a robot through to figure out if it works.

**Ti:** And now you're building Rover eleven, which is even better than Rover ten in a bunch of different ways?

**Saurav:** Exactly. Rover eleven will be finished early next year. And now we're building Rover eleven, which is even better than Rover ten. It's easier to produce, it's more robust, it's faster, etc.

**Ti:** For Rovers one through ten, I know that you were testing them in like a thermal vacuum chamber. Were you also going out and if they're going to be collecting a bunch of basically dirt, are you going out to a desert to have them collect dirt? How did you test them?

**Saurav:** Yeah, it's a great question. So right here where you're sitting, if you look behind you, you can see scuff marks in the concrete. That's because right here there used to be a 25 ton pit of semi-cemented concrete. We would drive the rover into the pit, mine stuff, and evaluate how well it worked. Eventually, we got rid of the pit because it was sort of a safety hazard. Every time the rover mines stuff it releases huge clouds of dust that are lifespan shortening to breathe in. We removed it.

Now we do more scientific testing now that we've got the mining portion down. For Rover ten, we actually put a slab of that same concrete in a thermal vacuum chamber. So it was not just mining, but it was mining while super cold and in a vacuum, basically under the simulated conditions of actually mining on the moon. Back during the Rover one days we had literally a sandbox in our office. People would come over and ask, "Is this the play pen for engineers?" It was not a play pen. I do not recommend a sandbox in your office. But we would use that to test driving capability, mining capability. Super crude. Really basic stuff like, does this shape work? Does that shape not work?

**Ti:** And now you've kind of elevated to the scientific level where you calibrate the strength of the material and put it in a vacuum?

**Saurav:** It's arguably more boring nowadays, but you have to do the science to get it right.

**Ti:** So how do you get the best simulated soil composition of Mars soil on Earth?

**Saurav:** Yeah, this is a super long question to answer. The short answer is you make some guesses and you take the worst possible case. There are like between 50 and 100 research papers on this and they're all kind of the same in that they provide guesses as to what Martian soil might be, with ranges of values. We've taken all the literature, read it, and we know that the Martian soil is probably softer than soil on the moon. What we've done is taken everything we've read and created simulated Martian soil here on Earth. We test our rovers against it.

**Ti:** What if SpaceX didn't exist?

**Saurav:** That's an interesting question. If SpaceX didn't exist, I think we would just be focused on making some other rocket company successful or we would be working for NASA or the government. I think the fact that SpaceX exists and is openly ambitious about Mars is a huge inspiration. It's a huge inspiration to us. SpaceX has the best engineering culture of any company that I know of. I have a lot of respect for what they're doing.

But here's the thing: SpaceX will tell you that they're going to fly Starships back from Mars. I don't know what date they're talking about these days. Our goal is to make that possible at least four years sooner than they're expecting. So we're not competitive with SpaceX. We're complementary with SpaceX. And that's the relationship we want to have.

**Ti:** And so how are you guys able to do that?

**Saurav:** Yeah, it's a great question. Starpath's primary objective is to make it possible to fly Starships back from Mars to Earth by building propellant production plants on the surface of Mars. The bulk of the challenge is that your rocket on Mars needs 2,000 tons of propellant. The current production rate of propellant on Mars is squarely zero. You have to get from zero to two billion grams, and you have to do it in just a matter of a few days or a few weeks. So that's the bulk of the challenge, and that's what the products that we build solve.

**Ti:** Why is it important to you to basically make life multiplanetary and be a part of that journey?

**Saurav:** I think this is the most important question. There are two angles to think about it: the first is philosophical and the second is business. The business angle is important but it's far less important than the philosophical angle.

The philosophical angle is fairly straightforward. Making life multiplanetary will extend the light of human consciousness. Humans are like Earth is like a ping-pong ball in an Olympic size swimming pool and life is a thin, almost impossible to see layer on the outside of that ping-pong ball. Earth looks big because we ourselves are small, but what we don't understand is that human life is fragile. There are tons of things, some in our control and some out of our control, that threaten the long-term survivability of humans on Earth.

I'm an optimist. I really hope that the technologies we make that threaten human life don't get used or even get made. But to deny that there's any risk there is like putting your head in the sand. Your ping-pong ball of life is like a nanometer thick coating on the outside of this ping-pong ball, and you have a bomb that can blow up the ping-pong ball. The answer is yes, you should have multiple ping-pong balls.

Today, if you try to project what the expected lifespan of humans is, I'd generously describe it as tens of thousands of years. We have nuclear weapons and other technologies we hope nobody uses. What's the expected time span before somebody makes a mistake? I'd love to be an optimist and say 50,000 years. But we've only had these technologies for three generations. I'm saying I think we can survive the creation of nuclear weapons for a hundred times more time than they've existed.

But if you make life multiplanetary, particularly if you start with Mars and then expand to other moons in the solar system, you can easily project that the expected lifespan of humanity is in the millions of years. Once you're in the millions of years now you can project all sorts of new technologies that enable humans to do things like light speed travel, maybe Dyson spheres.

If your objective is to have a good time on Earth then yeah absolutely, Mars is not for you. But if your objective is to make humans the greatest species that have ever been, Mars is a great first step to one increase our longevity and two increase our skill and ability to proliferate across the galaxy. The philosophical angle is really that going to Mars is a first step in extending the light of human consciousness. We're a very small light in a very big place, and to make that light brighter, Mars is definitely our first step.

The business angle is like a side quest. Mars offers something that can't be sold on Earth, which is the greatest adventure that humans have ever done, period. There is no like the origin of the term venture capital is capital that was given to people to go on ventures or ad-ventures, right? Venture capital was initially created so that a courageous sailor could go buy a boat and try to sail to an island and hopefully find something or ore and bring it back. Mars is a place that allows us to sell the greatest adventure of all time to people who want to go. Our job is just to make it so that the price of going to Mars is lower than the price that people want to pay for this incredible adventure.

**Ti:** So you're thinking about it from the perspective of okay, SpaceX is going to solve the transportation to and from, and here's some other angle where you can radically help that mission but it's not directly the transport part?

**Saurav:** Yeah, absolutely. We're definitely not in the business of making rockets and we don't find ourselves to be competitive with companies that make rockets whatsoever. All we're saying is that if you want Mars to be an explosive, proliferative business—which is a prerequisite for it being a proliferative thing that humans do at all—we're not going to do a trillion dollar charity project to go to Mars. It won't happen. And honestly, I don't think the money would be spent well either if it was a massive charity project.

**Ti:** Starting Starpath, what was the moment when you realized okay, we need to build this company?

**Saurav:** Yeah, it was one of those things where we were doing other things and we had a realization that the bottleneck to making Mars viable was not rockets. SpaceX was solving that. The bottleneck was propellant production on Mars. So we realized that this was an important problem that needed to be solved, and we decided to start a company to solve it. We brought together a team of really talented engineers and we got to work. That was about two and a half years ago.

**Ti:** The moon, why do you think Mars is more viable than the moon?

**Saurav:** Yeah, it's a great question. The moon doesn't have access to the same organic compounds that Mars does. If you wanted to make something like bread, you would find that some of the elements that go into making bread aren't present in large quantities on the moon. Even if you take out the fact that there's barely any water on the moon, there's no atmosphere, the nights are fourteen days, the days are fourteen days, and you just look at the fact that theoretically with infinitely capable technology, could I make this a planet that's livable? The answer is no. But with Mars, the answer is absolutely yes. It's just challenging to make that technology, and we're up for the challenge.

**Ti:** And now that you look at like, okay, what entities in the world define where humans are going to go? Obviously a company like Starpath will be one of those major players in a few years, but right now there are basically two major entities: NASA and SpaceX. SpaceX has been very clear publicly about their objectives and is building a rocket that can go to the moon and Mars. But looking at their publicly talked about plans, the overwhelming majority of the rockets that they're building are Mars-bound. Right now SpaceX is building a factory that can make tens of Starships per year.

**Saurav:** Soon it will be hundreds of Starships per year. The fleet of Starships will be a thousand plus. Low Earth orbit and the moon are very close. So there is no reason to have a fleet of a thousand Starships unless you're sending them to Mars. In fact, just two Starships could service the entire low Earth orbit market for satellites and something like five Starships could service effectively infinite volume of cargo to the surface of the moon.

The only reason why SpaceX is building a fleet of a thousand Starships—which they've talked about publicly—is because the roundtrip journey to Mars and back takes about four years. If you want to do a million tons of cargo to the surface of Mars you have to have a big fleet because you can't refly the fleet every day or every two days or every five days like you can with low Earth orbit and the moon. I also find it kind of interesting that it's honestly like, at least short term, way more efficient to just scale the production of Starships on Earth instead of trying to get the Starships back from Mars in the first place because it's just so much easier to put up a production facility here.

**Ti:** Yeah, so in the early days and SpaceX has now talked about this publicly—though I'm not a spokesperson for SpaceX so take this with a grain of salt—they will not be bringing Starships back from Mars. They're one-way trips, primarily because building the infrastructure on Mars is extremely challenging to enable Starships to fly back home. And that's why Starpath exists. So SpaceX will tell you that they're going to fly Starships back from Mars. Our goal is to make that possible at least four years sooner than they're expecting.

**Saurav:** That's the relationship we want to have. We're not competitive with SpaceX. We're complementary. And that's really the story.

**Ti:** How do you keep fast iteration loops as you scale?

**Saurav:** Yeah, it's a great question. I think the key is to not over-engineer things. A lot of times in the space industry, companies over-engineer things by a lot. They build things to be reliable, but they build them so reliable that they become extremely expensive. What we do is we ask ourselves, okay, what's the actual requirement here? And we build things just to meet that requirement and not beyond.

For example, with our rovers, we didn't build them to be 99% reliable. We built them to be eighty or ninety percent reliable because that's actually cheaper than building them to be 99% reliable. If one of your robots fails, you just build another one. That's cheaper than making the first robot so reliable that it never fails.

**Ti:** And what if you need more than a thousand Starships to make Mars viable?

**Saurav:** Yeah, that's an interesting question. I think if you need more than a thousand Starships to make Mars viable, then it's probably not viable. But I don't think that's the case. I think with a thousand Starships you can move enough cargo to Mars to make it self-sustaining. And once it's self-sustaining, you don't need more Starships. You can just keep those thousand Starships in orbit and use them as needed.

**Ti:** What are Starpath's biggest risks?

**Saurav:** Yeah, the biggest risks are execution risks. Can we actually build the technology? Can we actually scale it? Can we actually deliver the products on time and on budget? Those are the big risks. The other big risk is that SpaceX doesn't execute as fast as we think they will. If SpaceX gets Starships back from Mars before we do, then our whole business model falls apart. But I don't think that's going to happen because I think it's a lot harder than people think to build propellant production on Mars.

The third risk is regulatory. The government might decide that we can't build factories on Mars or something like that. But I don't think that's a big risk because there's no government that can enforce regulations on Mars. Once you're on Mars, you're on your own.

**Ti:** So finding talent that's aligned with the mission is incredibly important. How do you attract people who are excited about going to Mars?

**Saurav:** Yeah, it's a great question. I think the key is to be very mission-driven. We tell people, here's what we're trying to do. We're trying to make humans a multiplanetary species. We're trying to extend the light of human consciousness. If you believe in that mission, then come work with us. And people do. We've attracted some really talented engineers who are excited about the mission and are willing to work really hard to make it happen.

The other thing is that we try to make the work culture at Starpath really good. We don't work crazy hours. We don't have unnecessary meetings. We just focus on building great products. And I think that attracts people who are genuinely interested in doing great work.

**Ti:** Living on Mars, what would that be like?

**Saurav:** Living on Mars would be incredible. I think the first few people on Mars would have to be really tough and really committed. They'd have to be willing to live in a small habitat for a long time. But once you have a few thousand people on Mars, it would be like living in Antarctica, but with views of Olympus Mons and Valles Marineris.

I think the biggest challenge would be the dust. Martian dust is extremely fine and gets into everything. But if you had a good habitat, with good seals and good filters, you could make it comfortable.

**Ti:** So you're basically talking about the "idiot index" in the space industry. Can you explain what that is for people listening?

**Saurav:** Yeah, the idiot index is a useful metric. It's the ratio of the cost of a finished good to the cost of the raw inputs. So for an iPhone that costs a thousand dollars, if the raw materials in the iPhone are worth like ten dollars, then the idiot index is one hundred to one.

In aerospace, the idiot index can be like hundreds or sometimes thousands to one. You buy a product for ten thousand dollars where if you had the design for the product, you could fabricate it for fifty dollars. That's an idiot index of two hundred to one. It's a good gut check as to whether the finished good is a good deal. And if you're basing some sort of economic model or constraint against the price of an item, you also want to know the idiot index.

For example, NASA's Mars rovers are not idiotic because they're extremely capable machines. But they're very expensive to build. The idiot index is very high. If you wanted to make a thousand of them, you would not take the price of the NASA Mars rover and multiply it by a thousand. You'd take the price, see how much you can improve it, which might be a thousand times, and then multiply by one thousand. So you could maybe make a rover that costs five hundred thousand that's almost as good as the NASA rover.

**Ti:** And what about nuclear? Why is the idiot index so high in the nuclear industry?

**Saurav:** The idiot index is super high in nuclear mostly because of regulatory. It's not just regulation though. The majority of the regulatory burden in making nuclear reactors comes from people who care about the environment, which is fate loves irony. Nuclear reactors are one of the best technologies for protecting the environment because you have effectively emission-free energy production. It's basically zero emission relative to all other forms. It's better than solar. It's better than wind. And I'm a big fan of like every form of energy production in the world less than probably coal mining.

So nuclear is the ultimate technology. But regulation makes the idiot index super high. And in aerospace, the idiot index is super high because almost all of the goods are sold at extremely low volume. If you've made a thing that costs a hundred bucks to make, but you spent two hundred grand making it and you're only going to sell five, then it's at least forty grand per unit. And if you want to make a profit, it's going to be two hundred grand per unit.

And so the question is, what's our experience like buying solar panels from existing vendors? I don't know what their profit margins are, but all I can say is that because they're only selling to a few satellites every year, there's no incentive to make the price small. When the price is like one thousand dollars per watt, where on Earth we make solar panels for forty-four cents per watt, you can go to Home Depot and buy a panel for under a dollar per watt. The incentive to make the production cheap isn't really there.

So the idiot index is super high. The first order of magnitude improvement you can make on the idiot index for any given good in aerospace is by just trying to make it cheaper. If all you do is ask okay what are the expensive parts, what makes it expensive? Is it labor? Is it a unique material that there's only one supplier of? Is it a finished good from another company that has a high idiot index? And you just remove that, you'll usually get a 10x improvement.

So if all you want is 10x better, all you have to do for most applications is just look at the thing, ask why it's expensive, find the thing that costs the most—which usually accounts for 90% of the cost—and remove it in one way or another. Maybe you remove it by testing a cheaper alternative and it works. Maybe you remove it by vertically integrating the production of that costly good. This is roughly speaking how all of the products that have seen scale in the space industry have reached where they are. They asked what's expensive, deleted that, and added something else that's maybe 20% worse and a thousand times cheaper. In some cases, better and cheaper too.

We do the same thing. Sometimes you want to make more than a 10x improvement—maybe a 100x improvement. In that circumstance you sometimes have to take a completely different approach. Maybe the reason why something is expensive is because you have a requirement that isn't real. Maybe it's the case that you think you need fault tolerance or redundancy but actually if you work out the economic model and say okay 10% of my machines will fail completely—that's actually much cheaper than making it so reliable that only 1% of your machines fail. Those are tech tricks you can use to make your cost basis way lower.

But it's pretty case by case and actually the first thing gets you most of the way there. Like if you just ask okay why is this motor forty thousand dollars? You can shop for motors online for spacecraft that are forty thousand dollars. Easily you can find that. And either just delete the motor entirely and make a new one or something in between. You can get usually from forty thousand to four thousand pretty easily.

## Verification Footnotes

[^1]: **TVAC (Thermal Vacuum)**: A controlled test chamber that simulates the thermal and vacuum conditions of space. The test exposes spacecraft and rovers to extreme temperatures (both hot and cold) and near-perfect vacuum to verify they can operate in actual space conditions. This is a standard qualification test for all space hardware.
