# The Greatest Discovery About Reality & the Consciousness Behind It

**Participants:** André Duqum (Host, Know Thyself Podcast) and Dr. Donald Hoffman (Cognitive Scientist, UC Irvine)  
**Context:** Third conversation exploring consciousness, perception, evolutionary game theory, and Hoffman's groundbreaking work on trace logic—a mathematical framework suggesting consciousness is fundamental and spacetime emerges from observer experiences.

---

**André:** Welcome back to the Know Thyself podcast. Our guest today is back for the third time. We love him so much and I'm excited to dive into this conversation exploring the nature of reality and its many different aspects. He is a cognitive psychologist, an author, a consciousness researcher, and somebody whose extensive research in both consciousness and evolutionary game theory has positioned him uniquely to be a pioneer in emerging discoveries around the nature of reality that really shakes up our intuitions and notions of what it is in the first place. Donald Hoffman.

**Donald:** Thank you, André. Good to be back. It's great to be here again, the third time. Thank you very much for having me back.

**André:** I think it's going to be great to set a bit of the framework and set the stage, not assuming people have tuned into the previous two conversations. Let's start off very baseline. Can you explain to the layman how we don't see reality as it is?

**Donald:** Most of us assume that what you see is what you get. I see a car—that's because there really is a car there. I see the moon—that's because the moon really is there. And so forth. And those who know evolutionary theory, for example, might say, well, the reason we know that we see the truth is because we evolved to be fit. And to be fit, you should see the truth. The more accurate your perceptions are, the better you should see the truth about reality. And those who think that this isn't reality—if you don't think that car is real, if you step in front of it, you'll find out that it is real, that it can hurt you. So those are the kinds of intuitions that we all have.

And it just turns out when you look at evolutionary theory carefully—Darwin didn't have mathematics. He gave a beautiful theory but there wasn't any mathematics. But John Maynard Smith in the 1970s mathematized Darwin's ideas and it's a field called evolutionary game theory. So now we can take Darwin's ideas and look at mathematical theorems about what's entailed by his theory. And you can ask the question: what is the probability that organisms are shaped by evolution to see aspects of reality as it is truthfully?

And the bottom line is the probability is zero. That's the bottom line. When you do the math, the probability is zero.

The reason is slightly technical but not too hard—there's something called fitness functions. They describe for a given organism, if you take this action and you're in this state, what the consequences, the fitness consequences, will be for you. And by fitness, evolutionary theory of course means the chances of successfully reproducing. So that's the measure of fitness we're talking about—the probability of reproducing successfully.

When you look at these fitness payoff functions, since they're what's shaping the sensory systems of the organisms—that's what's shaping evolution in evolutionary game theory—these fitness payoff functions depend on the state of the world, the organism, its actions, and you get a payoff. Just to be very concrete: if I'm a human being and I'm standing in the middle of the 405 freeway at 10:00 in the morning, that's a bad place to be and my fitness payoff is death. That's really a dumb thing to do. So you can see—you take an organism, put it in a place, put it in an action, and then you get a number, thumbs up or thumbs down for your fitness payoffs.

So these are functions, and for those who know some mathematics, they are just functions. And it turns out there's no constraint on these functions in evolutionary theory. There's no constraint that says they only have to be continuous or they have to be quadratic—there's just no constraint from the theory. Darwin's theory doesn't tell us these are the kinds of functions. So given that, we ask: what is the probability? We can just look at the space of all possible fitness payoff functions and ask how many of them will shape perceptions to give truth?

And if you want truth—the structure of true reality has a certain structure, the structure that you're trying to see—that structure is going to in general be infinitely complicated. The reason is because it's infinitely complicated—if we have wave functions that we're talking about in quantum field theory, these wave functions map from an infinite dimensional space to complex numbers. That's infinitely complex. That's the underlying structure of reality according to our best physical theories. So if that structure that's out there of objective reality is infinitely complex, the chances that the fitness payoff functions that evolution shapes us with will track that infinite complexity is zero.

If I just say, here's an infinitely complex function and here's another infinitely complex function, the chance that they agree is zero. That's just a measure-theoretic fact. You can just look at it. The space of infinitely complex functions—the probability that any two agree is zero.

So the bottom line from evolutionary game theory is: reality is not the way that we perceive it. You don't see the truth. Evolution by natural selection doesn't shape you to see the truth. It shapes you for what I call "fitness payoffs," which are all about your offspring, not about seeing truth. And fitness payoffs are almost certainly going to be radically different from truth.

**André:** So reality is infinitely more complex than what we're perceiving through our sensory systems.

**Donald:** That's exactly right. And what I'm saying is that when you actually do the mathematics of Darwinian evolution—evolutionary game theory—it says that the probability that your perceptions are going to be veridical, are going to be true, is zero. And the reason is simple: evolution doesn't care about truth, it cares about fitness. And fitness is almost surely not the same as truth.

Now, there's a very important point here. I'm not saying that our perceptions are random or unrelated to reality. Quite the contrary. Our perceptions are deeply related to reality—they're a systematic guide to fitness. But a guide to fitness is not the same thing as a guide to truth. Just like the icons on your desktop are a systematic guide to what you can do with the files on your computer, but they're not the files themselves. They're not showing you the structure of the files—the diodes, voltages, magnetic fields. They're showing you something useful for your purposes, which is moving files around, deleting them, and so forth.

**André:** So you're drawing a parallel between our perception of reality and a desktop interface.

**Donald:** That's exactly right. The desktop interface is a very nice example of a user interface that's not trying to show you the truth about the computer. It's trying to show you something useful. And when you drag a blue icon to the trash, the computer doesn't think there's a little blue rectangular region of space that got dragged to a trash can. The computer doesn't speak that language at all. The language of space and the language of colors and shapes—that's not the language the computer speaks. The computer speaks the language of voltages and magnetic fields and so forth.

But for you as a user, you don't want to see that level of complexity. You want to have a simple interface that lets you do what you need to do. And evolution has done the same thing for us. Evolution has given us perceptual systems—our senses of vision, hearing, taste, touch, and so on—that are user interfaces. They're not showing us reality as it is. They're showing us a simplified, species-specific user interface that guides adaptive behavior.

**André:** That's fascinating. So when I see a table, that table isn't really there in the way I'm perceiving it?

**Donald:** That's exactly right. When you see a table, you're having an experience. That experience is real—the conscious experience is real. But what that experience is telling you is not that there's really a physical table made of atoms and molecules out there in space. What it's telling you is: there's something that you could interact with in a certain way that would be useful for you. Maybe you could put your cup on it, maybe you could lean on it. But the actual structure of objective reality that's causing you to have that experience is almost surely radically different from a table made of atoms in space.

And this is where quantum mechanics actually comes to the rescue. Quantum mechanics is telling us that the classical notions of objects in space and time—objects with definite positions and definite velocities—that's not fundamental. At the quantum level, we have wave functions, we have superpositions, we have entanglement. And all of that is telling us that the classical world of objects in space and time is not the fundamental reality.

**André:** So quantum mechanics is actually supporting this idea that our classical perception isn't showing us the fundamental nature of reality.

**Donald:** Absolutely. And what's even more radical is that physicists today—many of them, including Nobel Prize winners—are telling us that space and time themselves are not fundamental. Space and time are doomed, to use the phrase that Nima Arkani-Hamed uses. He's a physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He and many other physicists are saying that we need a theory that goes beyond space and time.

Why are they saying that? Because when you try to bring quantum theory and general relativity together—Einstein's theory of gravity—they don't play well together. When you try to put them together, you get infinities, you get nonsense. And the reason is that both theories assume that space and time are fundamental. But when you try to bring them together at the smallest scales—what's called the Planck scale, which is about 10^-33 centimeters—space and time themselves fall apart. The notion of space and time becomes meaningless.

So physicists are saying we need a deeper theory that doesn't start with space and time. We need to start with something deeper and show how space and time emerge from that deeper reality. And what I'm proposing is that the deeper reality is consciousness. Conscious experiences and conscious agents are the fundamental reality, and space and time are a species-specific user interface that we create on the fly.

**André:** That's a significant claim. How do you get from conscious experiences to space and time?

**Donald:** That's the key question. And until recently, I didn't have a good answer to that. I've been working on this problem for almost 40 years. I wrote a book with two mathematicians in 1989 called "Observer Mechanics" where we were trying to develop a mathematical framework for understanding how observers and their experiences could be fundamental. But we didn't have the right mathematical tools.

And then about a year and a half ago, I discovered something I call "trace logic." And just six months ago, I realized what I had. I think I found the key that I've been looking for for 40 years. This is actually the first time I've talked about this in depth publicly.

Here's the basic idea. Let's take the simplest, most drop-dead stupid model of consciousness we can come up with. You have experiences—like seeing red, tasting mint, hearing a sound. And those experiences change probabilistically. That's it. That's the model. It's called a Markov chain in mathematics. You have states—the different experiences you can have—and you have probabilities that you'll transition from one experience to another.

Now, that doesn't sound very promising, right? You're going to get all of space-time physics out of that? Small chance. That's what I thought until I discovered the trace logic.

**André:** What is the trace logic?

**Donald:** The trace logic is a way of understanding how different observers' experiences relate to each other. It's all about observers and their experiences. Here's the key insight: imagine I'm an observer with my Markov chain of experiences, and you're an observer with your Markov chain of experiences. The question is: how do our experiences relate? How does your clock relate to my clock? How do distances between your experiences relate to distances between my experiences?

The trace logic answers these questions. And here's what's remarkable: when you work out the mathematics of the trace logic, you discover that certain very special Markov chains—what I call "n-cycles"—have a beautiful property. When you look at how time and distance transform between different observers looking at these n-cycles, you get exactly the time dilation and length contraction formulas from Einstein's special relativity.

**André:** Wait—you're saying that Einstein's relativity equations come out of this simple model of conscious experiences?

**Donald:** That's exactly what I'm saying. The mathematics of the trace logic gives us exactly the Lorentz transformations—the equations that tell us how time slows down and lengths contract when you're moving at high speeds. These are the foundational equations of Einstein's special relativity. And they come directly from asking: how do different observers' experiences of these n-cycle Markov chains relate to each other?

And it's not just time dilation and length contraction. We also get the result that nothing can travel faster than a certain maximum speed—which would be the speed of light. We get that no inertial frame is special. We get all of the structure of what's called Minkowski spacetime, which is Einstein's special relativity.

**André:** That's remarkable. But that's just special relativity. What about general relativity and curved spacetime?

**Donald:** That's the next step. What I'm proposing—and this is still being worked out mathematically—is that n-cycles give us flat Minkowski spacetime. But there's a larger class of Markov chains that will give us curved spacetime. The curvature of spacetime, which in general relativity is related to gravity, comes from having Markov chains that aren't perfect n-cycles. They have different properties that lead to different relationships between time and distance for different observers.

So the idea is that spacetime—both flat and curved—emerges from the trace logic relationships between different conscious observers and their experiences. And spacetime is going to turn out to be a very tiny, special case. Most Markov chains won't project into any spacetime at all. They'll be too complicated. They might have properties like expander graphs or other weird mathematical properties that preclude them from projecting into spacetime.

So spacetime isn't the final reality. It's a trivial—essentially zero percent—of the new reality that's unfolding when we step outside of spacetime and say: let's take our simplest, most drop-dead stupid model of consciousness and see what we can do with that.

**André:** So you're saying most possible conscious experiences don't correspond to anything we would recognize as space and time?

**Donald:** That's exactly right. Spacetime is a very special, very limited case. And that makes sense, because physicists are telling us that spacetime breaks down at the Planck scale. Spacetime is not fundamental. It's an approximation, a useful fiction, a user interface. But it's not the deep reality.

**André:** Let's talk about language and how it shapes our perception of reality. How does language play into all of this?

**Donald:** Language is itself a user interface. The words we use—like "table," "chair," "red," "blue"—these are all part of the user interface that we've constructed. They're not describing the fundamental nature of reality. They're describing experiences and how we can interact with the world in ways that are useful for our fitness.

And what's interesting is that we learn these words by what's called ostensive definition. My mother points to something and says "red," and I learn to associate that word with a certain experience I'm having. But I don't know if your experience when you see red is the same as my experience. We use the same word because we learned it in the same contexts from our mothers. Our mothers used the same words in the same contexts. But that doesn't mean the underlying experiences are the same.

This is the old philosophical problem of qualia—the subjective, qualitative aspects of experience. I can't know if your experience of red is the same as mine. We can't compare them directly. All we can do is use language to coordinate our behaviors. And language does that job beautifully. But it doesn't give us access to the true nature of reality or even to each other's true experiences.

**André:** What about altered states of consciousness? How do they fit into this framework?

**Donald:** Altered states of consciousness are fascinating because they reveal that our normal waking state—what we think of as "normal" reality—is just one particular configuration of the user interface. When you have an altered state—whether through meditation, psychedelics, near-death experiences, or other means—you're essentially changing the configuration of your user interface. You're seeing a different projection of the deeper reality.

And what people often report in altered states is very consistent with what I'm saying. They report that space and time feel different or disappear altogether. They report a sense of unity—that everything is connected, that there are no separate objects. They report that consciousness feels more fundamental than the physical world. These reports are exactly what you would expect if space, time, and separate objects are just features of a user interface, and in an altered state, that interface is reconfigured or stripped away.

The mystical traditions have been saying this for thousands of years. They've been saying that the world of separate objects in space and time is maya, is illusion, is not the fundamental reality. And they've been saying that through practices like meditation, you can see through the illusion to the deeper reality, which is consciousness itself.

**André:** So the spiritual traditions have been pointing to this all along?

**Donald:** That's exactly right. The interesting thing is that spiritual traditions have been saying this for thousands of years. And now the best science—evolutionary game theory, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, studies in spacetime physics—is saying the same thing. The best science does not say you're just a lump of atoms that happens to have some consciousness. The best science is now saying we need to take consciousness as fundamental.

And here's what's really interesting: if consciousness is fundamental and we're all different perspectives on that one fundamental consciousness, then when you love your neighbor, you literally are loving yourself. From this bigger point of view, we're not separate. The separateness is just part of the user interface. The deep reality is that we're all one consciousness experiencing itself from different perspectives.

**André:** Let's talk about the observer in physics. You mentioned this is a major unsolved problem.

**Donald:** This is one of the deepest problems in science. In Newton's physics, the observer was basically ignored. Newton assumed that the observer just sees reality as it is and doesn't affect what's being observed. So Newton didn't really need a theory of the observer—you just see the truth.

With Einstein, there's a notion of an observer, but it's mostly just different clocks and coordinate systems. Different observers might measure different times and distances, but there's no really deep theory of the observer beyond the clocks.

In quantum theory, now you're forced to consider what you mean by an observer because quantum theory says that when you don't observe a system, it evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. That's a unitary evolution—very smooth, very deterministic. But when you observe a system, then empirical experiments tell us that what happens is not a unitary evolution. You get a single answer. Maybe an electron or photon was in a superposition of all these different paths it could be taking under the Schrödinger equation, but when you make a measurement, you get a dot on the screen. You get a single answer. And that's not a unitary process.

So that raises a deep question about what we mean by an observer, and quantum mechanics really can't avoid it. The problem is that if you want to say an observer is just any physical measuring device—and many quantum theorists have said that—well, no Schrödinger evolution, no physical device described by Schrödinger evolution, can do that. A device that gives you a single output from a superposition does not satisfy the Schrödinger equation.

So we have a problem. If the universe behaves one way under the Schrödinger equation when you don't observe, you can't just call in a measuring device and say it does it. What is your theory of the measuring device? Is it a quantum theory? Then give me your unitary operator. A unitary operator can't give you a single output.

Some will say you can do it with what they call decoherence. The bottom line is decoherence doesn't solve the problem. Decoherence gets rid of the complex numbers, the complex amplitudes, and it can give you a real set of probabilities—a set of outcomes with real probabilities. But it doesn't give you a single outcome. So decoherence gives you what we call a mixed state with probabilities, real probabilities of outcomes. But that's not what happens in an experiment. We get a single answer.

Frank Wilczek, a Nobel Prize winner for his work in quantum chromodynamics, points this out. Quantum mechanics needs a theory of the observer. That's an open, nasty problem. Right now, science does not have anything close to a universally agreed-on theory of the observer. It's considered one of the big open problems by Nobel Prize winners in quantum physics.

**André:** So the question of what an observer is remains unanswered in physics?

**Donald:** Science doesn't have an answer. It does not have an answer.

**André:** How do you explain why the physicalist notion and paradigm of consciousness cannot explain a single qualia or experience?

**Donald:** Most of my colleagues in cognitive neuroscience who are studying consciousness are physicalists. They're brilliant—good friends and colleagues—and they're assuming that space and time are fundamental and that certain physical systems in spacetime that have certain properties will give rise to conscious experiences.

The assumption is that presumably at the Big Bang there were no conscious experiences. Space and time and physical objects just didn't have the right kind of causal or functional properties to generate or instantiate consciousness. But after billions of years of evolution, you start getting the right kinds of causal structures or functional structures.

For example, there's integrated information theory—certain causal structures are identical to certain conscious experiences. Or global workspace theory—certain functional properties. There's orchestrated collapse of quantum states of microtubules in the Penrose-Hameroff theory. There are many theories, and I'm just mentioning a few.

But the theme behind all of them is: there is a physical substrate in space and time that's necessary. And if that substrate has the right properties—the right causal and functional properties—it will give rise to consciousness.

**André:** But you're saying the experience itself—like the smell of a flower or the taste of chocolate—has yet to be explained through this physicalist approach?

**Donald:** That's exactly right. Some physicalists will say that physical systems with the right properties will give rise to conscious experiences. Others, like Dan Dennett, would say they give rise to the illusion of conscious experiences.

As a hard-nosed scientist, I want explanations of specific conscious experiences. No one has put a gun to my friends' and colleagues' heads to say you must come up with a physicalist framework and explain the taste of mint in that framework. They've chosen to do that, and they're making claims that there are causal structures that are identical to the taste of mint.

For example, integrated information theory says there's a matrix—you can actually write down a Markov matrix. It's a square array of numbers. It could be 10 rows and 10 columns, so it has 100 numbers in it, and each row is a probability measure. That's going to give you your causal structure. No nonsense—there's this mathematical model there. And that is, if it's the right causal structure, it will be the taste of mint or the smell of garlic or whatever it might be.

I didn't tell them to do that. I didn't say they had to do that. No one told them that. They've chosen to do that. So as a scientist, I say, "Okay, well, you're proposing that theory. Great. Give me one."

There are literally trillions of experiences that humans can have. Trillions. Should be like shooting fish in a barrel. Pick one. Pick any experience that you want and give me your matrix. Tell me, is it 1,000 by 1,000? Is it 1,253 by 1,253? What's the principled reason for why it has to have that number of rows and columns? And then if it's 1,000 by 1,000, well, there are a million numbers. 1,000 times 1,000 is a million. So there are a million numbers. And as a scientist, you need to tell me why each one of those million numbers is exactly the value it is and why that's necessary for this to be the causal structure of mint.

Again, I didn't tell you to do this. No one put a gun to your head. You're offering this theory, and I'm just being a hard-nosed scientist and saying, "Okay, that's your theory. Give me one. Give me a particular case."

I do this at conferences all the time. My buddies are up there and they know I'm going to do it. And the answer in every case is they can't give one. There are trillions of experiences and zero have been explained. Zero. And it's not because these people are dumb. They're brilliant. Some of them are geniuses.

You can't construct conscious experiences from unconscious ingredients. Can't be done. Just that simple. And 99% of the research in the cognitive neuroscience of consciousness is of this type.

**André:** So why do they continue with this approach if it hasn't produced results?

**Donald:** Here's why they do it. There are incredible neural correlates of conscious experiences. Anybody who studied in this area knows hundreds of well-known neural correlates. When you have certain patterns of brain activity, you have certain experiences. Change the brain activity, change the experience. There are tight correlations.

But correlation is not causation. And this is where my colleagues make a mistake. They see these tight correlations and they say, "Aha! The brain activity causes the consciousness." But that's not justified by the correlation. The correlation is entirely consistent with consciousness being fundamental and the brain activity being a representation—an icon in the user interface—that tracks what's going on at the deeper level of consciousness.

Think of it this way. When you move an icon on your desktop, there are voltages and magnetic fields changing in the computer. There's a perfect correlation between the movement of the icon and the changes in the computer. But the icon doesn't cause the changes in the computer. The icon is a representation, a useful simplification, of what's going on in the computer.

Similarly, brain activity is an icon that represents what's going on at the deeper level of consciousness. The brain activity doesn't cause consciousness. Rather, consciousness is fundamental, and the brain is how that consciousness appears when you look at it through the user interface of space and time.

**André:** So the neural correlates don't prove that the brain creates consciousness?

**Donald:** That's exactly right. The neural correlates are consistent with consciousness being fundamental. In fact, I would argue they're more naturally explained by consciousness being fundamental. Because if you start with unconscious ingredients and try to build consciousness, you face what's called the hard problem of consciousness—how do you get subjective experience from objective physical processes? No one has solved that problem in hundreds of years of trying.

But if you start with consciousness as fundamental, there's no hard problem. Consciousness is just what exists. The hard problem becomes: how does consciousness create the appearance of a physical world? And that's what the trace logic does. It shows how conscious experiences, following simple probabilistic rules, give rise to the structure of spacetime.

**André:** Let's talk about the relationship between your theory and quantum mechanics. How does quantum theory emerge from conscious experiences?

**Donald:** This is something my collaborator Chetan Prakash discovered about 10 years ago. I've been talking about the step-by-step Markov chain—if the light is red now, then maybe it'll turn green next, then yellow, and so forth. That's step-by-step. That's like looking at a movie one frame at a time.

But when you step back and try to look at the whole movie in real time, you get a different picture. When we look at a Markov chain not step-by-step but at the big picture of what's happening in the dynamics of the Markov chain, we call that the long-term behavior. The way you do that is you compute what are called the harmonic functions of these Markov chains. These harmonic functions tell you the long-term behavior.

And what Chetan discovered is these harmonic functions are exactly the same mathematical functions as quantum wave functions for free particles. The quantum wave functions for free particles and the harmonic functions of the Markov chains we're looking at are the same thing.

**André:** So quantum wave functions are describing the long-term behavior of conscious experiences?

**Donald:** That's exactly right. We're proposing that spacetime is constructed by the n-cycles of Markov chains in the way I just described, and quantum wave functions are describing not the detailed dynamics of conscious experiences—they're giving just the top-level picture of it, not the step-by-step.

In other words, in this consciousness framework, I'm telling you every step of the way what's going on. In the spacetime headset, quantum mechanics just says you don't need to look at all those details. Here's just what's happening long-term. You only get to see the big long-term picture.

I'm showing you what are called the hidden variables. This is what's called a hidden variables theory of quantum mechanics. These hidden variables are things that you don't see inside—they're hidden to quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics doesn't describe them, but they're right there in the harmonic functions of the Markov chains.

And what's interesting about the harmonic functions—everything is real in my Markov chain. All the probabilities are real. But when you take these harmonic functions, you get complex numbers as part of taking the harmonic function. So where does all the weirdness of complex amplitudes come from? It's because you're not looking at the full reality. You're getting the top-level gloss—harmonic functions—and those use complex numbers to describe the long-term behavior of it.

So we get spacetime and quantum theory coming out of conscious experiences.

**André:** What about Bell's theorem? Doesn't that prove there are no hidden variable theories?

**Donald:** John Bell's theorem is true, and it doesn't apply to us. What John Bell proved was that there were no hidden variable theories that were measurement-independent, local, and deterministic.

But our theory is not measurement-independent—in fact, it's all about observers. If anything's measurement-dependent, it's observers. So we have a measurement-dependent system. It's probabilistic—it's not deterministic. And it's not local—we're not confined to space and time. We're outside of space and time, and spacetime emerges from the interactions of conscious experiences.

So Bell's theorem is true and it doesn't rule out our hidden variables theory at all because we're non-local, we're not deterministic, and we're measurement-dependent.

**André:** What about the Born rule in quantum mechanics?

**Donald:** The Born rule says if you have a quantum complex amplitude—the wave function—you have to take the amplitude squared to find out the probability of various outcomes occurring. That's the very famous Born rule.

I've done some work on it and I think it's going to come out of the trace logic. I see no obstruction at all. I see no obstruction to getting curved spacetime, I see no obstruction to getting the Born rule. But until you prove it, you can't be certain.

We know the theorems that need to be proven. For example, we need to prove that the Lorentz-Gromov-Hausdorff convergence works from n-cycles to Minkowski space. We need to prove that similar convergence will work for curved spacetime for a slightly larger class of matrices.

These are very technical mathematical issues. Until we have it, I won't promise more than I can say right now. What we do have is the trace logic is real. That's not going away. The time dilation and space contraction for the n-cycles—that's not going away. That'll be there.

The claim that that will give rise specifically to Minkowski space—we know the theorem that needs to be proven and we haven't proven it yet. I don't see any obstructions, but I'm just a cognitive scientist, so this is real math. We may need some really hard-nosed technical mathematical physicists to bring this stuff home.

It's just been in the last few weeks that I've even known that these are the theorems we need to prove. This is brand new. This is the first time I've actually talked about this.

**André:** It's exciting. Let me try to explain this back to you to see if I understand it. Quantum mechanics says that particles are described by wave functions—probability waves that evolve smoothly but collapse when measured. Your point is that if you look at the long-term dynamics of these Markov chains instead of the step-by-step transitions, the math looks identical to quantum wave functions. So quantum theory is what you see when you zoom out on the probabilistic flow of conscious experiences. Quantum states aren't fundamental—they're the shadow of deeper dynamics of consciousness.

**Donald:** That's exactly right. And this is something the physicist John Wheeler was pointing to. He had a paper in 1989 called "Information, Physics, Quantum: The Search for Links"—the "it from bit" paper. He was basically saying somehow it's all got to be, from his point of view, observer-participatory interactions. That has to be the fundamental thing.

And somehow, he said, that has to give rise to the structure of spacetime and quantum theory. He didn't know how, but he felt like we can't start inside spacetime. We have to start with the observer-participatory thing.

The reason he's taken seriously is he was like the advisor for Richard Feynman, and he himself was an incredible physicist in his own right. In his "it from bit" paper, Wheeler cited my work. I've been working on this stuff for a long time—almost 40 years. It's not like I decided to work on consciousness outside of spacetime recently. I've been working on it since 1985.

In 1989, I published a book with two mathematicians called "Observer Mechanics." You can see I've been—this is not like a new gig for me. Wheeler cited my book in his "it from bit" paper as an example of the kind of thing we might want to try to do in this observer-participatory kind of thing.

I read Wheeler's paper, of course, and I agreed with him. We tried to get into observer mechanics, but we didn't have the trace logic. I didn't have the trace logic until a year and a half ago, and I didn't know what I had until six months ago. I've been after this for 40 years. And just six months ago, I think I found the key that I've been looking for.

Frank Wilczek was saying we need to have some notion of the observer as a foundational concept. What I'm saying is that Wheeler was right. It's all these acts of observer-participatory interactions that somehow build spacetime. And the thing that coordinates them is the trace logic.

The trace logic is just the coordination of how your experiences and my experiences—how your clock is related to my clock, and how the distances between your experiences are related to the distances in my experiences. The trace logic does all of that, and when we compress it down, we get spacetime.

Physics from this point of view—spacetime physics—is nothing but a beautiful way of coordinating all the experiences of the observers.

**André:** So this changes everything about how we think about ourselves and the universe?

**Donald:** It changes the whole thing around. We thought of ourselves in science for the last four centuries as little tiny physical objects in an immense physical universe whose consciousness emerged from unconscious ingredients. And this is turning the whole picture around.

Spacetime is not fundamental. We know it falls apart at the Planck scale. It can't be fundamental. That picture can't be right. But Wheeler's picture is a deeper picture. Observer-participatory interactions outside of spacetime get somehow fashioned into the structure that we call spacetime. But it's consciousness that's first. It's fundamental and it gives rise to what we call spacetime. And it's the trace logic.

And by the way, the trace logic is not hard. I could have thought about it 40 years ago. I just didn't think about it. It's not that hard. I don't know why it took me 40 years. I'm not that bright.

**André:** Do you remember the moment it came to you?

**Donald:** I was at home. One problem we've been working on is how do observers—what we call conscious agents—combine? I have Chetan Prakash and Robert Prentner, two really brilliant friends of mine, longtime collaborators. They had been debating back and forth about a new way of combination.

I looked at what they were saying and it felt wrong. But when I felt that it was wrong, I also felt: here's why it's wrong. And all of a sudden, I saw the trace logic. It was in reaction to trying to figure out how to combine observers and seeing their ideas, seeing that I disagreed with those ideas, and asking myself why do I disagree with those ideas. That's when I saw the trace logic structure. All of a sudden, I just saw it.

Because in the trace logic, it turns out it gives you a way to join two consciousnesses into a single new conscious observer. So it was that problem: how do I take two separate consciousnesses that maybe overlap, maybe we have some similar conscious experiences, but how do we join them together into a coherent new observer? The trace logic does that. It tells you exactly what that join means.

This is actually, in terms of the theory of consciousness, also a breakthrough. It's a breakthrough that says if you have two consciousnesses that do overlap, what is the unique bigger consciousness that could be made out of them that traces down properly to each of the two separate consciousnesses?

**André:** You mentioned split-brain patients. How does that relate?

**Donald:** This is very much like split-brain patients. You have two hemispheres in your brain, left and right. There were experiments done with split-brain patients—people who had problems with epilepsy that couldn't be cured or controlled with drugs.

There were surgeries done where you would take off the top of the skull, take a knife—the guy who did this was Joe Bogen, one of the surgeons. I actually was friends with him. We would meet periodically at UC Irvine and talk consciousness and so forth.

Joe Bogen would take a scalpel and cut the corpus callosum, which is—you have two hemispheres, and there's an Ethernet cable between them connecting them. He cut that cable, part of it or all of it depending on the patient. And what they found was the hemispheres now had their biggest connection severed. There are some smaller connections, but the biggest connection was severed.

Michael Gazzaniga and others then did experiments on these patients and found—they wanted to know what does this connection do and what happens when you separate the hemispheres. Early experiments couldn't find anything different about these people. So some people thought, well, the only thing the corpus callosum does is transmit epileptic seizures from one hemisphere to the other. That's all it's good for.

Well, no, of course that's not the case. What Gazzaniga found was he could isolate information to the hemispheres. It turns out that the right hemisphere only sees the left visual field. The left hemisphere sees only the right visual field. And the left hemisphere gets input from the right side of the body, the right hemisphere gets input from the left side of the body.

So if you give information to just the left visual field quickly before you can do an eye movement, you can send something just to the left visual field and only the right hemisphere sees it. And the left hemisphere controls speech in most people. So if you ask the person, "What did you see?" they'll say, "I didn't see anything," because the left hemisphere that's speaking didn't see it. Only the right hemisphere saw it.

But you can ask the right hemisphere to answer non-verbally—maybe by pointing with the left hand or drawing with the left hand. And the right hemisphere will correctly indicate what it saw, even while the left hemisphere is saying, "I didn't see anything."

So now we have one body with two consciousnesses. The left hemisphere has its own consciousness, its own experiences. The right hemisphere has its own consciousness, its own experiences. Before the surgery, when the corpus callosum was intact, there was one unified consciousness that included both hemispheres.

This is exactly what the trace logic describes. The trace logic tells us: given two separate consciousnesses—the left hemisphere consciousness and the right hemisphere consciousness—what is the unique bigger consciousness that joins them together? And that's what the intact brain with the corpus callosum gives you.

**André:** So consciousness can combine and separate?

**Donald:** That's exactly right. And this is a deep insight. Consciousness is not a thing that's indivisible. Consciousnesses can combine. You and I, right now, we have separate consciousnesses. But from a deeper point of view, you and I are both perspectives of one infinite consciousness.

And that infinite consciousness can experience itself from your perspective, from my perspective, from countless other perspectives. And those perspectives can be isolated from each other, or they can be joined together into larger consciousnesses.

The trace logic gives us the mathematics of how that works. It tells us: given any collection of conscious observers, what is the unique bigger observer that encompasses all of them? And it also tells us: given a big observer, how can you trace down to the smaller observers that are perspectives within that bigger observer?

**André:** This sounds similar to what mystical traditions have been saying.

**Donald:** That's exactly right. The mystical traditions have been saying for thousands of years that we're all one. That the appearance of separateness is an illusion. That at the deepest level, we're all expressions of one infinite consciousness—whether you call it Brahman, the Tao, God, the Source, or whatever.

And what I'm saying is the mathematics of the trace logic is giving us a rigorous way to understand that. We can actually mathematically describe how one infinite consciousness can experience itself from countless different perspectives, and how those perspectives relate to each other.

From this bigger point of view, there's infinite exploration, and the exploration is you. You are consciousness exploring itself. And when you hurt someone else, you're hurting yourself. When you love someone else, you're loving yourself. The smart money is on: yeah, you and I are one.

**André:** Let's talk about the implications of this for how we live our lives. If we're all one consciousness, what does that mean for ethics, for how we should treat each other?

**Donald:** It changes everything. If you really understand that when you're looking at another person, you're looking at yourself from a different perspective, it transforms your relationship to everyone and everything.

The deep spiritual teachings—from Jesus to Buddha to the Upanishads—have always said: love your neighbor as yourself. And we usually interpret that as: you should love your neighbor in the same way you love yourself, as much as you love yourself. But there's a deeper interpretation: love your neighbor because your neighbor IS yourself.

You're not just similar to your neighbor. You're not just connected to your neighbor. You literally ARE your neighbor, seen from a different perspective. And your neighbor is you. We're all the same one consciousness experiencing itself from different vantage points.

**André:** What about death? How does this framework change our understanding of death?

**Donald:** Death is taking off the headset. The body, the brain—these are part of the user interface. They're part of the experience you're having in this particular game, this particular exploration of consciousness.

When the body dies, when the brain shuts down, you're not shutting down consciousness. You're just taking off one particular headset. You're ending one particular perspective. But you, as consciousness, are infinite and eternal. You don't die. You can't die. You're the fundamental reality.

Now, the particular perspective that you have in this life—the particular collection of memories, habits, personality traits—that configuration may dissolve. Just like when you take off a VR headset, the particular game you were playing comes to an end. But you, the player, don't cease to exist.

And from the deeper point of view, you as this infinite consciousness are simultaneously experiencing countless other perspectives. Death of one perspective is like closing one window on your computer while countless other windows remain open. And you can always open new windows.

**André:** This is profound. But it's also challenging because it goes against our intuitions about being separate individuals.

**Donald:** That's exactly right. And that's why the spiritual path is described as challenging, as requiring practice and discipline. Because our intuitions, our habits, our whole way of being in the world is based on the assumption that we're separate individuals.

The user interface—the experience of being a body in space, separate from other bodies—is so compelling, so immediate, so constant, that we forget it's just an interface. We think it's reality. We think we really are these separate bodies.

And evolution has shaped us to have that intuition because it was useful for our survival and reproduction. Organisms that acted as if they were separate bodies, that protected their bodies, that competed with other bodies for resources—those organisms left more offspring. So we're wired to feel separate.

But the spiritual traditions tell us: you have to see through the illusion. You have to recognize that the separateness is just part of the headset. And seeing through it—waking up, enlightenment, whatever you want to call it—is a process. It's not something that happens all at once for most people. It's a gradual recognition, a gradual shift in how you experience reality.

**André:** You mentioned earlier that you wanted to talk about something you've discovered recently—something about the mathematics of perception and time dilation?

**Donald:** Yes. This is where things get really interesting with the trace logic. What I've discovered is that when you have these n-cycle Markov chains and you look at how different observers relate to each other, you find that time and distance don't just transform according to Einstein's equations—they actually come from taking square roots.

Here's what I mean. In the Markov chain, everything is positive. Probabilities are positive, transitions are positive. But when we trace down to spacetime, we get signed distances and signed times. We get positive and negative. Where does that come from?

It comes from taking square roots. When you take the square root of a positive number, you get two answers—a positive and a negative. So when I take the square root to get distances and times in spacetime, I get plus and minus distances, plus and minus times.

And I believe that gives us what's called CPT symmetry in physics—charge conjugation, parity inversion, and time reversal symmetry—which has been shown empirically. So if this is right, then not only do I explain why the speed of light is the same in all inertial frames, why no massive object can ever travel at the speed of light, why no inertial frame is special, but also where CPT symmetry comes from.

It comes from the fact that the conscious agent dynamics is not inside spacetime, and we need to take square roots to get the space lengths and clock times that we see inside spacetime. It's that fact that gives us the CPT symmetry.

**André:** So the mathematical structure of spacetime—including these deep symmetries—comes from how consciousness projects down into the headset of space and time?

**Donald:** That's exactly right. And this suggests that other properties of spacetime that physicists have discovered—things like gauge symmetries, conservation laws, the structure of the Standard Model—all of these might have explanations in terms of how consciousness projects into spacetime.

We're at the very beginning of this research. The trace logic is brand new. The connection to spacetime physics is just being worked out. But I think we're on the verge of a revolution in our understanding of reality. We're moving from a view where consciousness is an accidental byproduct of a material universe to a view where consciousness is fundamental and the material universe is a tool, a headset, a user interface that consciousness uses for exploration.

**André:** Let's talk about the practical implications. How should this change how we approach problems in the world—whether it's politics, environmental issues, social issues?

**Donald:** The fundamental shift is from seeing ourselves as separate competing entities to seeing ourselves as perspectives of one consciousness. When you make that shift, competition becomes cooperation. Conflict becomes an opportunity for understanding different perspectives.

Think about political disagreements. Right now, we tend to demonize people who disagree with us. We think they're bad people, they're stupid, they're evil. But from this deeper perspective, they're you. They're the same consciousness exploring a different perspective, with different information, different experiences, different fears and hopes.

That doesn't mean all perspectives are equally valid or useful. Some perspectives are more in alignment with reducing suffering, increasing understanding, expanding consciousness. Some perspectives are more contracted, more fearful, more based on illusion. But even the contracted perspectives are consciousness exploring what it's like to be contracted.

And the way you help someone shift from a contracted perspective to a more expanded perspective is not by attacking them, not by making them wrong, but by loving them, by showing them compassion, by helping them feel safe enough to let go of their defenses and open up.

**André:** What about environmental issues?

**Donald:** When you see that you're not separate from nature, that nature is not "out there" but is part of the same consciousness that you are, you naturally treat nature with respect and care. You don't exploit it, you don't destroy it, because you're destroying yourself.

And here's something really important: the idea that nature is just unconscious matter that we can exploit for our purposes—that's a consequence of the materialist worldview. If you think nature is just dead matter, if you think animals are just biological machines, if you think trees and rivers and mountains are just physical objects, then why not exploit them?

But if you recognize that consciousness is fundamental, that everything is consciousness experiencing itself, then you have a completely different relationship to nature. You recognize that animals are conscious beings, that there's something it's like to be a tree, that the whole of nature is alive with consciousness.

Now, that doesn't mean a tree has the same kind of consciousness as a human. The tree doesn't have a brain, doesn't have language, doesn't have the same kind of self-reflective awareness. But it has some form of experience, some form of consciousness. And you treat it accordingly.

**André:** This brings up the question of panpsychism—the idea that everything has consciousness.

**Donald:** What I'm proposing is more radical than traditional panpsychism. Traditional panpsychism says that fundamental particles—electrons, quarks, photons—have little bits of consciousness. And when you put lots of particles together in the right way, you get bigger consciousnesses.

What I'm saying is different. I'm saying that particles in space—electrons, quarks, photons—are not fundamental. They're part of the user interface. They're icons. So it's not that an electron has a little bit of consciousness. Rather, there are conscious agents, and when you look at those conscious agents through the user interface of space and time, they appear as particles.

So consciousness is not a property of physical things. Physical things are how consciousness appears when you look at it through a particular interface.

**André:** So everything we see in space and time—particles, atoms, molecules, cells, brains, bodies—all of that is consciousness appearing in the interface?

**Donald:** That's exactly right. And the interface is not reality. The interface is a simplified, species-specific way of interacting with reality. Other species have different interfaces. A bat experiences the world very differently than we do. A bee experiences the world very differently. They're all looking at the same fundamental reality—consciousness and its interactions—but through different interfaces.

And it's not just different species. Different states of consciousness give you different interfaces. When you're dreaming, you have a different interface. When you meditate deeply, you might have an interface where space and time dissolve. When you take psychedelics, you have a radically different interface. These are all different ways consciousness can experience itself.

**André:** You mentioned earlier that a lot of exploration will be done in silence. Can you say more about that?

**Donald:** The mystical traditions have always emphasized that the deepest understanding comes not from thinking, not from concepts, not from language, but from silence. From simply being. From resting in consciousness itself without the overlay of thoughts and interpretations.

And that makes perfect sense from this framework. Language, concepts, thoughts—these are all part of the interface. They're tools we use to navigate the world of space and time. But they're not the fundamental reality. They're not consciousness itself.

When you sit in silence, when you let the thoughts settle, when you're not trying to grasp or understand or figure anything out, you can begin to experience consciousness directly. Not through the interface, but as it is.

And that's where real wisdom lives. Not in the books, not in the theories, not in the concepts—though those can be useful pointers. But in the direct experience of what you are at the deepest level.

**André:** How does your scientific work relate to your spiritual practice?

**Donald:** For me, they're complementary. The science gives me confidence that this direction is correct, that consciousness is fundamental, that we're all one. The mathematics gives me a rigorous framework for understanding how it could work.

But the science alone isn't enough. I can understand the mathematics of the trace logic, I can understand how spacetime emerges from conscious interactions, I can understand that we're all one consciousness. But understanding it intellectually is not the same as living it, embodying it.

That's where spiritual practice comes in. That's where meditation, contemplation, prayer—whatever practice speaks to you—becomes essential. Because you have to retrain yourself at a deep level. You have to shift from experiencing yourself as a separate body-mind to experiencing yourself as consciousness itself.

And that's hard work. That's why the spiritual traditions talk about it as a path, as requiring dedication and practice. Because you're going against millions of years of evolution that shaped you to feel separate, that shaped you to protect "your" body, to advance "your" interests, to compete with "other" people.

**André:** What do you say to people who find this framework unsettling or even frightening?

**Donald:** I understand that reaction. The idea that the world isn't real, that you're not really a separate person, that space and time are illusions—this can be deeply unsettling. It challenges everything we thought we knew about reality.

But I would say: don't reject it out of fear. Stay with the discomfort. Ask yourself: why is this frightening? Usually, it's because we're attached to our identity as a separate individual. We're attached to our story, our personality, our history, our plans for the future. And this framework seems to threaten all of that.

But here's the thing: you don't lose anything real. The experiences you've had are still real—they really happened. The people you love are still real—they're still consciousness experiencing itself, just like you are. The difference is you gain a much deeper perspective on what's real and what's illusory.

And ultimately, I think most people who really sit with this framework find it liberating rather than frightening. Because if you're not just this small, vulnerable, temporary body, if you're actually infinite, eternal consciousness—that's extraordinarily liberating. You can't really die. You can't really be harmed at the deepest level. You're the source of everything.

**André:** What about people who say this framework makes life meaningless? If it's all just a game, a headset, why does anything matter?

**Donald:** That's a misunderstanding. Just because space and time are a user interface doesn't mean they don't matter. Just because your body is an icon doesn't mean you should neglect it or harm it. The experiences you have are real experiences. The suffering you feel is real suffering. The joy you feel is real joy.

The point is not to dismiss the interface as meaningless. The point is to understand its nature so you can use it wisely. When you play a video game, you know it's not ultimately real. But while you're playing, you still try to win, you still feel excited when you accomplish something, you still enjoy the experience.

Similarly, while you're wearing the headset of space and time, while you're experiencing this life, you should engage fully. You should love deeply, create beautifully, help others, reduce suffering, expand consciousness. All of that matters. All of that is part of the exploration.

The difference is you do it without the crushing fear of death, without the desperate clinging to outcomes, without the bitter resentment when things don't go your way. You do it with more lightness, more joy, more love. Because you know at a deep level that you're safe, that you're infinite, that you can't ultimately be harmed.

**André:** This reminds me of the Bhagavad Gita—the idea of doing your duty without attachment to the fruits of your actions.

**Donald:** Exactly. The great spiritual texts have been pointing to this all along. Do your best in the world. Act with love and integrity. But don't be attached to outcomes. Don't think your worth or your safety depends on whether you succeed or fail, whether you're praised or criticized, whether you live or die.

You're consciousness itself. You're the source. You're infinite and eternal. From that perspective, you can engage fully in life without being crushed by it. You can care deeply about others without being destroyed when you lose them. You can work hard without being devastated when you fail.

**André:** What gives you hope for the future of humanity?

**Donald:** What gives me hope is that the truth is emerging from multiple directions. Science—evolutionary game theory, quantum mechanics, spacetime physics—is pointing toward consciousness being fundamental. Spiritual traditions from around the world have been saying this for millennia. And more and more people are having direct experiences through meditation, psychedelics, near-death experiences that confirm this.

The materialist paradigm is dying. Not because anyone's attacking it or trying to destroy it, but because it simply can't explain the evidence. It can't explain consciousness. It can't explain the observer in quantum mechanics. It can't explain why spacetime breaks down at the Planck scale. It can't provide a theory of everything.

And as the materialist paradigm dies, a new paradigm is being born—a paradigm where consciousness is primary, where we're all one, where the universe is not dead matter but living consciousness exploring itself. And I think as more people wake up to this understanding, we'll see profound changes in how we relate to each other and to the world.

**André:** One of the most powerful things you said earlier was about Jesus on the cross saying "Forgive them, they don't know what they're doing." Can you say more about that?

**Donald:** That's the deepest spiritual truth I know. Here's someone being tortured to death in the most cruel way people could devise, and his response is not anger, not bitterness, not revenge. It's forgiveness and compassion.

"Forgive them, they don't know what they're doing."

That's the heart of Christianity—the real Christianity, not the judgmental, angry, hateful version that some people promote. The real message is: no judgment, complete compassion, complete love for your enemies, love for everyone, especially those who are suffering and in need.

And it only makes sense from this deeper perspective we've been talking about. The people who were killing Jesus—they were him. They were the same consciousness exploring what it's like to be ignorant, to be afraid, to be cruel. And his response was not to judge them but to have compassion for them, to forgive them, to love them.

Now, I'm not saying I'm anywhere near Jesus. If I was on the cross, I'm sure I'd be pissed off. But I'm saying that's where my own theory says I should go—to that transcendent way of being. Hoffman's emotions are not there. My mind is saying here's the theory that's going to take me there. I have a lot of spiritual growing up to do, and all of us do.

But that's where the deep part of Christianity and any true religion is. It's not in killing the unbelievers, being angry with people who disagree with you. It's forgiving them in the very moment in which they're hurting you.

And if we do that, our country will be a very different kind of country.

**André:** That's a different level of compassion—when you hold the awareness that actions come from a place of unconsciousness or unawareness, where it's really hurting the person doing it as well as other people.

**Donald:** Exactly. You can have compassion for seeing people as phenomena unto themselves. If you see somebody who does a horrific thing and hurts a lot of people, but then you come to find out they have a brain tumor pressing on their amygdala, it puts a different context into the picture. You think: okay, I can have more compassion—there wasn't full agency there.

And I think you can extrapolate that all the way down. There are many different forces within us that we would not say are consciously chosen—circumstances we were raised in, genetics, experiences we had. People need to be held responsible for their actions, and still we get to have more compassion for all of the experiences that led them to the point where they would do those things.

**André:** Jesus was very clear about this in Matthew chapter 7—"Judge not."

**Donald:** Absolutely. He couldn't be clearer. "Judge not, period." No exceptions. He just said don't judge other people, period. And he didn't say judge yourself either. He said notice—notice the speck that's in your eye, but don't judge your brother or sister for the speck that's in their eye. Notice the log that's in your own eye.

So it's: don't judge others, don't judge yourself—just notice. And as soon as you notice, you're not stuck in it. "Oh yeah, I'm afraid. Oh yeah, I was mistreating that person. Oh, I was judging that person." So I'm not going to judge myself because I was judging you. I'm just going to notice.

And that's: "Okay, I wanted to kill all those people because they—" Well, okay, I'm not going to beat myself up. Okay, I just noticed I was very angry. I wanted to beat you. Okay, is Jesus mad at me? No. He wasn't mad at the people who were killing him. So he's not mad at me.

It's a very different place. And the only way it makes sense is to realize that everybody is the source seen from a different perspective. That's the only way it makes sense.

**André:** And for some of us, having the intellectual comprehension of that is supportive. And then for many, the taste or the experience of that being so—through meditative, contemplative practices—moves the needle more. We can take it where we get it. All of it's welcome.

**Donald:** Absolutely. And someone who's a slow learner like me has to do both.

**André:** I'm right there with you, Don. I am always so fulfilled by the conversation that we get to have. It's such an honor honestly to be able to have this discussion, explore the emerging discoveries you're working on, when you get fired up about all of it, and then all the implications for how it changes when we leave these chairs and when people turn off this podcast—to move through life with a bit more empathy, with a bit more understanding, with a bit more awe and curiosity. And I think that's a great thing.

**Donald:** It was a great pleasure. Thank you very much, André.

**André:** Is there anywhere you want to point people to? Any last things that are coming out or where do you want to point people toward if they want to get more familiar with you, your work?

**Donald:** My book, "The Case Against Reality," is more about the evolutionary side. There's a little chapter about consciousness being fundamental at the very end. And I'm working on papers on the trace logic—one mathematical and so forth. So there's nothing yet on the trace logic that people can read. This is my first time I've really been this deep in public with the trace logic.

I'm hoping within a couple months there will be something out there that I can give to you and you can send it to your audience—actual publications. So this is actually earlier even before my publications are out on it.

**André:** I feel very grateful to get early access to some of the papers and things that you're sharing. It's so fascinating.

**Donald:** Thank you.

**André:** Thank you everybody for tuning in to this episode of the Know Thyself podcast. Let us know in which ways this was impactful to you and I'll see you next time. Thanks, Don.

**Donald:** Thank you.
