**DWARKESH:** Today I have the pleasure of chatting with Joseph Henrich, who is a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard University and the author of two of my favorite books, *The Weirdest People in the World* and, before that, *The Secret of Our Success*. I remember reading that many years ago when I was in college, and at the time, I didn't think I would get a chance to ask you questions about it.

The most proximal reason I wanted to interview you is that I recently had your colleague David Reich on, and we were discussing certain things in the record of human history. He said, "Eventually, you're just going to have to have Joseph Henrich on and ask him these questions, because he's the one who would know." So let me ask you one of the questions which I was super intrigued by—something he raised that we didn't come up with an answer to.

He's discovered through genetic evidence that 70,000 years ago, across Eurasia, there were so many different human species: the Denisovans, the Neanderthals, the Hobbits. And then apparently there's this one group, potentially the size of 1 to 10,000 people in the Near East, which subsequently explodes. Now everybody descended from Eurasia descends from this one group. So what happened? What did they figure out?

A typical assumption when people think about this—if you put it in the Paleolithic—is that it must have been some kind of genetic changes. But Reich's lab found no obviously big changes in the DNA, so it's a puzzle. Neanderthals, for example, had larger brains, and in primates, larger brains usually go along with more computational abilities and problem-solving capacity. So the expanding variant out of the Middle East, out of Africa, might actually have been less able at an individual level to process information. But if you look back over the more recent period of human history, it's a story of expansions of different populations.

**JOSEPH:** In Africa, we have the Bantu expansion about 5,000 years ago, which actually eliminates a whole bunch of hunter-gatherer populations that previously existed. We have remnant populations in parts of the Congo, in the Kalahari, and the Hadza in Tanzania. If you look at the Austronesian expansion—the peopling of the Pacific—that was the expansion of one group at the expense of others. And of course, the Neolithic expansion into Europe is another example. Really, human history is a story of these different expansions.

This expansion across Eurasia, which then led to interbreeding—we know it's the same species—humans interbred with Denisovans, Neanderthals, and probably other species. There's a ghost species in there. This could be just institutional changes. If you have institutions that interconnect your population, you can maintain more sophisticated technology. Some paleoanthropologists have speculated—with some evidence—that the expanding populations had projectile weapons: bows and arrows. Humans have periodically gained and lost bows and arrows in different parts of the world. In Australia, bows and arrows were never invented. In the New World, populations probably didn't have bows and arrows initially, but later developed them.

**DWARKESH:** It's fascinating how some technologies you'd think were extremely basic—not having the wheel in the New World, for instance. I guess it kind of makes sense with no domesticated animals, but it's such a striking gap.

**JOSEPH:** Although the New World did have dogs, and you can pull carts with dogs. So I've never really bought that explanation. In the New World, you can use llamas to pull carts as well—people still do that today.

**DWARKESH:** So what's your explanation for why there's no wheels in the New World?

**JOSEPH:** There were actually wheels on Mayan carts and on Mayan toys. My explanation is just the collective brain. Almost every single first invention of something big that we think is important for humans was invented in Eurasia. Eurasia, as Jared Diamond famously pointed out—building on other people's work—is the largest continent by far. It has the biggest population. It's also oriented along an east-west axis, which allows ideas and people to flow more easily. There's a belt, which the historian Ian Morris calls the Lucky Latitudes, running basically from southern China all the way through to the Mediterranean. Ideas are flowing back and forth there across the center of Eurasia. You also ended up with more complex state bureaucracies and the kinds of things that allow you to organize and move people around.

**DWARKESH:** What's the explanation for why the collective brain leads to state capacity? Or is it the other way around?

**JOSEPH:** You can think of institutions that eventually lead to state capacity as just part of the innovative process of the collective brain. If you have more groups experimenting with more different ways of governing groups of people, gradually you get the accumulation of the pieces that you can put together into different kinds of states.

**DWARKESH:** So going back to what happened 70,000 years ago—is the basic answer something like bows, but we don't know exactly what it was?

**JOSEPH:** We definitely don't know exactly what it was. We know the population expanded, and there does seem to be tool indications suggesting more complex technology. Probably technology usually goes along with social organization. If you look at Australia, which is a continent of hunter-gatherers, there's an incredible diversity of material culture across the continent. But Australia got cut off from the rest of the world, so the innovations just couldn't flow in. It's a great natural experiment showing that isolation means your collective brain size is limited to that continent.

**DWARKESH:** Let me pivot to something I find deeply mysterious and you've written about extensively. The most proximal reason I'm interested is I heard about this story that really stuck with me: marooned European explorers regularly starved to death in areas where foragers had thrived for thousands of years. Is that actually documented, or is it folklore?

**JOSEPH:** It's definitely documented. There are accounts from Arctic explorers, Australian explorers, and others who faced incredibly harsh environments. They had guns, steel tools, and all these advantages, and yet they starved because they didn't know which plants were edible or how to hunt and trap animals in that environment. Meanwhile, the foragers in those same environments had accumulated a vast repository of knowledge over generations.

The Inuit, for example, have all these techniques for hunting seal and whale that took generations to develop. If you just show up without that knowledge, you're lost. There's this classic story of shipwreck survivors in Tasmania who, despite being on an island, couldn't figure out how to catch fish. The Tasmanians had techniques for getting shellfish and fish from the water, but the shipwreck survivors couldn't replicate that knowledge.

**DWARKESH:** How do you even discover something like the cassava processing? I know you've mentioned this—there's cassava, which is poisonous if not processed correctly, and the 10-step process for making it safe. How do you stumble upon that through trial and error without poisoning yourself?

**JOSEPH:** That's the key question. This is where the population size comes in. If you have a small population and you're trying things out through trial and error, you're going to poison yourself before you figure it out. But in a large population with cultural transmission, you can have people making small modifications to the technique—slight variations that spread through the population. The ones that work survive; the ones that don't, people stop doing them. It's a form of cultural evolution.

There's also experimentation at the margins. Someone might notice that a particular treatment step seems important, or that a variation in technique has an effect. These observations accumulate. And there's prestige bias—people copy what successful, high-status individuals do. So if someone figures out a better way to do something, it spreads faster.

The genius of the process isn't individual insight into chemistry. It's that you have thousands of people, over thousands of years, making small adjustments and keeping track of what works. That's the collective brain at work.

**DWARKESH:** This raises a question I've been thinking about. Given that brains are expensive—they're metabolically costly—and we're outsourcing cognition to the collective, has the human brain declined in size over the last 10,000 years?

**JOSEPH:** Yes, human brain size has decreased over the last 10,000 years. The average brain size has gone down by about 10 percent. There are a few hypotheses for this. One is that we're actually selecting for docility and conformity rather than innovation. Selection pressures have changed. In a hunter-gatherer context, an innovative individual might have a reproductive advantage because they come up with better tools or strategies. But in a settled agricultural society, the person who questions authority and tries new things might be selected against.

Another hypothesis, which I find compelling, is that we've literally outsourced functions to the collective brain and our culture. If the collective is handling memory, innovation, and decision-making, then there's less selection pressure for maintaining large brains in individuals. You get a bigger return on your metabolic investment by investing in cooperation and language, which lets you tap into the collective brain, than by investing in a larger individual brain.

**DWARKESH:** But wait—hasn't language ability and social cognition also gotten more sophisticated? Those are costly too.

**JOSEPH:** That's true. And that's why I think it's a combination. We haven't necessarily reduced our capacity for language or social coordination. We've perhaps reduced some of the capacities that were needed for survival in smaller groups. In a small band, you need to know a lot of practical information about your environment—where water is, which plants are poisonous, animal behavior. You also need the ability to navigate complex social hierarchies and alliances.

In a modern complex society, you specialize. You don't need to know how to make everything. You need to be able to communicate, cooperate, and learn from others. You also need to be embedded in institutions that allow you to contribute your particular skill. So the selection pressures are different. You're not necessarily getting penalized for having a smaller brain if you're good at fitting into a complex system.

**DWARKESH:** This is fascinating because there's this intuitive sense that modern humans should be smarter than ancestral humans because we've solved harder problems, built more complex societies. But if brain size is declining, maybe that's not the right way to think about it.

**JOSEPH:** Right. The smartness that matters now is different from the smartness that mattered then. In a small hunter-gatherer band, you needed to be able to survive in the environment and navigate social politics. In an agricultural society, you needed to be able to follow instructions, work in hierarchies, and maintain a plot of land. In a modern technical society, you need different skills still.

One of the things I find striking is that when Europeans encountered other cultures—Australian Aboriginals, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders—there were often assumptions of lower intelligence. But what was actually happening was that these people had different knowledge and different skills optimized for their environment and their culture. A European explorer in the Australian outback wasn't smarter; they were just trained differently and had access to different technologies.

---

**DWARKESH:** Let's move to something more speculative. You've thought about AGI. If an AI system were to have perfect learning capabilities and could engage in this kind of cultural accumulation, would it have superhuman cultural learning?

**JOSEPH:** That's a really interesting question. The limiting factor for human cultural evolution has been memory and information transmission. An AGI wouldn't have those limits. It could store and retrieve vast amounts of information instantly. It could model complex systems and do thought experiments at a speed far beyond what humans can do.

But I think there's something else that matters for cultural evolution, which is exploration and innovation at the margin. That requires generating variations—trying new things, making mistakes, learning from failure. An AGI would presumably be good at this too, potentially better than humans because it can run more simulations and learn from hypothetical failures without the actual cost.

What I'm less certain about is whether an AGI would have the kind of social learning capacities that humans have. We learn from prestige bias, from imitation, from paying attention to what high-status individuals do. We learn through language in a particular way. An AGI might develop entirely different mechanisms for knowledge accumulation and transmission. So it might be superhuman, but in ways we can't easily predict because the mechanisms could be alien to how human cultural evolution works.

**DWARKESH:** I want to dig into something that I think is the most interesting part of what you've written about. You've explored how the Catholic Church, in trying to eliminate pagan practices in medieval Europe, actually inadvertently set in motion the chain of events that led to the Industrial Revolution. Walk me through that.

**JOSEPH:** This is the story about kinship and marriage institutions. In medieval Europe, before the Church's influence, kinship systems were intensive. You married close relatives—your cousins. You had strong clan identities. Property stayed within the kinship group. Networks of obligation and loyalty ran through family lines. This is the system you see all around the world in most societies.

The Catholic Church, starting around the 11th century or so, began prohibiting cousin marriage. They pushed the marriage rules outward. They wanted to break these tight kinship networks. Why? One reason was probably theological—they had a particular interpretation of Christian morality. But another reason was practical: the Church wanted to consolidate power. If families were fragmented and kinship networks were broken, people would have weaker loyalty to family and clan, which meant they might have stronger loyalty to the Church.

Over several centuries, this policy had enormous effects. As cousin marriage became taboo, people started marrying outside their kin group. As that happened, property couldn't stay consolidated within the family. It had to be divided. Strict inheritance rules developed. You got nuclear families instead of extended clan structures. 

Now here's where it gets interesting for the Industrial Revolution: these institutions—nuclear families, property rights, inheritance laws, a legal system based on individuals rather than kinship groups—created incentives for investment in property, in capital, in innovation. If you're investing in a business and you know your children will inherit it, you have an incentive to make it more productive. If property is going to be divided among five children, you have an incentive to grow it so there's more to divide.

Meanwhile, the breakdown of intensive kinship networks meant people had to develop other kinds of institutions—guilds, merchant associations, long-distance trade networks. These were based on reciprocal exchange and contract rather than kinship obligation. And these institutions became the foundations for markets and eventually for industrial capitalism.

So the story is: the Catholic Church wanted to consolidate religious authority by breaking kinship networks, and that inadvertently created the institutional conditions for capitalism and industry. The Church intended one thing, but the downstream effects led to something entirely different.

**DWARKESH:** This seems like an enormous claim. What's the evidence that this is actually what happened?

**JOSEPH:** The evidence is somewhat indirect, but it's multifaceted. First, there's the historical record. We know the Church explicitly pushed these marriage prohibitions. We can trace the changing marriage patterns in genealogies and church records. We can see that cousin marriage declined over time in Europe, and more dramatically in Western Europe than Eastern Europe or the Middle East. 

Second, there's cross-cultural evidence. If you compare societies that have intensive kinship systems with those that don't, the ones with nuclear families and individual property rights consistently develop certain kinds of institutions—markets, legal systems based on contracts, higher rates of innovation. This correlation appears across cultures.

Third, there's the comparative history: Europe industrialized first, but also Europe is precisely the place where the Church was most successful in breaking kinship systems. Other regions—China, the Islamic world, India—had strong kinship systems persist longer, and they didn't have the same kind of early industrial development.

Now, I'm not saying kinship breaking was the only factor. There are other institutional developments, technological factors, resource availability. But kinship institutions do seem to have been a major constraint that, once removed, freed up other kinds of social and economic organization.

**DWARKESH:** But China had incredible technological sophistication—printing, gunpowder, the compass. Why didn't China experience the Industrial Revolution first?

**JOSEPH:** That's the key question. China had all this technological sophistication, but it didn't translate into industrial capitalism in the way it did in Europe. One factor is that China remained relatively centralized under imperial authority. The incentive structure was different. A merchant in Europe in the 1500s might invest heavily in a business knowing that his children would inherit it and expand it. But in imperial China, there was more risk that the state might seize your wealth or that political changes would destabilize your enterprise.

Another factor is intellectual. China had a different epistemology—a different way of thinking about evidence and proof. European science developed from a particular tradition of philosophy and logical argumentation that became formalized in the Scientific Method. This created incentives for a different kind of investigation and verification. China had empirical knowledge, but it was organized differently.

There's also the decentralization factor. Europe was fragmented into competing states. This meant ideas could flow from one place to another, and if one state was hostile to an idea or a merchant, you could go to another state. China's centralization meant ideas had less room to spread horizontally. If the imperial authority didn't like something, it was more difficult to find a refuge.

So it's not just kinship institutions. It's kinship institutions plus intellectual traditions, plus political structure, plus geography. But the kinship piece seems crucial because it created the foundation of individual property rights and incentive structures.

**DWARKESH:** I'm wondering whether there's a risk of being too clever with these historical explanations. Could you be retrofitting causality? How do you guard against that?

**JOSEPH:** That's a fair criticism. I do think there's a real risk of that. One check I use is: Can you make predictions with the theory? If the theory is true, what else should you see? 

For the kinship story, predictions would be: societies that undergo similar kinship disruptions should see similar kinds of institutional development. You should see correlations between the breakdown of cousin marriage and the development of markets and legal institutions. You should see that regions with persistent intensive kinship systems should have different economic institutions.

You can test these things. There's been actual research—some of it by me and my colleagues, some by others—that tests these predictions. Not all of them pan out perfectly, but many do. So it's not completely unfalsifiable.

Another check is to look at mechanism. Does the theoretical mechanism actually make sense given what we know about human behavior and institutions? The idea that people have stronger incentives to invest if they control the returns—that's straightforward. The idea that breaking kinship networks creates conditions for other kinds of associations—that makes sense too.

But I'm not claiming certainty here. History is complicated. There are multiple factors. What I'm doing is highlighting one factor that I think has been underappreciated and showing how it might connect to major historical outcomes.

**DWARKESH:** Have there been follow-up studies or work by other researchers that's validated or questioned this theory?

**JOSEPH:** There's been quite a bit of work on it. Some researchers have looked at the relationship between kinship institutions and economic development across different regions and time periods. The patterns generally support the idea that intensive kinship systems are correlated with lower levels of market development and different property institutions.

There's also been work on what's sometimes called WEIRD societies—Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic. These societies tend to have the kind of kinship structures we're talking about, and they also tend to have certain psychological characteristics associated with individual autonomy and abstract thinking. The research suggests that these are connected—that growing up in a society with nuclear families and individual property rights shapes cognition in particular ways.

Others have questioned whether the Church's marriage rules were really the primary cause, arguing that economic and technological factors were more important. That's a fair point. I think it's most accurate to say the kinship disruption was one necessary condition among several others, not the sole cause.

**DWARKESH:** Let me ask about another aspect of cultural evolution: variance. You've talked about how cultural variance has been collapsing in the modern world. What do you mean by that?

**JOSEPH:** One of the key engines of cultural evolution is variation. You have different groups trying different approaches to solving problems—different social structures, different technologies, different ways of organizing. Some work better than others. The successful variants spread; the unsuccessful ones disappear. That's cultural selection.

But in the modern world, we're seeing a flattening of cultural diversity. Globalization means that successful practices—or practices that appear successful, or practices that are most profitable—spread everywhere. You see the same corporate chains, the same technologies, the same cultural products across the world. Indigenous knowledge systems are disappearing. Different ways of organizing society are being replaced by the model that dominates globally.

This is a huge problem for cultural evolution because you need variance to have selection. Without different groups trying different approaches, you lose the opportunity for new innovations to emerge. You also lose the knowledge encoded in different cultural systems.

There's another problem too. When everyone is doing the same thing, you're all subject to the same failure mode. If the dominant approach has a flaw, it fails globally. Whereas if there are multiple approaches, some will be more robust to particular shocks. Diversity is insurance.

**DWARKESH:** Is this a concern that matters if innovation is happening at the technological frontier? Like, even if cultural practices are converging, we might still have diversity of thought among engineers and scientists who are pushing technology forward.

**JOSEPH:** That's an interesting point. You do have some diversity in research and engineering. But I think it's a mistake to assume that technological innovation can happen in isolation from cultural and social context. The way scientists think about evidence, the way engineers approach problems, the institutions that fund and direct research—these are all shaped by culture. 

Also, a lot of the diversity of thought at the frontier is still coming from people embedded in WEIRD societies—Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic. There's much less representation from people with different cultural backgrounds and ways of thinking. Imagine if we had more researchers trained in non-Western philosophical and empirical traditions. The questions they'd ask might be different. The approaches they'd take might be different.

There's also the question of what problems we're solving. A lot of technological innovation is directed toward producing goods and services that fit within the current global capitalist system. There might be entirely different kinds of problems that other cultural systems would prioritize—problems around sustainability, community resilience, different ways of measuring well-being.

So I think cultural homogenization is still a risk even if we have some technological diversity.

**DWARKESH:** You've also written about how we should think about individual genius. Is individual genius real? How much of what we attribute to individual genius is actually cultural evolution?

**JOSEPH:** This is tricky because I don't think individual genius is *not* real. Some people have exceptional abilities. Mozart had remarkable musical talent. Newton had extraordinary mathematical abilities. These aren't trivial.

But what I think is often underappreciated is the cultural context that makes that genius productive. Mozart grew up in a culture with centuries of accumulated musical knowledge and technique. He had access to the works of other composers. He had social institutions that allowed him to perform and develop his skills. Without that cultural foundation, his innate talent might never have developed or been expressed.

Newton worked in a culture that had particular mathematical techniques, particular ways of thinking about physical problems, and particular institutions like universities and the Royal Society that allowed him to do his work and have it recognized.

The research on genius across history suggests that exceptional individuals tend to cluster in particular times and places—periods when there's a lot of cultural ferment and exchange of ideas. The Italian Renaissance, Vienna in the 19th century, early 20th-century physics. These are times and places with lots of communication and exchange. Individual genius and cultural evolution are in dialogue. You need both.

**DWARKESH:** But if it's really all about the cultural context, why don't we see more Newtons and Mozarts? Shouldn't the probability of them appearing scale with population size?

**JOSEPH:** That's a smart question. And there is some scaling with population size. Larger populations do seem to produce more innovations and discoveries. But it's not a simple linear relationship. There are constraints.

One constraint is the distribution of knowledge. If you have a large population but knowledge is poorly distributed—people can't communicate, can't access the works of others—then population size doesn't help much. You need not just a large population but good networks for transmission of ideas.

Another constraint is selection and recognition. Not every talented person becomes a Newton. Some are born in contexts where their talents aren't recognized or valued. Some lack access to education or resources. Some are just unlucky. So there's filtering that happens.

Also, it's possible that the most exceptional outliers do scale with population. We might see more high-IQ individuals and more exceptional achievers in large modern populations than in small historical populations. But genius, to be expressed and have impact, requires the right cultural conditions. So you can have exceptional individuals who never have their impact recognized or realized.

**DWARKESH:** This connects back to the brain size decline question. If we're outsourcing cognition to the collective brain, and individual genius is partly a cultural artifact, then the collapse of brain size might be less concerning than it seems?

**JOSEPH:** I think that's a reasonable interpretation. If we're genuinely better off with a smaller individual brain embedded in a large collective brain than with a larger individual brain in isolation, then the brain size decline might be adaptive. We're trading raw individual computation for better integration with collective knowledge and decision-making.

But there's a risk, which goes back to the variance question. If we're all connected to the same collective brain—the same internet, the same information sources—then we lose the diversity that comes from different groups having different knowledge and different ways of thinking. We get coordination benefits but lose variation benefits.

Also, if the institutions that comprise the collective brain fail—if there's a collapse of communication, a loss of recorded knowledge, a breakdown of institutions—then individual cognitive capacity matters a lot. A person with a larger brain and more internal knowledge would be more resilient than someone who's dependent on external institutions.

---

**DWARKESH:** Let's talk about IQ, which is one of the most contentious topics. You've been careful about this in your writing. How do you think about the relationship between IQ and collective intelligence?

**JOSEPH:** First, I think it's worth being clear about what IQ measures and what it doesn't. IQ tests measure certain cognitive abilities—logical reasoning, pattern recognition, mathematical facility, linguistic skill. They predict performance in certain contexts, particularly academic and professional contexts in modern societies. So IQ is real in that sense.

But IQ is not pure individual intelligence. It's intelligence in a particular cultural context. IQ tests were designed and refined in Western contexts, and they measure the cognitive abilities valued in Western education and professional institutions. If you gave those same tests to people from very different cultural contexts, you'd get different patterns of performance. This doesn't mean people from other contexts are less intelligent; it means intelligence is culturally situated.

There's also the question of whether IQ captures all the cognitive abilities that matter for solving complex problems or achieving meaningful goals. There's strong evidence that creativity isn't strongly predicted by IQ. Social intelligence—the ability to work with others and navigate social complexity—isn't strongly predicted by IQ. Practical problem-solving ability, the kind of intelligence that matters in real-world contexts, shows lower correlation with IQ than you might expect.

So I think it's more accurate to talk about different kinds of intelligence or cognitive abilities, some of which are captured by IQ and some of which aren't.

**DWARKESH:** Given that IQ has some predictive validity for academic and professional success, and if higher IQ people make better scientific discoveries or more creative innovations, shouldn't we expect that selecting for higher IQ in the population would increase innovation and cultural progress?

**JOSEPH:** That's a hypothesis you could test. There's actually interesting evidence on this. In some domains, you do see correlations between population-level IQ—estimated from test scores of students—and economic development or innovation. But the correlations are not as strong as you might expect if IQ were the primary driver.

There are countries with relatively lower average IQ scores that have high rates of innovation in particular domains. And there are high-IQ countries that have lower rates of innovation than you might predict.

I think the reason is that innovation depends on so many other factors beyond individual IQ. It depends on incentive structures. Are there reward systems for innovation? Do you have property rights that let people benefit from inventions? It depends on education institutions and how well they transmit knowledge. It depends on whether there's an open exchange of ideas or censorship. It depends on whether minority opinions are valued or suppressed.

There's research by my colleague in the genetics of IQ suggesting that even if you could increase average IQ in a society, it might lead to more abstract thinking and potentially better science. That certainly fits. But the interesting thing for me is that the world of the future is going to be quite different than the one now. The set of cognitive abilities favored in an AI world isn't going to be the same set that was favored in 1900 when they designed the IQ test.

For example, IQ tests ask you to remember digits backwards. I'm not sure how useful remembering lists of digits backwards is. It was in a world where we had to write everything down and remember a lot. But now we're interfacing with technology, and we need to figure out what cognitive abilities are actually going to make people best at solving problems.

And as we talked about earlier, the most creative people aren't necessarily the highest IQ people. The minds that might lead us into the new world might not be the ones with the highest IQ because, once you're augmented with AI and technological tools, the specialized abilities that lead to creativity might not be the same as what mattered in 1910.

**DWARKESH:** Let me push back on that a bit. My real opinion is that if we're in a world where AI is doing everything, then it really doesn't matter because AIs will be doing everything. But in a world where, say, AI plateaus or something, then I'd expect the same kinds of skills that have mattered for the last couple of centuries to keep mattering for a modern technological society—analytical thinking and the ability to understand science and technology.

But maybe the AI world you're imagining is different than the one I'm imagining. I still think people are going to figure out what problems we need to solve, unless we're just going to tell the AIs to figure out what problems are and then solve them.

**JOSEPH:** They might not be that good at that.

**DWARKESH:** Right. So in that world, analytical thinking and domain expertise would still matter a lot. The question then is whether population-level increases in IQ would help with that.

**JOSEPH:** That's a fair point. If people are still directing AI systems and figuring out what problems to solve, then having people with better analytical abilities would help. I'm not denying that IQ correlates with analytical ability. My point is more that it's not the whole story. And that the skills that will matter most might be different from what we think.

You shared with me a draft of work about collective brains, where you show that ants have developed many technologies that humans have—farming, livestock, division of labor. There's some amount of blind selection, and it doesn't matter if it's natural selection or cultural selection. The size of the group that can go through this learning process matters, and how many people are available to experience learnings or have selection act on them.

I guess the big difference where individual IQ comes back into the picture is that I don't expect there to be any amount of natural selection that would allow ants to land on the moon or make a computer chip or do nuclear fusion. So is the kind of broad generalization we see with humans, and we might see to an even greater extent with AI, a product of being bottlenecked by the IQ of the individual? Is there no amount of collective learning that gets you to the moon if you're an ant?

**JOSEPH:** Well, one thing to keep in mind is that most human societies over most of human evolutionary history didn't get to the moon. This is one particular group of humans. One of the things we talked about earlier was the cultural evolution of epistemology—improvements in what constitutes evidence and what constitutes a good argument, which allows us to get to science and accumulate this kind of knowledge to do these kinds of things.

I see that as part of a continuous trajectory. But we have new cognitive tools.

**DWARKESH:** I guess, but there's a really interesting point that even the epistemic tools that let us get to the moon are themselves a product of cultural evolution. But that seems bottlenecked by the fact that if you're dealing with chimpanzees, there's no amount of cultural evolution that will result in the scientific method.

**JOSEPH:** Right, it needs some gene-culture co-evolution.

**DWARKESH:** Right. You mentioned in *The Secret of Our Success* that tool use started something like two million years ago, and fire—we started domesticating it closer to 800,000 to a million years ago. Intuitively, it doesn't seem like tool use is that much simpler than fire, but why was fire so much more recent?

**JOSEPH:** Well, what we know from other species is that lots of animals use tools, particularly chimpanzees. So we can assume tools were in the common ancestor. What we see in the paleoanthropological record is the increasing use of stone tools—pretty simple stone tools with a cutting edge but not much fancier than that.

Fire is different because lots of animals are afraid of fire. They have to run from wildfires. So whatever your story about humans is, you have to overcome the fear of fire to tame it. Humans probably first found wild fire, and somebody approached it instead of running away, which is the usual thing to do. Then they got some of it and put it to use.

I think it's the innate fear that animals have of fire. We don't hang around when things go on fire.

**DWARKESH:** That's fascinating. What's the next thing you're working on?

**JOSEPH:** The big thing is a book on collective brains. I'm gradually working through that. One of the ideas I'm really excited about is that we evolved to think in collectives. There's an assumption that psychologists have held—to understand human decision-making and how our minds solve problems—which is that we should put people by themselves in experiments and see how they do. But real human societies, hunter-gatherers—they work in groups. When we want to solve a problem, the first thing we do is check with our friends or ask other expert members of the community.

It's the idea that we think collectively and solve problems collectively in a kind of naturally distributed brain. Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber, for example, have argued and shown with various lines of evidence that many of the irrational biases we have mitigate or disappear entirely when we solve problems as groups. It's almost like we evolved to have that positive interaction and correct each other's errors.

**DWARKESH:** That's interesting—you care more about the portfolio of intelligences than any one person being calibrated.

**JOSEPH:** Right. Exactly.

**DWARKESH:** This has been super fun. Thanks so much for coming on the podcast.

**JOSEPH:** Great to be with you.
