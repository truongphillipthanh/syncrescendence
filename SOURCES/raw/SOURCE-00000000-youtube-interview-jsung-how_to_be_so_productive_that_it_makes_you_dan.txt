In this video, I'm going to share with you three powerful productivity principles that allow you to get so much
0:05
work done compared to everyone else that it makes you dangerous. These are principles that I use to finish medical
0:11
school and work as a doctor while running a business full-time and the same principles that I coach to my
0:17
thousands of students and professionals. The three principles are number one the performance paradox, number two the
0:25
obvious target trap, and number three the marginal gains fallacy. And
0:34
mastering these three principles makes you dangerously productive. We're talking about those people that you meet
0:41
and you just feel like you cannot compete with them. Every time you see them, they are effortlessly making
0:48
progress in their life. They are not doing two steps forward, one step back like the rest of us. Somehow, every step
0:56
is taking them forward. And they're also not stressed and frazzled. They are calm and focused and somehow just getting
1:04
everything done like a machine. And actually, the reason that they're able to be like that is because of the first
1:11
principle, which is the performance paradox. Here's what I've learned. If you want to be productive, you need to
1:17
have a product. Productivity is basically how efficiently the stuff you
1:22
do leads to your intended product. Now, this product, it could be passing an
1:29
exam, it could be getting a a job, getting a promotion, or it could be
1:34
bigger than that. Maybe it's a series of exams, or maybe it's your not just a job, it's your entire career path. Or
1:41
maybe it's bigger than that. Maybe the desired goal, your product is just to
1:46
live an intentional life, doing the things you want to do,
1:51
being the person you want to be, feeling fulfilled and free. But whatever it is, the way we measure productivity has to
1:59
be based on the things that allow us to achieve that goal and create that
2:05
product. And the difference between someone who is highly productive, dangerously productive, versus someone
2:11
who is just busy is that the busy person is spending their time doing a lot of
2:17
stuff. But the productive person is spending their time doing stuff that's meaningful to them. So if you look at a
2:24
really busy person, they might be like this is the person. They're just like vibrating. They they're constantly just
2:31
doing something. there's a lot of energy going in all sorts of different directions. Whereas someone that's
2:36
really productive, they may not need to do so much, but everything they do is
2:42
purposeful. And so with much less effort, they're actually able to make more consistent progress towards their
2:48
goals. I remember when I was younger in my late teens and early 20s where I was
2:54
really on top of that productivity train and I was trying to optimize absolutely everything and make myself more
2:59
productive and I I lost sight of why I wanted to be productive. I just got sucked into this trap of being busy that
3:07
I started feeling that as long as I'm doing stuff and I'm being busy with things that on the surface seem
3:14
productive therefore I must be productive. But a lot of the times the things that on the surface seem
3:20
productive are not actually the best things that you can be spending that time doing. A great example of that is
3:26
just getting enough sleep or taking a break or just planning things. These are
3:31
things that I typically was a bit impatient with. I didn't feel that it was very important. It didn't feel like
3:37
I was busy and moving and making progress. And so I deprioritized that. I thought it's more productive for me to
3:44
be spending my time taking action and doing stuff. But that's a very narrow and I would even say naive way of
3:50
thinking about achieving a goal or achieving a product because human beings are not machines. And so when it comes to something like rest, rest is an
3:57
integral part of not only what keeps you in the game long enough to achieve the goal, but also helps you to do that more
4:04
efficiently and more optimally, which means the more fuel and effort you put in, the better the result you get out of
4:10
it is. If you are a professional race car driver, you care a lot about
4:16
maintaining your car. And you can imagine some gung-ho young racer that's
4:21
coming in and planning on driving their car until it catches fire. That's a very shortsighted way of thinking about
4:29
achieving a goal. And here's the thing, because you I had that mentality when I was trying to enter into medical school.
4:34
My primary goal at that time was entering into medical school. and I was driving that car until it was on fire.
4:41
But after you achieve that goal, there's another goal. And that goal is probably harder. And now you're on fire. You're
4:48
burnt out. And so an interesting perspective is to extend your goals out. See the bigger product. So let's say
4:55
that this circle is where you are right now and the star is where you want to get to eventually. If you've got a
5:01
short-term goal, let's say that this is, you know, one year, 6 months. Honestly,
5:07
there's actually a lot of ways that you can achieve that short-term goal. You don't have to be perfectly optimized.
5:12
You can be doing all sorts of things and you'll still eventually get there. But as you extend that goal out further and
5:18
further, longer duration of time, increasing level of challenge, there are
5:23
fewer paths that get you to that goal. And so even if there is a way that you
5:31
can achieve a short-term goal, does that put you in a position where it's actually harder for you now to achieve the long-term goal? Because remember,
5:38
there are a lot of ways to achieve the short-term goal. And constantly thinking about productivity in terms of
5:44
short-term bursts and only short-term goals will start developing habits and systems and processes that don't go the
5:52
distance. that will damage your sustainability, increase your risk of burnout, and eventually be extremely
5:57
counterproductive. And something that's become clearer and clearer to me the busier I've gotten, and this is the
6:03
reason why I call it the performance paradox, is that in order to get more product, you often need to do less. The
6:11
major difficulty, especially over time, is not whether you can keep yourself busy. It's not about whether you can
6:17
execute on things. It's about whether you're executing on the things that really make a difference. And if you're
6:23
not executing on the things that make a difference, sometimes it's better just to not execute at all. Save that energy,
6:30
rest, recover, spend time with your family and your friends. Just like have an enjoyable experience of life. If
6:37
you're in a race to get to the finish line, you have to recognize that you are not just a driver in the vehicle. You
6:43
are the vehicle. You are the driver. You are the fuel. You are everything that is
6:49
going to take you to that goal, which means you have to take care of yourself. It's a lesson I've learned the hard way
6:55
that the more you care about the goal, the more of a responsibility you have to take care of yourself. And there are
7:01
very few ways that you can take care of yourself. And do yourself a favor that
7:06
is better than joining my free newsletter. I mean, imagine that. I have over a decade of experience coaching
7:13
thousands of people. I've seen so many mistakes that other people make and I
7:18
know how to solve those. Imagine if you could just get into my mind and then
7:24
take those core principles like I'm giving you in this YouTube video, but it's just sent to your inbox every
7:29
single week for free, perfectly distilled, written with my fingers. Is that a dream? No. It's my newsletter.
7:36
But seriously, I do go through things that I think are pretty insightful that will help a lot of you who are struggling with productivity and
7:43
learning. So if you want to sign up to that, I'll leave a link to the newsletter in the description below. So
7:48
that was the performance paradox. And the takeaway from that is sometimes less is more. And that is exactly the theme
7:55
of the second principle here, which is the obvious target trap. When I was going through uni and I had all my
8:02
lecture schedules and then I had my work and business related activities and I had all of these different tasks thrown
8:08
around like on a notebook and then on my phone and I was looking for a way to
8:13
consolidate all of that into like a a single app that would allow me to sort of get my head around all my
8:19
productivity issues. But there was no single app that I found that did that very well. And so I had sort of three or
8:25
four different apps that I'd connect together and I created my own little ecosystem. And I honestly took a lot of
8:30
pride in that ecosystem of apps that I developed because that system worked so
8:35
well for me in managing all my different tasks in my schedules. It felt efficient. Ironically, what I realize
8:41
now is that at that time I had fallen into the obvious target trap. The
8:46
obvious target trap is when you think that there is a problem, usually a very obvious problem, and then you see an
8:53
obvious way to fix that problem. And so you dedicate time and invest resources
8:59
and effort into fixing that problem. But this can actually be an incredible waste
9:05
of time, potentially the biggest, most problematic type of wasted time. Here's
9:11
what happened with my apps. One of the apps got updated. It no longer connected
9:16
with the other app I had it with. And then that made me not use those apps for
9:21
like a few weeks. And a few weeks later, I kind of forgotten how it all comes
9:26
together because it was so complicated that then I just stopped using it. And then because I'd stopped using it, but
9:32
my entire life was on there. I had like hundreds of backlog tasks and schedules
9:37
that were thrown around there that I had to manually then reexport out, funnily enough, back to just Google Calendar.
9:44
And now this is not a Google Calendar sponsor segment. Not that Google Calendar needs a sponsor, but the idea
9:49
here is that simplicity is really king. If you ask me now what my productivity
9:55
system is, there's three things. A calendar app, the notes app on my phone,
10:00
and a lit like sticky notes, literally sticky notes
10:08
that I just write stuff on and, you know, with my hands and I just look at it with my eyes. Very, you know, ancient
10:15
technology. And the reason is that I don't need anything more than that. It's very easy
10:21
in the productivity space to overoptimize on obvious targets, things
10:26
that you see a small problem with and you can obviously make that better like
10:32
a new app or a fancy notion template. But the thing is, I really doubt that
10:38
you or me with the fanciest notion templates and the newest apps is
10:45
unlocking this level of productivity that has just never been reached by any person in humankind before us. There
10:51
have been really impressive people doing really impressive, productive things for
10:57
hundreds of years. And so the core issue with this obvious target trap is that it all just comes down to a lack of proper
11:06
prioritization. When you learn to prioritize really well, 90% of your
11:12
productivity problems will be solved. It's not going to come from time blocking. It's not going to come from a
11:18
new app. It's not going to come from the way you do your schedule. It's not going to come from a Pomodoro timer. It's
11:23
going to come from just not wasting your time on things you shouldn't be doing in
11:29
the first place. And this concept of prioritizing effectively ties in directly with the predto principle. So
11:35
if you're aware of the predto principle, the idea is sometimes it's called the 8020 rule. The idea with the predto
11:41
principle or the 8020 rule is that 20% of the stuff you do is going to make 80% of the impact. Well, the other way to
11:47
think about this is that if you've got a list of, let's say, 10 things that you're trying to do, then without
11:53
prioritizing, you have got an 80% chance of wasting your time on the stuff that
11:59
does not move the needle. So, your job is not to look at this list of stuff and just smash them out as quickly as
12:05
possible. Your job is to look at this list and ask yourself, what are the key
12:12
levers? What are the things that if I were to work on get me closer to the
12:17
product, my overall goal as effectively as possible? Ask yourself that question
12:23
and figure out what the 20% of the tasks that are worth doing actually are and
12:29
actively reject the rest. These things that are not the key levers, they are
12:35
not worth your cognitive bandwidth. they
12:41
are not worth your mental attention and your time to optimize because the opportunity cost. What you could be
12:47
doing instead is working on this stuff and these are the things that are going to push you forward towards your goal.
12:54
And when you see that dangerously productive person, chilling out, looking relaxed, coming to the parties, and
13:01
socializing, and you're wondering, how do you get so much done when you never seem to be busy? It's because they're
13:07
spending the 20% of their time doing the stuff that really matters. It's not that they've got less stuff to do. They are
13:13
choosing to do less stuff, which performance paradox gets them more
13:18
result. Same principle with your productivity system or the apps that you use. I decided that the only apps I need
13:25
is something to track my schedule, a calendar, and something to track my thoughts, a paper or the notes app. And
13:31
I built a solid mental framework around how I use those two things. I doubled
13:36
down on the key levers and I focused on creating simplicity. Now, I teach
13:42
prioritization a lot and prioritization frameworks. And what I've personally seen is that the average person is not
13:49
very skilled at prioritizing. Part of it is that some people don't have the frameworks, but actually the bigger part
13:55
is that even when people have the frameworks, I found that they're usually not using them in the way that they need
14:01
to be. And so I want to give you a quick tutorial on how to do prioritization
14:06
really effectively. I'll give you a super quick practical framework that you can use and then the common pitfalls
14:11
that I've noticed stop people from using those frameworks. And if you've ever struggled with prioritization yourself
14:17
and you've tried it in your own life, then you'll probably resonate with these pitfalls. So the first thing that I want
14:22
to give you is the framework. The simplest one I think is the or not and
14:28
framework. You've got a lot of stuff to do. Someone asks you, hey, you want to get a coffee, get some pizza? You have
14:35
to think, cool, I could do that and then I can fit time, do my other tasks
14:40
afterwards, and then I can go for my jog after this. No, no, no. The way you think about it is I can do that or I can
14:49
do this other thing in my priority list. Everything that you decide to commit to
14:54
has an opportunity cost. Sometimes the opportunity cost is purely your own
14:59
freedom, peace of mind, relaxation, and that could be extremely important. That could be the key lever for you that day.
15:06
And so the or not and framework simply says when you're confronted with a new
15:11
possible task or commitment to do instead of accepting it ask yourself
15:16
what will you sacrifice in order to fit that in. Figure out what you're willing to lose. And by doing this one of two
15:24
things is going to happen. Either you are correct. You genuinely did not have
15:30
time to do both of those things. It's a good idea for you to have thought or not and and picked your loss very
15:37
intentionally or you finish things faster than you expected and you do get time to do more
15:44
than that and then you can just do it. You can just add that on and still get it done. There's genuinely no downside
15:51
to thinking about it as or not and and connecting yourself with what you are intending to lose. But when you don't do
15:59
this, that's when you end up with this overwhelming amount of stuff that you're constantly juggling and you never feel
16:05
like you have time to do everything because you don't have time to do everything. The issue is that you're not connecting to the fact that you don't
16:12
have time and you have to pick something to get rid of. Which brings me to the first major pitfall, which is that
16:20
correct prioritization should feel bad. If you are even
16:26
remotely newish to prioritizing and it doesn't feel bad, you are
16:32
probably okay, there's only three situations here. Number one, it feels
16:38
bad because there are important things that you want to do that you're actively saying no to. Feels bad or it feels good
16:47
because you don't have many things going on in your life. So, you can basically say yes to anything and it's all easy.
16:53
That's not the case for most people, especially most people watching a video about how to be more productive. Or
16:58
number three, it doesn't feel bad because you're stuck at prioritizing and you're not connecting with the pain of
17:04
what you're losing. In which case, it's going to feel bad for you eventually when you're not able to keep on top of all of your commitments and you realize
17:10
you're falling behind. So either way, not prioritizing feels bad. Prioritizing
17:15
feels bad. The difference is that when you prioritize, even though it feels bad, you are in control of your
17:22
priorities and your life. You are deciding where to put your time and your attention and your mental energy. And
17:28
over time, what will happen is that even though it initially feels bad, you will realize that hey, even though it feels
17:35
bad because you're saying no to something, you are at the same time saying yes to something else that was
17:41
actually more important for you. And when you feel the the benefit of having
17:47
said yes to that, that's going to make you feel good. And eventually, this feedback loop is going to over time make
17:54
it so that when you say no to something, you don't feel bad about it anymore because you connect that with what
18:00
you're truly saying yes to. and that deep sense of fulfillment and
18:05
satisfaction that you are really deliberately and intentionally taking control of your life that is a feeling
18:12
that goes beyond just feeling good or feeling bad. So that's the that's the first common pitfall is that people
18:18
don't feel bad enough or they avoid feeling bad. The second thing is that
18:23
when you're prioritizing correctly, your task priorities should not be the same
18:30
as your values. If every time you come to prioritize your tasks, you're doing
18:35
it based on the priority of your values, that means that every single day there are certain tasks that are always going
18:41
to be prioritized higher and then certain tasks that are always going to be prioritized lower. So that is actually going to create an imbalance of
18:47
your priorities. That makes it very binary. It means that the one or two most important things in your values
18:53
receive all of the attention and everything else is constantly put off and that is going to create a lot of
19:01
value dissonance in you because you are constantly saying no to things that are genuinely important to you. And so the
19:08
way that priorities and values balance out is that on a daily basis, your
19:13
priorities should reflect the context and situation and what is important for you in that short-term period like for
19:20
those few days. Balance out your values across weeks. So let's say you really
19:26
value spending time with a certain friend. That's fine. Spend time with that friend, but you don't have to spend
19:32
time with that friend every single day. You say no to the friend on Monday. You say no to the friend on Tuesday, you
19:38
make up for it on the Wednesday or the Thursday or the Friday or the next week. And saying no to one of your values on
19:45
any given day is not likely to lead to a meaningful consequence in a short amount
19:50
of time. Your values are more like a compass. Whereas your task priorities is more like the road you're going to take.
19:57
And so I would recommend spending active time at least at the beginning maybe 15
20:03
to 30 minutes a day depending on how much stuff you have to prioritize to actively sit down go through all of your
20:09
tasks and use this or not and framework to be very clear about where your key levers are what you're saying no to and
20:16
just re-evaluate your values and your priorities. Ask yourself, have I fallen into the obvious target trap where I'm
20:24
spending time on things that I think are obvious things for me to work on when actually when you take a step back,
20:30
that's not the thing that's going to make the biggest difference. FYI, for me personally, I usually review my task
20:36
priorities and rep prioritize every day. And if I'm really really busy and there's lots of stuff on my plate, I
20:41
might rep prioritize it even twice a day. So that's on a daily or weekly basis. I also recommend that you do this
20:48
prioritization and you take a step back. You think about whether you have fallen into the obvious target trap on a longer
20:54
term scale as well. Maybe once every 3 to 6 months and this is because it's very easy to get tunnel vision relating
21:01
to your priorities. So years ago I was involved in the medical entry space like
21:07
helping people enter into medical school. And so these students are very motivated entering into medical school.
21:12
They're going through medical school. they're studying. Even from the very first time I meet them and I ask them, "Hey, why do you want to be a doctor?"
21:20
They give some generic answer, but they're not really sure. And I can tell they're kind of just convincing
21:26
themselves. They go through medical school, this question still lingers in the back of their mind. They become a
21:31
doctor, it's still lingering, and then 15 years later, they're messaging me saying, "Hey, Justin, how did you manage
21:38
to leave being a doctor because I hate my job now?" And it's the exact same
21:43
concerns that they had 10 plus years ago that they just never addressed. That's
21:48
an example, maybe an extreme example, but honestly really common of an obvious target trap just dominating for like a
21:56
whole era of your life. You know, I said that nothing wastes more time than just doing the wrong thing. Well, this is an
22:03
example where someone has entered an entire career path, spent 10 plus years of their life on something and then
22:10
realized that it was the wrong thing to be doing because 10 years ago they
22:16
didn't ask themselves this question. Is this entire pathway the road that I'm
22:22
on? Is that the right road that I want to be on? Or is that road just the
22:28
obvious target that I latched on to years ago? And the only reason I'm still on this obvious target road is because
22:36
to challenge that feels too insecure. There's too much of my identity tied up
22:42
in it and it's too destabilizing. Well, it doesn't get any easier the longer you
22:47
leave it. If you're driving on a road trip and you feel like you're getting lost, you don't keep driving until you
22:53
just see where you end up before you check the map. So, that's the obvious target trap. And by the way, if this is
23:00
a concept that resonated with you, I talk about a little bit more in one of my newses as well. So, just a reminder,
23:05
the link to that is in the description. The third principle here is the marginal
23:11
gains fallacy. Did you know if you get 1% better every single day for 365 days,
23:20
one year, you would be 37 times better than you are today. That is the crux of
23:27
the marginal gains concept. It was made famous, I think probably by James CLA in his book atomic habits. That's where a
23:34
lot of people are exposed to this concept. And you know, the idea is that these 1% gains are compounding. So even
23:40
though it you know you're not really making much progress in these early days over time it stacks up and stacks up
23:45
until you are you know multiple times better than you are now. And there's a lot of power and a lot of truth to this
23:52
concept most of the time for whatever goal you're trying to reach.
23:57
This is not going to be done in like one single line, one single shot. As you
24:02
progress and every step you take, you are constantly going to have to make micro optimizations to your processes
24:08
and to your systems to keep you focused and on track and productive. And every time you make that micro adjustment,
24:14
that's a 1% change. But this is the part about this marginal gains framework that
24:20
I don't see a lot of other people talking about, which is interesting to me because this is actually the thing
24:26
that I see more commonly, which is that you can make a 1% gain every single day
24:32
to slowly get better. But you can also make a 1% change that makes you
24:38
continually worse. And so every day you're just getting 1% worse. Or what's more common is that every single day you
24:45
make a 1% change, but you're not really moving at all. You're just kind of changing back and forth, up and down,
24:50
and fluctuating. And the difference between the person that is marginally gaining versus the person that is
24:57
marginally getting worse or the person that's marginally static and fluctuating. The difference is data.
25:05
It's metrics. It's the feedback you get from the optimization that you're
25:10
making. When you make an optimization and you get feedback on whether that was a good or a bad optimization, that tells
25:16
you how to adjust your optimization next time or whether that is even a worthwhile optimization to continue
25:22
with. The marginal gains fallacy is making 1% changes every single day
25:29
believing that just because you make a 1% change, it is going to result in
25:34
cumulative gain. In reality, you only get the gain when you measure
25:41
what matters. I'm going to take an obvious example from learning. Let's say
25:46
that someone's spending a lot of time learning, like lots and lots of hours a day. So, their primary metric they're
25:52
going to use is hours of studying per day. So, hours of studying per day. Very
25:59
easy to track and get feedback on. So they're going to make an optimization to try to reduce the amount of hours of
26:05
studying per day. So let's say that they were originally writing lots and lots of notes. And so to reduce the amount of
26:11
time that they're spending, they're going to use an AI to summarize the notes for them. So they're able to now
26:17
cut their hours of study down from let's say 10 hours a day to 5 hours a day. So
26:23
based on this metric, this is a great success. And so further optimizations
26:28
should continue to build this marginal gain. Except this would be probably a
26:35
terrible idea because the reason that they're learning in the first place is not to fill the hours in their day. The
26:41
reason that they're learning is to pass an exam or to have expertise, have knowledge in their memory. So their true
26:49
outcomes that actually matter for them are knowledge retention in their memory
26:54
and knowledge depth or expertise slash the ability to apply what they've
26:59
learned. These are the things that actually matter that they should be testing on. So probably what would end
27:06
up happening is that by using AI to summarize these notes and therefore bypassing some maybe more helpful
27:14
cognitive processes of learning that they were doing when they were writing their notes, their actual retention and
27:20
their depth may go down. So yes, they have saved time, but they could also
27:25
save time by just not studying and that would have the exact same effect of reducing the metrics that actually
27:32
matter. And so I think this is a good example because the easy thing to measure in this case hours a day is not
27:39
always the metric that actually matters. Measuring your retention and measuring your depth and expertise this this is
27:46
much harder. It takes a lot more conscious effort. These are not metrics that are like readily available for you.
27:52
But by not having these metrics that actually matter, you run the risk of
27:57
being this person or this person. If you pick a metric that is actually wrong,
28:04
where tracking that metric is going to make you change things in a way that's worse, you're going to become like this
28:10
bottom person marginally getting worse. Whereas, if you're tracking metrics that are essentially meaningless, then you're
28:15
going to be making futile optimizations that actually don't get you any closer to your goal. And so if you want to make
28:21
those 1% changes compound into real gains, a lot of the time you have to
28:26
spend extra effort to find ways to measure the thing that actually matters
28:32
because especially for big complex long-term goals, the metrics are not
28:38
readily available and easy to get your hands on. So one of my students is a emergency doctor training to be a
28:45
medicine specialist and a lot of the learning that she's doing and little optimizations is to try to make her
28:50
better as an emergency medicine specialist but it's very hard for her to track whether her knowledge is
28:55
developing in line with an expert. We tried using chatbt getting it to give
29:01
feedback on her level of knowledge but we found that compared to a true expert it just wasn't nuanced enough. That's a
29:07
common current limitation with a lot of LLM engines. And so the extra effort she
29:13
had to go to was to reach out to her seniors to create a mentorship network
29:18
so that she could have meetings, go through problems and questions, talk about her understanding and get feedback
29:25
to see and calibrate whether she was moving in the right direction or not. This is a very manual process. It takes
29:31
time. It takes effort. Takes other people's time and effort. But it's necessary and incredibly valuable
29:37
because it provides a rare data point about whether you're optimizing in the right direction or not. And the person
29:42
who is dangerously productive, they've probably gone through this process already. They have insights about their
29:49
own processes and systems. They've spent the time to ask themselves, hey, does this really matter? Does this really get
29:55
me to my goal or not? they spent the extra time and effort to evaluate that and critically dissect what they are
30:02
measuring to make sure that they are optimizing in a way that gets them to their goal. And so to help you with
30:07
this, I'm going to give you two different ways that you can start measuring what matters. There are two
30:13
different types of metrics that you should try to set up. The first is an outcome
30:19
metric and the second is a performance or sometimes I like to call it a proxy
30:26
metric. An outcome metric is when you get data on whether you're actually achieving your goal or not. So for
30:32
example, if it's with learning, your goal is to achieve a certain level of retention and depth. So it would be
30:40
about methods that give you data on your retention and your depth. So this could be something like just testing yourself,
30:48
creating a test for yourself, using AI to generate a test for yourself. If the thing you're trying to optimize is your business revenue, that will be the
30:54
actual amount of money that you generated. So you would track that by well just tracking your actual money. If
31:00
it's a fitness goal like running that you're tracking, it's going to be your actual target running pace, right? So
31:08
you're going to actually track the pace of your running. So the outcome metrics
31:13
give you the answer. It tells you, have you achieved it or not? And if you haven't achieved it, what is the actual
31:20
number, the level that you have achieved? So the outcome metric is the most accurate. It's the one that is most
31:26
closely going to reflect your progress to the overall goal. And if you can
31:31
readily generate outcome metrics for yourself, that's kind of the the best. You should do that as much as possible.
31:37
But often outcome metrics are delayed or it's more subtle and ambiguous. It's hard to actually directly measure it. So
31:44
let's say that you are trying to get a job and you need to pass a certain interview. It's really hard to create an
31:50
outcome metric for whether you're passing or failing an interview because there are no real quantifiable metrics
31:56
that you can measure that on and you can't just wait until you do the interview and then fail to realize that
32:01
it wasn't good enough. So when the outcome metric is delayed or it's too hard to get visibility on it, then you
32:08
would try to use a performance or a proxy metric instead. A performance metric or a proxy metric tells you how
32:15
you are doing on the way to your outcome metric. It gives you a sort of checkpoint evaluation and these are
32:22
usually things that are more easy to evaluate and track. So for example uh if
32:28
you are doing that interview you might set up some kind of external you know
32:33
mentor or senior that you can talk to to get feedback. If you're selling a product that hasn't launched yet then
32:40
you might not be able to track the sales number which is what you care about as an outcome metric. So instead maybe you track the number of people that are
32:46
registering to be interested in purchasing this or maybe you track your website views. And the good thing about
32:52
a performance or proxy metric is that because they're just signals of progress, you can really measure
32:59
anything. So let's say that the goal that you want to have is like more emotional stability. So that's very hard
33:07
to measure as an outcome metric, but you can do a daily mood checkin. So you
33:12
could have a daily mood. You could do emotional reflections
33:18
and you can use this data to see whether you're heading in the right direction or not. So you might find that for your
33:24
goal there are one or two outcome metrics that you can measure and then there are four or five proxy metrics
33:30
where no single one of them is going to be enough to give you a picture. But by tracking all five of them, it gives you
33:36
a pretty good idea about whether you're in the right direction. And the most important thing is that you are measuring the thing that actually
33:41
matters instead of just measuring the thing that's easy to track when that may
33:46
not really be correlated to the true outcome you're aiming for. And so that's the third principle, the marginal gains
33:53
fallacy, or rather how to avoid the marginal gains fallacy. And so all of these three things come together in
33:58
understanding that when it comes to productivity, sometimes less is more. And the way you decide what to spend
34:04
your time doing is by avoiding this obvious target trap and doing really
34:09
clear, sometimes emotionally difficult prioritization. And to make sure that the things that you are prioritizing are
34:16
the things that get you to your goal, you need to set up these metrics to measure what matters. And so by
34:21
following these three principles, not only will your productivity improve, but it will become easier and less stressful, and you'll be able to make
34:27
more consistent strides towards your goal when other people may just be busy.
34:33
That is what makes you dangerously productive. Now, if you're interested in more productivity tips like this, then
