Neurodivergent Support
0:00
- Hi, I am Matt Lerner.
0:01
I am an associate professor and program area leader
0:03
at the AJ Drexel Autism Institute.
0:05
I'm here today to answer your questions from the internet.
0:07
This is "Neurodivergent Support."
0:09
[upbeat music]
0:13
alaafia_oluwa asks, "What exactly does it mean
What exactly does it mean to be neurodivergent?
0:16
to be neurodivergent?"
0:18
Great question, Alaafia.
0:19
Neurodivergent is not a diagnosis,
0:22
It doesn't exist in the DSM, Diagnostic Statistical Manual.
0:26
It is a description
0:27
that has sort of emerged from the community.
0:29
It's really meant to describe the whole set of differences
0:34
of ways of either perceiving the world,
0:37
interacting in the world,
0:38
ways of being in the world,
0:40
and really ways brains working, right,
0:42
that's the neuro part,
0:43
that is kind of different from the norm
0:47
in a way that might make it more difficult
0:50
to kind of click in and feel connected,
0:53
and kind of at pace with the rest of the social world.
0:57
Nem_Jem asks, "Do you see the words physically jumping
What dyslexia is actually like
1:01
around the page and moving
1:02
or just in the wrong location?"
1:04
So this is the question about dyslexia.
1:05
So I'd like to give you an illustration
1:07
of kind of what that looks like.
1:08
Up here, you probably see the words the way
1:12
that you typically see them on a page.
1:15
They're standing still.
1:16
They're in the place
1:17
that you expect them to be.
1:18
They stay there.
1:19
And you kind of read them in order.
1:21
Down here, you see the way that many, not all,
1:24
but many dyslexic people view these words.
1:27
So you can see they, you know, might be
1:28
a little bit jumbled around.
1:29
Maybe the order is flipped or switched,
1:31
but they're kind of not staying put
1:33
and doing the things in the order that you need to be able
1:36
to read them fluently and fluidly.
1:38
And so folks with dyslexia are often doing this extra
1:42
cognitive effort of trying to figure out,
1:44
not just what does this say,
1:45
but when I look at it,
1:47
what do I think it's sort of meant to say?
1:50
And how do I get the letters
1:52
to look the way they're supposed to look so that it does?
1:55
TheAspieWorld asks, "Autism social masking:
Autism social masking
1:59
what is it and why do we do it?"
2:01
There's this term called masking or camouflaging.
2:05
Sometimes it's called PAN, or passing as non-autistic.
2:08
Essentially these are all different terms
2:10
for when autistic people are either working hard
2:15
to present as not autistic,
2:17
or to kind of minimize their autism features,
2:20
or when autistic people are doing that,
2:23
whether or not they're doing it intentionally,
2:25
maybe because that's just kind of how they've learned
2:27
or where they've learned.
2:28
What it is, still, there's a lot of research into it,
2:31
but it's generally this idea of sort of effortfully trying
2:35
to impede doing things that autistic people do to fit in.
2:40
So many autistic people like to use, you know,
2:45
fidgets and things like this, right?
2:47
And, you know, maybe they'll not have a fidget nearby.
2:50
Or many autistic people might have a particular topic
2:53
or thing that they like to talk about socially
2:56
or like to talk about is their interest.
2:59
Maybe they won't do that in certain contexts.
3:02
Many autistic people, for instance, say that eye contact,
3:05
the thing I'm doing with you right now into this camera,
3:08
is uncomfortable, or it's hard to do,
3:10
but many autistic people who are masking or camouflaging
3:13
might force themselves to do that,
3:15
even if it's uncomfortable.
3:17
All of those are efforts
3:18
to try to sort of fit into this neurotypical world.
3:22
Some emerging research suggests that that is really,
3:24
that can be taxing,
3:25
that it's sort of using up a lot of cognitive resources,
3:29
brain resources, effort, emotional resources
3:32
to try to do that to fit in.
3:34
But one thing we hear a lot from the autism community
3:36
is that over time it can be taxing.
3:39
There's some evidence, some emerging evidence
3:41
that it can be related to things
3:42
like anxiety and depression,
3:44
because if you're working that hard,
3:46
you're sort of spending yourself out.
3:48
So finding ways to help autistic people
3:51
not have to mask quite so much
3:53
so that they can be their authentic selves
3:56
seems like an important goal.
3:57
TeslaCox asks, "How do I tell my real doctor
What is a “real” doctor anyway
4:01
that I've been diagnosed neurodivergent
4:03
with ADHD from TikTok doctors?"
4:06
Okay, let's break this one down a little bit.
4:08
You can't be diagnosed neurodivergent.
4:10
Like we said, it's not a formal diagnosis.
4:13
Number two, I'm not sure what a TikTok doctor is per se.
4:18
The important thing here though,
4:20
that TeslaCox is getting at is, you know,
4:23
there is a wealth of information now,
4:27
deluge of information online about neurodivergence,
4:31
about different ways of being,
4:32
people sharing their own experiences,
4:34
sometimes people who are clinicians
4:36
providing their own insights online on the internet,
4:38
and it's great to have access
4:39
to the end of that information.
4:41
The key thing to understand, though,
4:42
is that that information is not always accurate
4:46
in reference to our actual diagnostic categories
4:49
that you could get from a doctor
4:50
and get covered by your insurance or anything.
4:52
In fact, some studies have suggested,
4:55
studies of both presentations of autism on TikTok,
4:59
presentations of ADHD on TikTok,
5:00
have shown that well over 50% of the features
5:04
said to be associated with ADHD or autism in TikTok
5:09
aren't part of the diagnostic category.
5:11
So what does this mean?
5:12
What do you do?
5:13
Number one probably wouldn't go to your real doctor
5:16
and say, TikTok told me I have this.
5:18
But what you might do is say, gosh, I was, you know,
5:21
watching these videos on TikTok,
5:23
and it kind of struck a chord with me,
5:24
and it made me wanna know more.
5:26
And I think that's what this stuff can be good for.
5:28
It can help you to open the door to say, gosh,
5:32
if there are things that have been harder
5:33
for me than I thought, or things that were hard for me,
5:36
but it never occurred to me that it wasn't hard
5:39
for everybody, what do I do with that?
5:41
That's a really good thing to take to a doctor
5:44
to get their feedback.
5:46
Serious_Toe9303 asks,
Love On The Spectrum
5:48
"Is 'Love on the Spectrum' a good representation
5:50
of autism and are there better ones?"
5:52
That's a great question.
5:53
Love on the spectrum is one of a small
5:55
but growing number of shows
5:56
that has actually autistic people being portrayed.
5:59
Some aspects of the portrayal
6:01
and those relationships are kind of made for TV,
6:04
like a lot of reality TV.
6:08
But I think what's really valuable about it
6:10
is that it's taking seriously the fact
6:13
that the best way to know autistic people
6:15
or any neurodivergent person
6:17
is to actually get to know them,
6:19
and see them, and see how that community presents itself.
6:22
So if the question is, are there better ones,
6:24
I think the best representations
6:26
are by autistic people representing themselves
6:30
and their own experiences,
6:31
either autistic actors acting
6:34
or autistic people living
6:36
and sharing their own experience
6:38
so that we are not caricaturing,
6:40
but truly trying to appreciate all of the different ways
6:44
that autistic and other neurodivergent people
6:46
live and experience their world.
6:48
CobainyWhitte1 asks, "What are signs of autism?"
Signs of autism
6:51
The features of autism fit into two general categories,
6:55
social communication and restricted and repetitive behaviors
6:58
and kind of sensory stuff?"
6:59
So social and communication
7:01
might be kind of really straightforward difficulties
7:04
with communication, language development,
7:07
kind of speaking and communicating in kind of the ways
7:11
that are expected for a person's development,
7:13
as well as more complex and subtle social challenges,
7:16
like coordinating and social interaction,
7:18
friendship making and connection, eye contact,
7:21
nonverbal cues, picking up social nuance,
7:24
all features like that.
7:25
That's the social communication side.
7:27
In the other side,
7:28
the kind of restricted repetitive behavior side,
7:29
you might have somebody
7:30
who has like a really restricted interest or focus.
7:33
It could be like a topic that they're really interested in
7:35
or it could be, you know,
7:36
a child who runs a car back and forth over and over again
7:39
on the table or on their hand.
7:40
You also might have repetition of, you know,
7:44
certain words or phrases over and over again.
7:47
There's this concept called echolalia
7:48
where somebody kind of hears something
7:50
and then kind of keeps echoing it back
7:51
over, and over, and over.
7:53
And this also kinda loads on
7:55
with these sensory features of autism.
7:57
Some folks on the spectrum again
8:00
can be very sensitive to touch, or smell,
8:04
or taste, or sounds, or lights,
8:06
and that those kind of sensitivities
8:08
can make it very difficult to be in those environments.
8:11
People might, you know, cover their ears
8:13
and need earplugs to be able to manage certain settings.
8:15
Lights like, like the ones in the room that I'm in right now
8:18
might feel very bright and overwhelming.
8:20
They also might engage in something called stimming,
8:22
which is a way in which, you know,
8:23
folks on the spectrum might use something like this
8:26
and kind of, you know, over and over again
8:27
kinda move it around as a way
8:29
to kind of feel good.
8:31
But really, it's a way to kind of regulate
8:32
and manage that sensory experience.
8:34
Folks on the spectrum have lots of different kinds of stims.
8:37
They might hum, auditory stims.
8:39
They might have visual stems,
8:41
like looking at their hands and finger flicking
8:43
outta the corner of their eye.
8:44
And some folks have larger stims, like rocking
8:46
or even hand flapping or pacing back and forth.
8:48
ZoeBlade asks, "What is and isn't stimming?"
What is and isn’t stimming?
8:52
So stimming is a term in the autism world, autism field,
8:57
sort of a colloquial term for self stimulatory behavior.
9:02
You know, kind of traditional sort of ideas of stimming
9:05
might be things like rocking, flapping.
9:08
There's this finger flicking thing
9:10
that many autistic kids do,
9:12
but it might also involve taking a toy
9:15
and kind of, you know, playing with it
9:18
like this over and over again.
9:19
And some people do auditory stimming,
9:21
like humming or maybe saying a word over and over again.
9:25
So again, there can be visual.
9:26
There can be tactile.
9:28
There can be auditory.
9:29
The best evidence about stimming
9:31
is that it is a tool that autistic people are using
9:35
to kind of regulate their sensory system,
9:39
which can often get a little bit overwhelmed
9:42
and kind of putting that energy somewhere.
9:45
JaiCartier3 asks, "Is autism really on the rise?
Autism: On the rise or just better diagnosed?
9:49
Are we just better at identifying it these days?"
9:52
When we think about the rise in autism,
9:54
we think about four sets of factors that could be happening.
9:57
Number one, change in diagnostic criteria.
10:02
So when you look at the the DSM,
10:05
or the diagnostic Bible, you know,
10:07
back in the 1980s or even earlier,
10:09
there were fewer ways to have autism
10:12
and they generally required
10:14
much more significant challenges to be on board.
10:17
You know, somebody who is developing language
10:20
at a sort of usual rate,
10:23
and is integrated into school
10:25
would have a lot of trouble
10:27
even getting an autism diagnosis.
10:29
Those folks were there,
10:30
but they weren't getting autism diagnoses
10:32
back in the '80s, '70s, earlier.
10:34
It really wasn't until the DSM-IV in the mid '90s
10:39
that we even had these sort of broader criteria,
10:41
broader ways of having an autism diagnosis.
10:43
And so that change alone has dramatically expanded
10:48
the ways to even be diagnosed as autistic.
10:51
So that's contributed a huge amount to the rise.
10:54
The second is a broader awareness.
10:58
And these things go hand in hand.
11:00
And so yeah, somebody who's going to their, you know,
11:02
doctor somewhere in the middle
11:03
of like a rural county in the middle of the country,
11:06
that doctor, you know, 20, 30 years ago
11:08
may have never seen an autistic person
11:10
and may have never even thought to look for autism.
11:13
But now we know more about autism,
11:16
there are more representations in the media,
11:18
there's much broader awareness,
11:21
and once folks start to see somebody who's autistic
11:24
in their practice or in their world,
11:26
they go, "Oh yeah, I can kind of notice that."
11:28
The third thing has to do with changes in stigma
11:32
and how autism is viewed.
11:33
So because of the first two things, all of a sudden,
11:36
you know, the ideas, it used to be that, you know,
11:38
getting diagnosed with autism was quite scary for families.
11:42
For some it might still be,
11:43
but much more commonly the idea was what is that,
11:46
and what's gonna happen to my child?
11:48
The last thing,
11:49
the fourth is a true rise in autism,
11:53
even after correcting for population growth
11:56
and understanding that the populations grow over time.
11:58
The best we can tell
11:59
from really good epidemiological research
12:02
over many, many years looking at millions of people
12:04
is that the vast majority
12:06
of the rise in autism is attributed
12:09
to the first three things.
12:10
That is most of why autism is on the rise.
12:14
QuinnTheCats asks,
12:15
"This is about to sound like the dumbest question ever,
12:17
but what exactly is ADHD?"
What exactly is ADHD?
12:19
It's not a dumb question, QuinnTheCats.
12:21
There are kind of three types of ADHD,
12:24
and they kind of each answer the question.
12:26
One is ADHD, inattentive type,
12:29
so meaning folks with ADHD inattentive type
12:32
struggle to pay attention, maintain attention.
12:36
They might seem to sort of, you know,
12:38
wander off or have trouble kind of staying engaged
12:42
in a conversation or on a topic.
12:44
They might struggle academically as a result of this.
12:46
Then, there's what's called ADHD hyperactive type.
12:50
And these are kids who kind of move all around the place,
12:55
have trouble controlling their bodies,
12:57
have trouble sitting still.
12:58
There's a item on kind of the ADHD questionnaire
13:01
that says, "Acts as if driven by a motor."
13:03
And I feel like this is the one when I talk
13:04
to parents often, they're like, "Yeah, that one.
13:06
He acts like he's driven by a motor,
13:08
and the motor doesn't stop."
13:10
And then there is ADHD-C, which is the most common,
13:13
which is the combined type,
13:15
which is basically the inattentive stuff
13:17
and the hyperactive stuff all mushed together.
13:20
A redditer asks, "What did people with autism
What did people with autism do in the past?
13:23
do in the past?"
13:24
So the answer is that people with autism in the past
13:27
did the same things other people did.
13:29
They existed out in the world.
13:32
There's a book called "Autism in History"
13:35
that profiles a lord, kind of sub-lord from the countryside
13:40
that makes the case
13:40
that this particular person was autistic.
13:43
The idea is that he happened to be in an environment
13:47
where his quirky way of being was notable.
13:50
He showed up, a lot of the stuff comes from court documents,
13:53
but he had kind of all these supports,
13:56
and resources, and things around him,
13:57
and he kind of went about his life
13:59
in his kind of very unique and particular way.
14:01
So in that book, the court documents describe him
14:04
as having odd sorts of movements.
14:05
They would say he would sort of ramble on in ways
14:07
that they considered to be, you know, incoherent,
14:10
but they said not unintelligible,
14:12
that, you know, they sort of were streams
14:14
of meaningful words and sentences,
14:16
but that they didn't really have a way to contextualize
14:19
what he was saying and meaning,
14:20
sort of in the same way
14:21
that somebody on the spectrum might, you know,
14:23
have a real strong, what we call perseverative interest,
14:25
like a fixation, just sort of talk about that
14:27
without necessarily checking
14:29
that the other person is following along
Tourettes onset
14:30
with what they're saying.
14:31
DescriptionMean9351 asks,
14:35
"People keep saying
14:35
that I can't have Tourettes because I developed it at two.
14:38
People say you have to be born with it."
14:40
You can develop ticks later on.
14:43
And there are lots of different reasons
14:44
and ways that ticks can kind of onset later.
14:47
But yes, a person can start to develop ticks at two
14:51
or even later than that.
14:52
iscreweduprealbad asks, "My ticks feel half voluntary?"
Tics
14:57
Question mark.
14:58
So this is about Tourettes and other tick conditions.
15:00
So ticks are kind of an interesting phenomenon.
15:04
One way that people think about ticks
15:06
is there's this sort of like surge of a feeling,
15:09
a need to do a thing, and that that surge
15:11
is like a wave that's cresting over a person,
15:15
and kind of can't be stopped.
15:17
The kind of historical way of thinking about it
15:19
that psychologists sometimes say is that it's easier
15:22
to stop a tick once it starts
15:23
than to stop a tick from starting.
15:26
So half voluntary.
15:28
The idea is that the sort of surge of the wave,
15:32
that kind of compulsion that comes from the tick is
15:35
might be able to be kind of diverted, right?
15:37
Maybe the idea is that, you know,
15:39
if a person can feel it coming on,
15:41
they might be able to say,
15:41
all right, I'm gonna, you know, do this motion
15:44
but not that,
15:45
or I'm going to do my best to kind of hold it back.
15:47
So there's almost like this...
15:48
It's like you can put a canal along the wave
15:52
that you can kind of pick something about it,
15:53
even if you can't pick it.
15:54
PaperJoshi asks,
ADHD and hyper focus
15:56
"I never understood
15:57
how hyperfocus is a symptom of ADHD."
16:00
It's a really good question.
16:01
So ADHD broadly has to do
16:03
with, you know, sort of difficulties sustaining attention,
16:07
kind of hyperactivity, maybe working memory problems.
16:10
So how is it the case that folks
16:13
with ADHD can hyperfocus if their problem is focus?
16:17
Well, one way to think about it is ADHD
16:20
can almost be seen as difficulty
16:23
with the sort of lever that regulates your focus.
16:27
Often what we have to do throughout our day
16:30
is take our focus and kind of pivot it somewhere else
16:33
and say, I'm focusing over here, I'm focusing over here.
16:36
I have to give you my attention now,
16:38
and I have to keep doing it
16:39
for as long as you need me to pay attention to you.
16:41
That is what our brains are doing.
16:43
Folks with ADHD might struggle to kind of do that shifting
16:49
at the rate and the way that people want.
16:50
So they might kind of get stuck in, like,
16:52
I can't really hold my focus here
16:54
so I'm gonna kind of keep bouncing around.
16:56
But they also, when they do find something
16:58
that is motivating, that is engaging,
17:01
that they're interested in,
17:02
it's sort of like then they're locked into that,
17:04
and can't quite yank that lever off of that topic.
17:07
A redditer asks,
17:08
"Does reading improve with practice for dyslexics?"
Does reading improve with practice for dyslexics?
17:11
The thing for dyslexic people
17:14
is that the strategies
17:17
that they need to use to get the words
17:19
to behave the way that they need them to be able to read
17:22
are learnable, are teachable.
17:23
They can take effort,
17:24
but then that effort, like a muscle,
17:26
can get flexed and built over time.
17:28
And so in a similar way as that, right,
17:31
folks, if they are practicing using those skills
17:33
and strategies effectively,
17:36
things can get a little bit easier,
17:38
but fundamentally they're still managing
17:41
kind of a different way of perceiving
17:43
that information to make it work for them.
17:45
Qgirl50 asks, "Is autism genetic?
Is there an autism gene?
17:48
Have they identified a gene?"
17:50
A lot of very smart autism researchers
17:53
over the last 20 years
17:54
have done the kind of work that you do in a Petri dish
17:56
with a DNA sequence.
17:57
They've done the kind of work
17:58
where you look at really gigantic populations of people
18:01
and look at kind of genetic markers.
18:03
And what they found is actually
18:04
more, and more, and more specific genes,
18:07
areas on the human genome,
18:09
that seem to be related to autism
18:11
that have again this idea of sort
18:13
of like an autism load to them.
18:14
And there's certain ones where they call them loci,
18:18
sort of areas on the gene of the DNA strand
18:23
that if there's a little bit of a difference,
18:25
maybe you can might see a little bit of autism features.
18:28
Sometimes if there's a lot of a difference,
18:30
you might see more features.
18:32
So all together, what this suggests to us
18:34
is a lot, actually well over 50,
18:38
some estimate at least 70% or more
18:41
of variation amount of autism that's sort of out there
18:44
in the world is attributable to to genetic factors.
18:48
TitanicMan asks, "Is there a reason
Why is profanity a Tourette’s tic?
18:50
why some people with Tourettes
18:51
have swear words specifically as their tick?
18:54
Of all the words that could be their tick,
18:55
why is it almost always profanity?"
18:57
So this is partially myth
19:01
and misunderstanding and partially not.
19:02
So it turns out a lot of ticks are not profanity.
19:07
Many folks with Tourettes have much subtler presentations.
19:11
You know, they might be really small ticks,
19:12
little motor tick, you know, a slight smirk,
19:14
or a twitch of the eye or, you know,
19:16
kind of a little head tick that can happen,
19:20
and those are actually much, much more common.
19:22
They're not as attention grabbing,
19:24
and so people don't necessarily notice them,
19:26
and call attention to them quite as much.
19:28
And so yeah, it's not the case that most people
19:31
with Tourettes for instance,
19:33
have swear words as their ticks.
19:34
It is the case though that there are a subset of folks
19:38
where their ticks are profanity.
19:40
It's a little bit complicated as to why,
19:42
and there's a lot of interesting research
19:44
kind of trying to understand this question.
19:46
The best that I understand is that
19:48
to some extent ticks do have to do with
19:51
this kind of motivation
19:52
and self-regulatory system, right?
19:54
There's this sort of urge, sort of surge,
19:56
like you said before,
19:58
and then this kind of, you know, pullback.
20:00
And the thing is, there are lots of things that we try
20:03
to self-regulate about during the day, right?
20:06
We try not to have road rage.
20:09
We try not to steal our siblings candy
20:12
when it's sitting next to them.
20:14
And we try not to swear.
20:16
There's, you know, some evidence that suggests that,
20:18
you know, that process might be getting wrapped up
20:21
for those folks,
20:22
that there's this sort of self-regulatory thing,
20:24
I'm not gonna do it,
20:26
and the brain is kind of like,
20:27
alright, I'm gonna push through the thing
20:29
I really don't wanna do right now,
20:32
I'm not meant to do right now.
20:32
And it becomes that thing,
20:34
and then it gets stuck.
20:35
That's one of the, I think, more intriguing ideas
20:38
as to why when it's profanity, why it's that.
20:43
estellalikessalt says,
20:45
"Genuine question.
Medication
20:46
If ADHD is viewed as a problem
20:49
to where medication is taken for it,
20:52
why is it not the same with autism?
20:55
This is a genuine curiosity.
20:57
I'm not saying that either should be medicated.
20:59
Please don't take this,
21:00
as I'm saying autism should be medicated."
21:02
Appreciate the sensitivity Estella.
21:04
The answer actually is that has less to do with the idea
21:07
that the medical field thinks
21:09
that one should and the other shouldn't.
21:10
It actually has to do with the available
21:12
medications that exist.
21:14
ADHD since the '80s has stimulant medications,
21:18
and then now other types of medications that help
21:20
to manage attention, and focus, and self-regulation.
21:24
For autism the sort of quest
21:27
for medication has even, you know,
21:30
assuming that you sort of believe
21:32
in medication as being important,
21:34
which, you know, many do,
21:35
has been a lot more fraught.
21:36
As I've described,
21:37
autism has these sort of two core areas, right?
21:41
Social communication, restrictive repetitive behavior,
21:43
and we've really, we haven't found many things
21:46
that can really on their own help
21:49
with the social communication piece.
21:51
Social stuff is a lot more complicated
21:53
than regulating attention.
21:55
Same thing for restricted repetitive behaviors.
21:57
There's sort of some evidence of some things
22:00
that can help a little bit if folks
22:01
are like really, really struggling a lot with those things.
22:05
But for the most part that's a lot more difficult too.
22:09
There are a couple of medications that are FDA approved
22:12
to address things like significant aggression
22:16
in folks on the spectrum,
22:18
but that's really only for the subset
22:20
of people who are experiencing those challenges.
22:21
And importantly, you might notice
22:23
that's not a core part of autism.
22:25
A Reddit user asks,
22:26
"Is there a way to treat ADHD without meds?"
22:28
Great question.
22:29
So yes, there are behavioral
22:31
and psychological treatments for ADHD
22:33
and within, you know, kids and adults.
22:35
In childhood, there are a number
22:40
of kind of what are called like behavioral parent training
22:43
or, you know, parent management type approaches,
22:45
which involve helping to kind of boost
22:49
what's called, like, the salience
22:51
or the ways in which, you know,
22:52
things that kids with ADHD might miss
22:53
that they kind of need to do.
22:55
Helps them kind of attend to it
22:56
by giving them lots and lots of reward,
22:58
and support, and attention for kind of getting it, right?
23:01
'Cause many ADHD kids, they kind of might know what to do
23:04
or have a sense of what to do
23:05
but they kind of miss it in the moment
23:07
or they can't figure out how to translate
23:09
that knowing into doing.
23:10
basbillions asks, "What does 'on the spectrum' mean?"
On the spectrum
23:15
Autism is also called autism spectrum disorder in the DSM.
23:20
Even though lots of different things
23:22
are spectra, spectrums, lots of different conditions,
23:26
autism has sort of come to be referred to
23:28
as sort of the spectrum.
23:30
And what's really interesting
23:32
is that autism has undergone an incredible evolution
23:36
over the last several decades.
23:38
As recently as the '70s or '80s,
23:41
people thought of autism
23:42
as the most categorical thing.
23:45
You could go to, you know, psychiatry conferences
23:48
and famous psychiatrists would say things like,
23:51
well, if there's anything that can be diagnosed
23:53
in a waiting room by watching a child for a few minutes,
23:56
surely it's autism.
23:57
Because the idea is that autism
23:58
was seen as so different, so categorical,
24:01
that you could kind of just spot autism
24:03
when you see it.
24:04
And now it's swung all the way the other way
24:07
from really seeing this so dramatically different
24:11
that you could just sort of spot autism anywhere
24:12
to being the spectrum, the spectrum,
24:15
the thing that is not about categorical difference at all.
24:19
And I think this tells us a lot
24:20
about our evolving understanding of autism,
24:22
but also our evolving understanding
24:24
of the individual differences between people.
24:26
A Reddit user asks, "How does the brain structure
24:29
of autistic people differ?"
24:31
Lots of really interesting research has gone into this.
24:35
Well, I think one of the big things
24:37
I would say we do know more and more about these days
24:40
is the idea of kind
24:41
of the connections of autism.
24:43
There's this fancy term, a connectopathy.
24:46
It's a $10 million word there,
24:48
but the idea that autism can be defined
24:50
by a difference in the way the brain
24:52
interconnects with itself.
24:54
And while this is still evolving, broadly speaking,
24:56
there's this idea that autism
24:59
has a lot more connections.
25:02
Autistic brains have a lot more connections kind of locally,
25:05
kind of close by, little short distance neuron connections,
25:09
but that globally, kind of long distance connections
25:12
across different regions of the brain,
25:14
there seem to be fewer of them.
25:16
And, actually even some thought that this might help
25:18
to explain some, some parts
25:21
of what we understand about autism.
25:23
'Cause maybe those short distance connections, you know,
25:25
they might be telling us something
25:27
about some of the difficulties in sensory processing.
25:30
It might be like, you know,
25:31
if you've got all these short distance connections going,
25:33
fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, it might be harder, you know,
25:35
if things are really loud
25:37
or things are really bright to manage that.
25:39
But then, those longer distance connections,
25:41
which are used maybe
25:42
for a more broader processing, or development, or learning,
25:45
those, if they're sparser, might take longer.
25:48
It might be more difficult for those connections
25:50
to kind of grow and learn.
25:53
ArktokosO2 says,
25:54
"What age do you think it would be appropriate
Autism diagnosis age
25:56
to diagnose someone with autism?
25:59
So one thing we do know is that autism
26:02
is by and large with you at birth.
26:05
So by the time somebody is born,
26:07
their brain is sort of wired up in that direction,
26:11
if they are autistic.
26:12
Those developmental trajectories
26:14
can change one way or another
26:16
in a variety of different ways.
26:17
But that's by and large what we know.
26:18
So one of the goals actually is to get diagnosis,
26:21
as early as possible
26:22
so that there can be support
26:24
as early as possible.
26:25
Early intervention and other kinds of supports
26:28
which you can get in, you know,
26:28
every state in America,
26:29
we wanna make sure that those things are available
26:31
so that folks have the best opportunity.
26:33
For years it was thought that three
26:36
might be kind of on the earliest side, you know.
26:39
Then, we sort of push to two,
26:41
and I would say, you know, clinically it's now possible
26:44
using some of our best diagnostic tools
26:46
to diagnose toddlers even down to like 18 months,
26:50
some even down to 12 months using our clinical tools.
26:53
But increasingly, diagnostic science
26:55
and autism has really been picking up
26:58
and there are are now some cutting edge studies
27:01
using tools like some kinds of brain imaging
27:03
and eye tracking that are promising for diagnosing autism
27:06
as young as six months and maybe even younger.
27:09
So let's see where that goes.
27:11
Judicialreview asks, "Does autism correlate with IQ
Autism and IQ
27:17
or does high IQ correlate with autism?"
27:19
Headline here is that autism
27:22
does not really correlate with IQ.
27:25
Autism does not discriminate by race, color,
27:28
IQ, or other features.
27:31
Autism exists everywhere in the world
27:33
across the whole spectrum of being.
27:36
I think that interesting kind of tricky question here
27:38
is that very often because of the different ways of thinking
27:42
and processing that autistic people have,
27:44
performance of autistic people on IQ tests
27:47
can be really different.
27:49
You can have these big splits
27:50
or sort of islands of ability where somebody might seem
27:52
to have really strong verbal ability,
27:55
but then much less strong ability in other areas,
27:58
like processing speed, or self-regulation,
28:01
or visual perception.
28:02
Or it might be the other way.
28:03
They might have great, you know, visual perception
28:05
or processing ability
28:07
and less ability in spoken language.
28:10
PipDBurley asks
28:11
"What myths about autism annoy you?
Autism myths
28:13
What is the reality versus the myth?"
28:15
There are a lot of myths about autism,
28:16
but probably the one
28:18
that is often most frustrating
28:20
is the idea that autistic people lack empathy
28:23
and can't understand the feelings of others.
28:25
This is very common kind of colloquial idea
28:29
that comes out of sort of observing autistic people
28:31
kind of seeming disconnected
28:33
and sort of seeming not to pay attention
28:35
to the needs of other people,
28:36
seeming off to be in their own world, right?
28:37
Autism, literally from the Greek, you know, means self-ism.
28:41
Autos is self.
28:42
And so there's this notion, I think this implicit notion
28:45
that autistic people are self-ish,
28:47
that they're sort of focused on their own needs,
28:49
and can't really feel those of others,
28:51
but actually, one, actually autistic people
28:54
will tell us all the time that that's not true,
28:56
that that's not their experience at all,
28:58
that maybe they might struggle
28:59
to communicate their understanding in the same way,
29:01
but that they can very much
29:03
and increasingly research,
29:05
even on very young and even, you know,
29:07
minimally verbal autistic people,
29:08
shows us that myth really is a myth,
29:10
that autistic children and adults do co-feel.
29:14
They can empathize,
29:15
often sometimes quite profoundly,
29:18
in fact, so much so that they're overwhelmed
29:21
by, you know, the feeling of another person.
29:23
And that itself might interfere
29:24
with the ability to express it.
29:26
That's all the questions for today.
29:27
Hope you learned something.
29:28
Until next time.
29:29
