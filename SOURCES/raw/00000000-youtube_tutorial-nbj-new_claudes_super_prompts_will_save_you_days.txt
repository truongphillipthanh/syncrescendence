Claude's new skills feature is a super prompt—but people are sleeping on it.

The common story is that it’s just another prompt shortcut — but there's SO much more to it and it's NOT just for Claude

In this video, I share the inside scoop on how Claude’s skills system changes the game for LLMs:
• Why “skills” break the tyranny of the prompt and enable composable AI work
• How to build and reuse these Lego-brick capabilities in Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini
• What makes this the first real path toward automating complex, multi-step workflows
• Where the real limits still are — and why clear prompts still matter

For operators and builders, this is a new level of leverage: the start of promptless productivity, not the end of prompting.

Revolutionizing AI Interaction with Claude
0:00
I think that this is one of the biggest
0:01
pieces of news in the entire year.
0:03
Claude launched a way for us to get past
0:06
the tyranny of the prompt and I worked
0:08
out a way to use that same technique
0:11
outside Claude in Chad GPT in Gemini and
0:13
other places. We're going to dive into
0:15
the whole thing, but the first piece I
0:18
want you to realize is that everything
0:20
has been prompt dependent and that has
0:22
made hard work really difficult.
0:24
Basically, if you want to do something
0:25
complicated like a PowerPoint or an
0:27
Excel or a full financial analysis, it's
0:30
possible, but it's really been prompt
0:32
dependent. And anything we can do that
0:34
makes it slightly easier, slightly less
0:37
dependent on the prompt is a really big
0:39
deal because it makes it so much easier
0:41
for so many more people to do that hard
0:44
work. That is what we got today from
0:47
Claude. It's called the skills launch.
0:50
And the idea is that you have these
0:52
composable Lego bricks. They're called
0:54
capabilities in your settings section.
0:56
I'm going to show you here in a second.
0:58
And all you have to do is enable
1:02
capabilities that Claude can call in any
1:05
conversation in any combination. And so
1:09
I'll give you a specific example. One of
1:11
the things that has been difficult for
1:13
people to do with AI has been a
1:15
complicated task like figuring out a job
1:18
search strategy. So let's say you need
1:20
to identify candidate job postings. You
1:23
need to compose a resume that fits those
1:25
job postings. You need to make sure that
1:27
your search strategy actually works for
1:28
those jobs. That your targeting strategy
1:30
works for outreach. This is complicated
1:32
work. Normally it would take a lot of
1:34
prompts. It would take many prompts in a
1:36
row. Some people sign up for tools and
1:38
services for this. What you can do with
1:40
Claude is you can make skills that refer
1:44
to this complicated work and give Claude
1:47
special instructions to do it well. Like
1:48
your job search strategy could instruct
1:51
Claude specifically what sites you
1:52
prefer, what job family and roles you
1:55
prefer, what levels you prefer, what
1:56
compensation you want. And all of that
1:58
would be stored inside this Lego brick
2:01
of context that Claude can go and call.
2:04
Not when you have to tag it. You don't
2:06
have to remember it. You just have to
2:08
say, "Hey, I'm trying to think about
2:10
what job search strategy I should use
2:12
for this week." And then give it some
2:14
context about your last few weeks, your
2:16
learnings. Help me figure it out. Claude
2:18
will look at that initial prompt,
2:20
understand you're talking about job
2:21
search, and go dig up a skill and use it
2:24
on the fly. It's super intuitive. And
2:26
the magical thing is because of the way
2:30
they've simplified the the file
2:32
structure, the Lego brick, it's just a
2:33
markdown file. you can use this other
2:36
places and that's what I figured out. So
Building Skills: The New Era of AI Capabilities
2:38
I'm going to show you that too. You can
2:39
use it in Chad GPT in Gemini. And what
2:42
this does is it makes the whole process
2:45
of doing a difficult complicated
2:48
multi-step piece of work so much easier.
2:50
And so this is not just a story about
2:53
can we make PowerPoints easier, can we
2:55
make Excel easier, can we make job
2:57
search easier. It's a story about can we
3:01
do hard work with much less effort. It's
3:04
like Claude gave us a lever, a 10X lever
3:07
on our prompting. And so without further
3:10
ado, I'm going to jump in. And the first
3:12
thing I'm going to show you is sort of
3:13
the the settings page, how this actually
3:15
looks when you when you sign up for it.
3:17
But we won't spend much time there.
3:19
We're going to spend most of our time
3:20
diving into how you create these because
3:22
the magic of this is that you are not
3:24
locked in to whatever the Anthropic and
3:27
Claude team give you. You can make these
3:29
yourself. And I can make them for you.
3:32
And I have. I'm making them for you.
3:33
It's so exciting because we can
3:35
basically make these big packages that
3:38
help us to effectively do lots and lots
3:42
of complex work. Another example is
3:43
vendor AI vendor risk estimation, AI
3:46
vendor build by solution estimates,
3:48
super complicated work. You can have a
3:50
skill for that now. You don't have to
3:51
write a gigantic prompt in the same way
3:53
you did. You can just say, "Hey, please
3:55
assess this vendor." And it will call
3:58
the skill. It will be so much more
3:59
intuitive. I'm so excited for this. All
4:01
right. So, with that in mind, let's
4:03
check out that Claude capability screen.
4:04
Okay. Here we are. We are looking at the
4:06
skills that are in Claude. Now, this is
4:08
my Claude and I want to show you that
4:11
there are both standard skills and
4:13
custom skills here. Standard skills,
4:15
you're going to see brand guidelines,
4:17
canvas design, MCP builder. These are
4:19
all skills that Claude provides for us
4:22
as a way of getting this whole ecosystem
4:24
started. I created prompting pattern
4:27
library and it says so added by me right
4:29
59 minutes ago. and it says what it is
4:31
and it's basically a file of prompting
4:34
best practices so that if I talk about
4:36
how I want to create a great prompt, it
4:38
will just invoke prompting pattern
4:40
library and make that so much easier.
4:42
This is super easy to enable. All you
4:44
have to do is just enable the skill
4:48
section at the top and then enable these
4:50
toggles piece by piece down here and
4:52
you're done. All right, I want to show
Creating and Utilizing Skills Effectively
4:54
you an actual skill that I'm building.
4:57
So, I said, "Claude, can you help me
4:58
build a skill for strategizing job
5:00
search?" And I want you to note that
5:02
this is not the world's best prompt. And
5:04
I did that on purpose. I wanted to call
5:06
out that it's possible to build a good
5:08
skill and it doesn't have to be perfect.
5:11
The prompt doesn't have to be perfect.
5:12
So, I I just laid out a bunch of things
5:15
that I wanted, guidance on how to
5:16
interview the user, how to target the
5:18
job, etc. And so, Claude then starts to
5:21
think about how to create skills. And it
5:23
turns out that one of the things that
5:24
Enthropic released, which I think is
5:26
really smart, is documentation for
5:28
Claude on creating skills. So Claude
5:30
read the instruction manual for creating
5:32
these this skill and then came back and
5:34
said, "This is really great. I see this.
5:36
I have some questions. Here's some
5:38
questions about how I should analyze the
5:39
company's news strategies that are most
5:41
important, etc." I came back with a
5:44
response. I gave it some examples. I had
5:46
an LLM help me build some of this and
5:48
then said, "Great, excellent details.
5:50
I'm going to start building." And so it
5:51
has now spent the last five or so
5:53
minutes building this skill and it comes
5:56
back with a job search strategist zip
5:58
file. It's a complete skill done. It's
6:01
as easy as that. I can now download this
6:03
zip file and re-upload it to Claude in
6:07
the capabilities section and I will have
6:10
a usable job search strategist skill.
6:12
Now, if I want to make it better, which
6:14
is always one of the things I focus on,
6:16
I always think about how I can evaluate
6:18
this skill through the lens of another
6:20
LLM. And so, I can take this skill over
6:23
to chat GPT and I can say, "Hey, can you
6:26
just crack open this zip file, look
6:27
inside, and can you assess whether or
6:31
not this is high quality and make
6:33
specific recommendations for how to
6:35
improve it?" And then I can pull that
6:36
Chad GPT critique, bring it back into
6:39
Claude, and have Claude further improve
6:41
the skill. So, I'm not just sitting here
6:43
taking what Claude gives me. I'm
6:44
actually trying to use a multi LLM
6:46
strategy to make this skill as useful as
6:48
I possibly can. Now, let's jump over to
6:50
chat GPT and I'll show you how I can use
6:54
a skill that I developed in Claude for
6:56
Claude in Chat GPT. All right, here we
Leveraging Skills Across Multiple Platforms
6:58
are in chat GPT. You see that I've
7:01
uploaded a zip file. This is literally
7:02
the exact same zip file that I would
7:05
upload if I was in CLA. I am uploading
7:08
it per chat because that's how chat GPT
7:10
works. And all I say is, "Using this
7:12
file, can you help me come up with a
7:13
really strong prompt for instructing an
7:14
LLM to build a PowerPoint? You'll need
7:16
to crack open the file to do so." So, it
7:18
opens the file and it immediately comes
7:20
up with a very strong PowerPoint. I
7:22
don't have to give it all of this. It
7:24
reads it in the file. And so, look, I
7:27
love the cloud interface. It's very
7:29
intuitive for it to call in the skills.
7:31
I think that's a lovely touch. But I can
7:33
use the exact same files in a chat, GPT
7:37
chat, and get a great result. I can use
7:40
them in a Gemini chat and get a great
7:41
result. And nobody is talking about
7:43
that. Nobody is saying that really what
7:45
has been invented is a way of working
7:47
with AI that gives you composable Lego
7:49
bricks. I think that's fantastic. And so
7:51
you can just pop this in and all you
7:54
have to do is build the ones you want.
7:55
And I gave you some of those tips on how
7:57
you build them. You literally just say
7:58
what you want and work with Claude to
8:00
build it. And Claude has the skill
8:02
creation. And you could do the same
8:04
thing with chat GPT to be honest. You
8:06
can say, "I want you to create a
8:07
markdown file." The markdown file needs
8:09
to be a complete clear set of
8:11
instructions to help a LLM accomplish a
8:15
very complex task. In addition, please
8:17
create these other file types that help
8:18
the LLM do the task. If it's an analysis
8:21
uh file, you may want to give the LLM
8:24
some specific instructions about how to
8:26
analyze, etc. And then you put it all
8:29
together into a zip file and you're
8:30
done. And you have your skill and you
8:32
can upload that and say, "Hey, refer to
8:34
this skill. This is how I like things
8:36
done." You might be wondering now what
8:38
things should be skills. What things
8:41
should be skills? The answer is quite
8:43
simple. If it is something that you
8:45
would want to onboard someone with,
8:48
let's say you have an employee and you
8:50
want to onboard them and train them,
8:52
super easy. Just give them a skill.
8:55
That's what this is for. That's the
8:56
level we're at. If it's a one-off task,
8:58
if you're not going to repeat it, if
9:00
it's not very high value, don't do a
9:02
skill. It's just too much trouble. But
9:04
if it's something where it's like, "No,
9:05
I'm going to be doing this repeatedly."
9:07
If I had someone doing this for me, I
9:09
would give them some training. I would
9:11
give them some onboarding materials.
9:12
That's when you need the skill. And the
9:15
beauty of the whole ecosystem is that we
9:17
can all just like create the skills and
9:19
trade them around and they'll grow. And
9:21
I think that that is part of what makes
9:23
this so powerful is that it's not locked
9:25
into anthropic. People will come up with
9:28
ways to use these exact files and other
9:30
interfaces. I guarantee that people will
The Importance of Clear Prompting in AI
9:32
come up with ways to use these exact
9:34
same Claude skills folders and files in
9:37
a dozen other tools in the next month
9:39
because they're so powerful. So, I'm
9:40
really excited about this. If you are
9:42
asking me what is the catch, where do I
9:45
need to be careful? I would tell you
9:47
this. We were using the skills before we
9:51
knew they existed. So, when I did my
9:53
video on Excel, when I did my video on
9:55
PowerPoint, Claude was using those
9:58
skills. And what I found in practice
10:00
weeks ago and since as I've been working
10:02
with those tools daily is that even
10:04
though the skills are like a massive 10x
10:08
step up in helping you get stuff done. I
10:10
like watch the video on powerpoints.
10:12
Like it creates incredible powerpoints
10:14
that save days of work. Like it's a it's
10:16
a phenomenal job. You still need to
10:18
prompt well. It does not get you away
10:21
from prompting well when you do serious
10:23
work. Prompting well is like giving this
10:26
massive cool skill package clear
10:29
direction. And so it doesn't have to be
10:30
as long a prompt, but it has to be very
10:33
clear and unambiguous about where you
10:34
want to take all of this power, all of
10:36
this context you've got. So that's if
10:39
you want to catch, that's the catch. You
10:41
still got to be clear in what you're
10:42
asking for, but you don't have to be as
10:45
lengthy as you used to have to be. Like
10:47
if I had to do a complicated piece of
10:48
work like the job search thing, I would
10:50
honestly not even do it in one chat. I
10:52
would just do it in multiple chats,
10:54
right? And you ask for this and then you
10:55
ask for this and then you ask for this,
10:57
like help me with my resume, help me
10:58
with my job search, etc. And you have to
11:00
sort of reinvent the prompt and reinvent
11:02
the context every time. The power of
11:04
this is you can do that much more
11:06
complicated work in a much less heavy
11:09
lift way. That is why I call them super
11:12
prompts because it's like we've taken
11:14
this load that we've all had to carry
11:16
for prompting for so long and it's like
11:18
lifted it. It's like yes, you still have
11:20
to be clear. It's good to be clear about
11:22
what you want. It's good to bring your
11:23
specific context. Bring that specific
11:25
job description, right? Bring the
11:27
specific experience you have that nobody
11:29
else has, right? But you don't have to
11:31
carry as heavy a load on just explaining
11:33
everything in exhaustive detail as you
11:35
used to have to. And that is a huge
The Future of AI Skills and Super Prompting
11:38
breakthrough for all of us. I am so
11:40
excited for that. So, I'm putting
11:41
together a whole set of Claude skills
11:44
that you can use in chat GPT and Gemini.
11:46
You can use them in Claude, of course. I
11:48
can't wait to show them to you. I'll
11:49
have them out with this video on the
11:50
substack. It's going to be great. We are
11:52
just at the beginning of this and I want
11:54
to give you like a great get started
11:55
pack so you're off to the races on using
11:57
cloud skills. Have fun with your new
11:59
super prompting powers.
