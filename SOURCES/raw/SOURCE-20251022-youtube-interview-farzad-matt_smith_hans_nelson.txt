I worked at Tesla starting from 2017 thru 2021. I spent most of my time in the distribution and supply chain organizations in leadership positions.

Before Tesla, I was a Director of Business Intelligence and Pricing at the largest Pet Food & Supply distributor in the US, Phillips Pet Food & Supplies. My wife and I also owned a small business in Bethlehem, PA between 2016 and 2019.

I have been a shareholder of Tesla since 2012 and currently own Tesla stock. Nothing I say constitutes as investment or financial advice.

My thoughts are my own and are not representative of everyone who currently works, or has worked at Tesla, Phillips, or any other company or organization I discuss on this channel.

This is what's great about this call is
0:02
that now we I we can actually start to
0:04
sort of loosely model these things. I
0:06
think we're finally getting some
0:07
guidance where we can sit down and
0:08
model. You know, it was kind it's been
0:10
kind of hazy. It's like we don't really
0:11
know what cyber cap's going to look
0:13
like. We don't really know what bot's
0:14
going to look like, but now we're going
0:15
to we're now we're starting to get more
0:17
and more breadcrumbs with the ability to
0:19
sit down and actually model these
0:20
things. You know, bot 10,000 units by
0:24
the end of 2028. maybe cyber cab or
0:27
cyberc cab like vehicles running that
0:29
line again all unsupervised
0:32
um 3 million by the end of 27 and then
0:36
with the ability to expand to new
0:37
factories thereafter. You could even
0:41
look at 2027 and say if we start the
0:45
production ramp in the end of 2026 for
0:47
cyber cab maybe you're able to deliver
0:50
you know 500 to 750,000 cyber cabs just
0:53
in 27 and then increasing from there
0:57
that's a pretty large number
0:59
significant
1:01
yeah driverless or not or with a
1:04
steering wheel pedal or not right I
1:06
think I think the question becomes like
1:08
Is a car without a steering wheel and
1:10
pedal meaningfully more valuable than
1:12
one with a steering wheel and pedal?
1:14
What do you have you guys thought about
1:15
that at all? It's it it doesn't make it
1:19
I mean if this thing can is robo taxi
1:22
capable
1:24
um then it doesn't matter whether it has
1:27
a steering wheel or a pedal. You know,
1:29
it's probably better that it doesn't for
1:31
obvious reasons. Um but I mean the
1:36
income stream is going to be the same
1:40
and so you can do some very just rough
1:42
basic modeling on that and you know look
1:45
at the like what's the the margin
1:47
potential and you know if it's say
1:50
$15,000
1:52
a vehicle which I think is probably too
1:54
low but just to to be conservative you
1:56
know you could just run that out and so
1:59
you know then you're you're at uh what
2:02
is that 45 billion in cash flow um
2:05
annually at a 3 million unit run rate.
2:08
Um probably higher than that I I would
2:10
think. Um but that's the you know I
2:13
think that's the kind of table stakes
2:16
that they're they're talking about.
2:17
45 billion at 100% margin.
2:20
No, I just assumed 15,000 of of margin.
2:24
And there I think there's different ways
2:26
that this could be structured. So, like
2:27
if you if you like sell it to somebody
2:29
and and maybe they're paying for FSD at
2:32
a price of let's say, you know, $10,000
2:34
and then there's an extra $5,000 of
2:36
margin baked into that, that's 15,000.
2:38
You might maybe you can you can license
2:41
it so there's, you know, a lower upfront
2:43
fee. Um, but like you get a higher chunk
2:46
of the the residual cash flow streams.
2:48
There's there's a lot of different ways
2:49
it can, you know, like actually work.
2:51
Um, but I think just trying to get like
2:53
an idea like what's the general
2:55
magnitude of the opportunity. You can
2:57
just look at like an FSD sales price,
2:59
you know, and multiply that by the
3:00
units. Um, and that's like a reasonable
3:03
estimate of the the cash flow that
3:04
you're going to be generating. And I
3:06
think 15,000 is is probably too low for
3:08
that, you know. Um, maybe but but I
3:10
think it's reasonable if you're assuming
3:11
that you're going to get to millions of
3:13
units. You like the pricing is going to
3:14
have to come down. So, um, that's why,
3:18
you know, I I get reasonably comfortable
3:19
with that kind of number. Yeah, I mean I
3:22
think I I do think long like not even
3:24
long term. I do think the the best
3:25
strategy for Tesla to take here is to
3:27
just do a recurring revenue model. I
3:29
think I think 80% plus of their of these
3:32
unsupervised cars are going to be on a
3:34
monthly payment of sorts. You know, like
3:37
I mean that's where the
3:39
financial incentive to push towards
3:41
cyber caps specifically comes in is that
3:44
you know like you don't sell cyber cabs
3:46
if you're thinking you're going to make
3:47
$15,000 a year on them. Like if they're
3:50
driving around with no humans, you're
3:52
not talking about $15,000 of margin.
3:55
You're talking about hundreds of
3:56
thousands of dollars on margin. And so
3:58
that's I mean this is where I think Elon
4:00
is so autistic about no, you've got to
4:02
make it work without a human. Like you
4:04
don't get the steering wheel and pedals
4:05
because I don't want you to have the
4:06
hedge. You've got to make the hundred
4:09
and some thousand, you know, lifetime
4:11
value vehicle
4:13
work as quickly as possible. And once it
4:16
does, then you know it's a completely
4:18
different profitability profile for the
4:21
entire business model.
4:24
Got it.
4:26
I mean, regardless, it's this is all
4:29
hinged on on supervised getting solved.
4:31
All of this and we're there. That that
4:34
that was my biggest takeaway from the
4:36
call. And this is that was the biggest
4:37
thing I wanted to hear was that uh just
4:41
I I wanted the company to confirm what I
4:42
saw with my own two eyes which is like
4:45
they've solved on but they've solved
4:46
self-driving. Um I think it's it's hard
4:49
to ignore that now and the question
4:53
becomes how much of what has happened on
4:56
the stock market thus thus far maybe
4:57
that's the question is like is that
4:59
priced in now? Is that why we're seeing
5:01
the muted reaction on on Wall Street
5:04
where it's down 3% in after hours or do
5:07
we think that they're waiting for for
5:08
the P&L
5:09
or was because he lied. He said that you
5:13
can go to anyone can go and get FDV14
5:15
right now. That is not true.
5:17
So not true.
5:18
This is a lie.
5:21
Stocks down immediately.
5:22
We can't trust anything he says. No,
5:25
no, it it was actually down after he
5:27
said uh Optimus and maybe that's another
5:29
thing too that we didn't talk about.
5:30
Optimus Optimus is going to be shown in
5:33
Q1
5:34
and I think I think the drop was people
5:35
assume it was going to be shown at the
5:37
investor meeting in a couple weeks. I
5:39
I think that is a big thing and I
5:41
definitely feel vindicated in you know
5:43
he he said we're not even going to lock
5:45
you know design once production starts.
5:47
We're hoping to show you this cool hand
5:49
we've been working on in Q1,
5:52
but they're like until they make the one
5:55
that they're planning to show in Q1,
5:57
they won't even know, okay, like how
5:59
many hundreds of hours does this work
6:02
before it fails. And that's the thing
6:04
where I think this hand is like the the
6:07
number of
6:09
constraining factors that go into this
6:11
are astronomical. like you've got to
6:14
have high reliability, high precision,
6:17
extremely low power, extremely low size
6:20
like volutrically
6:22
and um like basically no heat
6:25
dissipation. Like to accomplish all of
6:29
those things at the same time is
6:32
ridiculous. And then to say, oh yeah,
6:34
and now you want that thing that like
6:36
you've got to have an order of magnitude
6:38
increase in, you know, current
6:40
capabilities of what's out there in
6:42
order to achieve that. We also want to
6:44
make sure that those actuators run for
6:46
thousands and thousands and thousands of
6:48
hours with no failures. It's not going
6:51
to happen and
6:54
like not anytime soon. It's definitely
6:55
like we're not going to have That's why
6:57
your 2028 timeline like I think that's a
7:00
very optimistic timeline to have hands
7:02
that work that well. Um
7:06
we still have to get something out there
7:07
and just start working with it and
7:09
solving the problem. So like eventually
7:11
you'll just go ahead and start shipping
7:13
something and you'll just have to work
7:14
around the fact that these things are
7:16
not where they need to be.
7:17
It's one of the reasons why I'm actually
7:19
like
7:20
Elon's right about how like there's
7:22
reasons you have five fingers. All that
7:24
stuff is correct. Uh, you want it to fit
7:26
in the form factor that we have, but I
7:30
almost think Boston Dynamics like chunky
7:34
three-finger hand is maybe a better
7:36
place to start for now because at least
7:38
you can solve like you can make that do
7:42
useful work. It's not going to be able
7:44
to do all the things that a human can
7:45
do, but that thing is going to be able
7:46
to do useful work reliably for long
7:49
periods of time, a lot sooner than an
7:52
actual, you know, five-finger human hand
7:55
will.
7:57
Well, the the hand approach is very
7:59
reminiscent of like solving for FSD
8:01
using neural
8:02
nets. Yep.
8:04
Right. It's like it's very um it's like
8:07
I don't like the sort of
8:09
let the problem live.
8:10
Yeah. Let the problem live. I don't give
8:11
a [ __ ] solve the hand because the hand
8:13
is going to be the thing that's the
8:15
first principles approach of being able
8:16
to have a human or robot do everything a
8:18
human can
8:20
and it's like don't solve the
8:21
progression solve for the end state.
8:23
Yep. I'll bet you that by the time this
8:26
thing is solved, he tells you, you know,
8:28
he already said the forearm and the hand
8:31
is harder than the whole rest of the
8:32
bot. I'll bet you before we get to the
8:35
end of this, he says just the forearm
8:37
and the hand is 10 times harder than the
8:39
rest of the bot combined. and and that's
8:42
to get the stinking prototype. So this
8:44
is the thing where Elon has told us the
8:46
prototype is easy, production is hard.
8:49
We still don't have a prototype of a
8:52
hand that works. And so like adjust for
8:55
that in your thinking about timelines
8:57
for Optimus.
8:58
Yeah, sorry man. I had to I had to bring
9:00
that up on the screen. Yeah. So um
9:03
within the broader discussion of like
9:05
artificial intelligence, it's becoming
9:08
very obvious Okay. So, so like human or
9:11
robots specifically there there there
9:14
are going to be companies out there that
9:15
are not going to try to take the Tesla
9:17
approach which is like like your Boston
9:19
Dynamics example of like let us take the
9:21
inbetweeners and then those those robots
9:24
will probably gain market share before
9:25
Tesla does because Tesla is trying to go
9:28
for the again the generalized solution
9:30
which is 10 times to 100 times harder
9:33
than what Boston Dynamics is trying to
9:35
solve for. very similarly to what Tesla
9:37
has done with the car trying to solve
9:38
for generalized AI uh a generalized
9:41
self-driving excuse me which is a very
9:44
narrow solution for artificial
9:46
intelligence
9:46
yeah you're going to have uh Whimo Whimo
9:49
humanoids
9:50
[Music]
9:51
and they're going to suffer from the
9:53
same type of issues that Whimo has had
9:55
which is limited scale complexity
9:59
potentially u but they are going to be
10:01
useful in those use cases but the humano
10:04
robot TAM is 10 times to 50 times bigger
10:07
than the driving tam long term.
10:11
I think there's useful work that those
10:13
companies can do that's not as safety
10:15
critical that makes those business model
10:17
like the the challenge for Whimo is that
10:21
they can't operate profitably inside the
10:23
niche that they occupy currently.
10:26
Humanoids can,
10:27
but humanoids probably could. And so
10:29
those can probably be good businesses
10:30
that won't like they won't necessarily
10:31
be as scalable as an Optimus robot, but
10:34
they're not necessarily,
10:36
you know, just money pits.
10:40
So, so fig, so Figure has a pathway.
10:44
Boston Dynamics has a pathway. All these
10:47
different human or robot companies
10:49
actually have a pathway to be successful
10:52
in in their ventures because they are
10:54
going for the more like the less
10:58
generalized and like the halfway point
11:01
because the market is so unbelievably
11:03
large that a okay hand will get you a
11:08
slice of the pie.
11:09
I mean it honestly doesn't even have to
11:11
be a hand for some things.
11:14
Yeah. just whatever you know if you're
11:18
doing a job where a human uses a tool to
11:20
do that job, you just put that tool on
11:23
the end of the arms instead of a hand of
11:25
any kind and there you go.
11:30
Yeah, this is this is a very fascinating
11:32
comment. Also, there's room for
11:34
generalized and specialized bots and
11:36
that's no different than like using
11:37
humans or machines at a factory
11:39
or a warehouse.
11:42
Fascinating, huh?
11:44
Yeah.
11:46
Yeah. It's, you know, I'm thinking
11:48
about, you know, like these these
11:50
shortcuts that would get you to a better
11:51
solution. And it just reminds me of Elon
11:55
like saying, "No, we're going to take
11:57
the hard medicine, strip out radar,
11:59
strip out LAR, we're going vision only."
12:01
Um, it's the goal maximum. And to
12:05
maximize shareholder value, what you
12:06
actually want to do is sprint to that
12:08
goal maximum as fast as possible and
12:11
like blood, sweat, and tears. And it's
12:12
going to be painful and you're going to
12:13
like screw up along the way and realize
12:16
that you were like super dumb.
12:17
But um
12:18
and people are going to scream at you
12:19
that what that guy's doing over there,
12:21
that shortcut that he took, that's the
12:22
better road. You guys are [ __ ]
12:25
Just whimo this crap.
12:27
Yeah. But but now like like I think
12:29
we're just about to to bear the the
12:31
fruit of that approach with with um FSD
12:35
the car and like it's then it's going to
12:37
become super obvious that like oh yeah
12:38
like of course vision only is like the
12:39
the right way to do it and look how
12:41
scalable it is. Look took years.
12:42
Well exactly.
12:44
Exactly. So like I think there's going
12:46
to be
12:47
and then people will say that
12:49
Tesla and Elon were lucky.
12:51
Once it scales it'll be like wow they
12:53
got so lucky with this overnight
12:55
success.
12:55
Wow.
12:56
Yeah. But no, like he I vividly remember
13:00
on this 2017 earnings call, he was
13:02
talking about this approach and and why
13:04
you want to maximize for the or uh
13:06
optimize for the goal maximum, not the
13:08
local maximum. And I was just like, oh
13:10
my gosh, that is like so brilliant. Like
13:12
it was
13:14
um but yeah, it's I I think it'll be
13:16
faster than 10 years because there have
13:17
been so many advances in AI and they've
13:19
already built up so much of the
13:20
infrastructure. But still, I think we're
13:22
gonna have a very painful process of
13:24
struggling through this, having hands
13:26
that don't work,
13:28
all sorts of
13:29
Yeah. having to build a supply chain
13:31
for all that that he mentioned. Like
13:33
that's super hard. Yeah.
13:35
Is it 20? This is a This is a Tesla
13:37
doesn't become a uh a human or robot a
13:42
generalized human robot company until
13:44
2030 at the earliest 2031 2032.
13:50
I would be surprised if generalized
13:52
humanoid robotics profits overtake
13:56
cyber like car robo taxi revenue until
14:00
like late 2030s maybe early 2040s.
14:04
I'll take the under.
14:06
I'll take the under.
14:08
I I think I think Oh, sorry. Profits or
14:10
revenues?
14:13
Uh
14:13
I mean you you pick.
14:16
Um, oh, this is fun.
14:22
Holy [ __ ] Um,
14:27
I say 2036 bot overtakes uh FSD.
14:32
Yeah, I was thinking late. Yeah, like
14:34
past 2035.
14:37
Yeah.
14:37
And like like super bearish would be
14:39
into the 2040s.
14:41
Yeah, I don't think so. I think I think
14:42
this is one of those things where like
14:43
10 years from now, we don't know what
14:45
kind of breakthroughs we're going to get
14:46
because okay, what is what is the or is
14:49
AI going to start helping us design
14:50
hands in like two to three years?
14:52
For sure.
14:53
Yeah, that's that's going to be a huge
14:54
breakthrough. I
14:55
I I think 2032
14:59
2032.
15:01
Yeah. I I mean I just think first of
15:03
all, the TAM is so much larger. Um
15:06
second of all, they've already got these
15:07
tools. the I think the rate of
15:10
improvement is accelerating and and um
15:14
you know I think you you put all those
15:16
things together. Um yeah and keep in
15:19
mind like Tesla doesn't have to come up
15:20
with all the breakthroughs. I mean like
15:22
transformers were an industrywide
15:23
breakthrough that helped everything. I
15:25
mean look at the scale of compute that's
15:27
being built now. Like that's going to
15:29
Yeah.
15:29
really accelerate things.
15:31
Yeah.
15:34
Yeah. Okay.
15:37
that that feels like a very realistic
15:39
time frame for when this stuff's going
15:41
to actually kick in.
15:43
Um,
15:45
and again, like this is why this call,
15:48
honestly, this call is probably a bigger
15:50
deal than most people realize the more I
15:52
think about it because there there is a
15:54
lot of like when when is the last time
15:56
we've had this crystallized of an
15:58
outlook for the next 5 to 10 years for
15:59
Tesla?
16:01
I feel like it's been very hazy because
16:03
we were waiting on unsupervised and we
16:05
were waiting on something for the bot to
16:07
kind of give us an idea of when when
16:08
it's going to kick in. Feel like we got
16:10
both on this call. I don't know if you
16:12
guys agree with I don't know if that
16:13
that's me being optimistic or not, but
16:14
it just feels like the next 5 to 10
16:17
years of Tesla has been crystallized
16:19
where you can actually sit down and make
16:21
a 80%
16:23
confidence
16:25
uh model about where Tesla's likely to
16:27
be in the next 5 to 10 years. I don't
16:30
think we've had that for a minute.
16:33
Yeah, I think we've been a little bit
16:35
overoptimistic about optimists in the
16:37
community for a while just in terms of
16:40
timelines and um
16:43
yeah, and then maybe even a little bit
16:44
optimistic on
16:46
FSD timelines in some areas, but it does
16:49
feel like we're we're right there on on
16:52
FSD on robo taxi. And yeah, like if
16:56
we'll see what the broader conversation
16:57
is, you know, do do people agree with us
16:59
on Optimus and like how hard this
17:03
challenge is going to be or is it just
17:05
going to be a few people who are kind of
17:07
realistic on it and then everyone else
17:08
is still like, yeah, we're going to have
17:10
millions of optimists by 2028.
17:15
You know what's the crystallization for
17:17
me for robo taxi is I think the
17:19
ownership model is only going to get
17:21
bigger.
17:23
I think I think people remember when we
17:25
had Andrea on the pod a while ago and
17:28
she was like I'm still not convinced if
17:29
people are going to like not own a car
17:32
or own a self-driving car. I think I
17:34
think more people are going to own a
17:36
self-driving car than use one
17:39
because the the cost of owning a
17:41
self-driving car is is going to
17:44
deflation is going to kick in in a lot
17:45
of different ways. So, the cost of
17:47
owning your own car that will take you
17:49
anywhere that will have a steering wheel
17:52
and pedal for the foreseeable future
17:54
still, well, that's not going to go away
17:56
in the next 10 years at all globally. No
18:00
way, dude. There's going to be a 10-year
18:02
period where, like you said, like it's a
18:04
horse, you know, horse and sort of car
18:06
period where the regulation is not going
18:08
to be there globally for for Tesla to
18:11
just go fully driverless. that they
18:13
would be psychotic to do that because
18:15
they would just have idle capacity left,
18:17
front and center. They will have idle
18:18
capacity everywhere. Well, so I mean the
18:24
thing that could happen like the the
18:26
unspoken scenario that seems to be how
18:30
it's played out so far is that Elon does
18:34
not bring in more manufacturing
18:37
production capacity until they have
18:39
clear line of sight to markets that they
18:43
can deliver the cars into that they
18:45
actually gate like they don't make any
18:47
more driver and or steering and pedals
18:50
cars then basically they do currently
18:53
and then they only expand production
18:56
as they can go with the other that
18:58
seemed like he's been very conservative
19:00
with his cash. He's been very
19:01
conservative with his capacity build
19:03
out. Um now you like I don't know if
19:06
that's how it's going to play out but
19:08
that's what we are seeing from him
19:10
currently is that he is matching their
19:14
manufacturing capacity to driverless
19:18
like market the market's ability to
19:20
digest driverless vehicles.
19:24
So all new factories will make only
19:27
driverless vehicles.
19:32
It's a possibility.
19:35
Um
19:37
what what if the demand for a I mean
19:40
like he like okay what is the demand for
19:43
a car where you can text and drive all
19:46
the time
19:50
seems seems like the entire car market
19:55
right so if that's the case if that's a
19:58
true statement let's say let's say 80%
20:01
of drivers on the road would prefer to
20:02
have a car where they can text and drive
20:04
or do whatever or not even text and
20:06
drive whatever you know watch a movie
20:08
and drive whatever sleep and drive take
20:11
a nap and drive
20:13
that that percentage like those people
20:15
will demand a vehicle that can do that
20:18
they will demand one and Tesla would be
20:21
psychotic to not sell that in those
20:23
markets and so the question becomes
20:25
will those you're talking about Elon
20:28
he's clearly a psychotic person he's
20:29
like no I won't sell you one that has a
20:31
driver or a steering wheel and pedals
20:33
I'll only you can go rent one. It's a
20:36
cyber cab and it's available over there
20:37
with with AI5. This thing is going to
20:39
drive itself in the middle of nowhere
20:41
Africa.
20:43
Okay.
20:44
Yeah.
20:45
So So you're telling me that Elon's
20:47
going to be like, "No, I 4 billion
20:49
people. It's okay." Nah, I'm just going
20:51
to sit on this until I can sell it to
20:52
you without a steering wheel and pedal.
20:54
I'm going to wait until I can yank
20:55
$2,000 worth of cost. Not even.
20:59
It's not about the It's not about the
21:00
costs of the thing. I think it's about
21:03
like he wants the other the people who
21:05
want that experience, he wants them to
21:07
feel the pain necessary to motivate them
21:11
to enact the correct set of regulations
21:14
so that he can sell the cyber cab.
21:18
I I just think I don't even know I don't
21:22
even understand that argument
21:25
for regul You want the people with the
21:27
regulations to feel the pain of not
21:28
having his car. I mean maybe I
21:29
misunderstood your your
21:31
Yeah. Yeah. like he wants, you know, he
21:33
wants the people of Germany who don't
21:35
get to have a cyber cab to go knocking
21:39
down all of their regul regulators doors
21:43
be like we have to have this here now
21:44
like fix your stupid regulations so that
21:47
we can have cyber cabs
21:49
I
21:50
because what's the difference between
21:52
unsupervised FSD with a person in it and
21:57
cyber cabab
21:58
exact that's my point
21:59
there is not a difference Yeah. If if
22:01
there's not a difference.
22:02
So I'm saying if the regulator approves
22:04
the one, then the other is approved.
22:07
No,
22:07
there's not a world in which
22:10
that's not true.
22:12
That's fundamentally.
22:14
Like if if you don't actually have to
22:15
pay attention behind the wheel,
22:18
you're doing this autism thing again,
22:19
Hans.
22:21
I'm I'm communicating Elon's autism to
22:24
you, Sir Norby.
22:26
You must feel the pain of Elon's autism.
22:29
Yes. It just continually stabs me like,
22:32
"Ah, here's the autism." Just feel it.
22:34
No, I just But but again, like that's
22:37
that's so crazy. Like the the cyber cab
22:41
is the such a perfect form factor for
22:43
Europe and the the the the market that
22:47
is the perfect the perfect market for a
22:49
cyber cab or cyber cab like with a
22:52
steering wheel and pedal. He's going to
22:54
be like, "Fuck you. I'm not going to
22:55
sell you that until you let me sell it
22:57
with a steering without a steering wheel
22:58
and pedal." that
23:03
in the mosture in the most bureaucrat
23:06
heavy market on the planet.
23:09
Damn, dude. I don't know, brother. I
23:11
mean, dude, if he does that, props.
23:14
Props to him.
23:15
I guarantee you that's his position in
23:17
the argument. Like, I don't know that he
23:19
won't ever come around, but as he's
23:21
having these conversations with Tesla
23:23
management,
23:24
that's where he wants to go.
23:27
What an exciting time. This is probably
23:30
the most excited I've been about about
23:31
Tesla
23:33
ever,
23:34
personally.
23:36
I like how you said that with zero
23:38
emotion. The autism is rubbing off on
23:40
you, too.
23:41
Dude, I've been on a live stream for
23:42
five hours. I know.
23:44
Why Why did you start it so early? I saw
23:46
that. I was like, "What?" Um, yeah,
23:48
that's a good
