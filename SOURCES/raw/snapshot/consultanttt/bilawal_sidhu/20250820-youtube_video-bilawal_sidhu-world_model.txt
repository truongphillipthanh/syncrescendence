AI isn’t just generating videos anymore — it’s generating entire worlds. 🌍
In this deep dive, I’ll break down the rise of AI World Models: Google’s Genie 3, NVIDIA’s Cosmos, and OpenAI’s Sora — and why they’re the closest thing yet to a real-life Holodeck.  

As an Ex-Googler who spent years building real-world models, I’ll show you how these systems work, where they’re headed, and why this race will reshape robotics, virtual reality, and the future of content itself. IMO this tech is bigger than LLMs and a key part of AGI people miss completely. 

Covered in this video:  
• Google Genie 3: Interactive video generation and single-image 3D reconstruction.
• NVIDIA Cosmos & Omniverse: The hybrid approach to building digital twins for Embodied AI using game engine and 3d simulation technology.
• The World Model Wars: How Google, OpenAI (Sora), Runway, and NVIDIA are competing.
• Synthetic Data Revolution: A look at startups like Parallel Domain, Bifrost, and Sky Engine AI.
• The Rendering Stack of Reality: The grand challenge of creating simulations that scale from a single object to an entire city.

Introduction
0:00
With Genie 3, Google didn't just launch
0:02
a prototype. It planted the seeds of
0:04
entirely new realities nested within our
0:07
own. A place where worlds generate
0:09
themselves, machines learn inside them,
0:13
and the lines between simulation and
0:15
reality start to blur. Now, I spent
0:17
years working on real world models at
0:20
Google. So, I'm going to give you an
0:21
insider perspective on what tech like
0:24
Genie 3 and Cosmos means for the AI and
0:27
spatial computing industry. Combine this
0:29
with enterprisegrade simulation
0:31
technology that's been evolving for
0:33
years. Generative world models have real
0:36
implications for 3D today. So let's get
0:38
into it.
1. Dream Worlds at 24 FPS
0:41
All right. So quick primer on Genie.
0:43
Essentially there's a model where you
0:44
provide a text prompt, a starting image,
0:47
or even a video like Rui did over here.
0:50
and you can suddenly take control just
0:52
like you would in a video game and start
0:55
playing this experience with the model
0:57
generating the world you should be
0:59
seeing in real time at 24 frames per
1:02
second. The results are fantastic.
1:04
There's also open source variants of
1:05
this tech such as the very appropriately
1:08
named Matrix Game 2.0 uh which is
1:11
basically trained on a bunch of video
1:12
game and GTA footage. But what makes
1:14
Genie different is of course that this
1:16
is trained on the entirety of YouTube,
1:18
right? This is the motherload of visual
1:20
data sets. It almost makes it feel like
1:24
playing a dream, right? Like this
1:26
controlled hallucination of reality and
1:28
it makes you wonder the nature of our
1:30
own existence. But not to go too deep
1:32
down the rabbit hole, take a look at
1:34
this example of Google researchers
1:36
playing with Genie 3 in a conference
1:38
room where suddenly that video is put
1:40
inside a Genie 3 world and now you have
1:43
a simulation within a simulation.
2. Painting the Third Dimension
1:46
[Music]
1:47
Now, a really cool byproduct of this
1:49
model that's seen the visual complexity
1:51
of the world and can generate worlds on
1:53
demand is that it can basically do
1:55
oneshot or single image 3D
1:58
reconstruction. You can take this old
2:00
famous painting of Socrates and turn it
2:03
into this explorable 3D world. And just
2:06
consider for a second that all of this
2:08
consistency is an emergent property of
2:11
the model just getting bigger rather
2:13
than the developers giving it some
2:15
explicit underlying representation like
2:17
a textured 3D mesh or a neural radiance
2:20
field. To put this to the test, I
2:22
basically took that Genie 3 world in
2:24
painted out the UI did an upscale in
2:26
Topaz and trained a Gaussian splat and a
2:29
texture 3D mesh. And suddenly you can
2:31
step inside this painting of Socrates
2:34
from 1787.
2:36
This is genuinely better than any image
2:39
to 3D model I've seen. Here's the
2:40
texture 3D mesh version which is also
2:42
really really good. You can drop this
2:44
into any app that you love. Blender,
2:46
Unreal Engine, the list goes on. And if
2:48
you're curious, I've left links to both
2:50
of these models on my Twitter post so
2:52
you can check it out over there. I'll
2:54
also leave it in the description below.
2:56
I tried this same result with the famous
2:58
Nighthawks painting and the results are
3:01
equally stellar,
3. The World Model Wars
3:04
but Google is far from the only one.
3:06
Nvidia's got Cosmos. That's their
3:08
version of a world foundation model,
3:10
really focused on physical AI, which
3:12
we'll explore in a second. Uh Runway has
3:14
been talking about general world models
3:16
since late 2023. And the idea at least
3:19
goes back to 2017. So, Crystalall says
3:22
like, "If you want to understand why
3:23
suddenly everyone's investing in video
3:24
generation world models, re-watch this
3:26
video from 2023." This is of course on
3:29
the heels of the G3 launch. So, of
3:32
course, the Genie 3 co-author dropped uh
3:35
oh, and our ICML paper from 2021 on
3:39
augmented world models. And of course,
3:41
Crystal Ball clapback saying it's like,
3:43
oh, and this 2018 paper world models by
3:46
Schmidt Huber. Schmid Hub, one of the
3:48
godfathers of AI and a a rather
3:50
controversial figure if you want to look
3:51
into him. And of course, Elon, not one
3:53
to be left out of the fun, says we will
3:56
have real time in 2 months. So, I guess
3:59
Grock's going to have real time video
4:01
generation in a short while, too. Now,
4:03
if we even go back to the launch of
4:05
Sora, they also talked about video
4:07
generation as world simulators. sort of
4:09
this idea that if you want to create an
4:11
AI that understands the physical world,
4:15
a good way to test its understanding of
4:17
the physical world is to have it
4:20
generate the real world and have those
4:22
be plausible and ideally factual
4:25
reconstructions or renditions of uh what
4:28
you would expect in reality. And really,
4:30
if you take a step back, all of these
4:32
companies are essentially trying to
4:33
recreate the hollow deck from Star Trek,
4:35
right? like sort of this idea of being
4:38
able to generate worlds and experiences
4:40
on demand that you can step inside and
4:43
interact with just like you would with a
4:45
video game except this video game is
4:48
indistinguishable from reality. Now
4:50
look, there are different ways of going
4:51
about creating these world models,
4:53
right? With Genie 3, Google is basically
4:55
taking all of YouTube and training this
4:58
model on it and suddenly it can predict
5:00
what the next frame should be given a
5:02
set of input events. That's kind of all
5:04
it needs to do. And it turns out the
5:06
bitter lesson is bittersweet for a
5:08
reason because as you keep scaling up
5:10
the data sets and the compute that you
5:12
throw at it, it turns out you just get
5:14
consistency as an emergent property. And
5:16
it may well be that you keep scaling up
5:18
this type of an approach and suddenly
5:20
you would have something that would be
5:22
like an Unreal Engine 6 with all of the
5:24
physics that you've come to expect from
5:26
it.
4. Robot Jungle Gyms
5:28
Now Nvidia and other players in the
5:30
space are taking more of a hybrid
5:32
approach. This is how they're thinking
5:34
about this problem of creating a
5:36
simulated digital twin of reality. This
5:39
implies this is a twin of something that
5:41
exists in the physical world. So, we
5:43
have a factual rendition of it. What do
5:44
we mean when we're talking about robot
5:46
simulations? And why do these world
5:48
models need to play into it? Well, think
5:50
about a self-driving car, for example.
5:52
It's got some sensors, maybe has LAR,
5:54
some RGB cameras. It can perceive the
5:56
world, and that that produces these
5:58
sensor tokens. And maybe you have some
6:00
directions you're giving your car. car
6:02
is like, "Yo, take me home and take the
6:03
highway." That produces these text
6:05
tokens that goes into this policy model
6:07
that basically produces action tokens,
6:09
meaning like steering commands or maybe
6:11
way points on the road in 3D space that
6:14
it needs to take next to and essentially
6:16
get you home. Um, so what happens is you
6:19
want in a robotic simulation for the
6:21
system to be able to take that action
6:23
token, right, and then predict the next
6:26
world state. That's where the simulation
6:28
is so important because that prediction
6:30
needs to be as close to the real world
6:32
as possible. Like the margin of error is
6:34
non-existent. Otherwise, you're going to
6:36
have a dangerous robot in the real
6:37
world. And we don't want that, right?
6:39
Nvidia is taking a hybrid approach where
6:41
they're taking the best of classical 3D
6:43
approaches and blending them with
6:45
generative AI. Let me explain what that
6:47
means. So, for example, you may have
6:49
this amazing radiance field of a
6:51
racetrack, right? Like that's super
6:52
cool. This is very close to what the
6:55
actual camera saw, but you do need the
6:57
mesh reconstruction, right? So your
6:59
physics engine knows how exactly to
7:01
react and respond to the surfaces that
7:03
exist in the world. So then when you
7:05
take all of those pieces together of a
7:06
classical approach, of a generative
7:09
approach, you get something like this
7:10
where you can basically reproduce the
7:12
input and create infinite variations.
7:16
So, for example, if you want to create a
7:18
scenario where an animal walks in front
7:20
of a car, boom, you've got a really good
7:22
clip and now you augment it with
7:23
different types of animals. Maybe you're
7:25
walking through San Francisco and you
7:27
want to see it up in flames, which I
7:28
guess happens on the regular these days.
7:30
So, I don't know, maybe you'd be able to
7:32
capture that in real life. But you can
7:34
create all sorts of other variations,
7:36
seasonality, weather conditions, the
7:39
list goes on. And this gets powerful,
7:40
right? because suddenly you can start
7:42
using these world models as sort of like
7:43
a jungle gym for robots, a generative
7:45
training facility. So if you've got, you
7:47
know, if you have a robot that's
7:49
collected data in one environment,
7:51
suddenly you can have that one skill
7:53
replicated across all sorts of new
7:55
environments, you could also perhaps
7:57
have it do many skills in the same
7:59
environment and then of course many new
8:01
skills in many new environments, right?
8:03
And so you can imagine how a very small
8:06
amount of really good real world data
8:08
can be augmented with synthetic training
8:10
data to create a much larger corpus for
8:13
your robot to train on. So who knew your
8:15
robot would be docking every single
8:17
night and dreaming just like we do,
8:19
thinking about how it can do a better
8:21
job the next day?
5. Synthetic Data Revolution
8:24
Robotics is very clearly a data problem.
8:27
The reason we've had such an easy time
8:29
with text and code generation, things
8:31
like that, is because we've got the
8:33
mother lode of data on the internet.
8:35
We've spent decades essentially creating
8:38
a digital twin of all human knowledge
8:40
and creativity. And that's what everyone
8:42
is training off the public internet
8:44
right now. On the video side, you've got
8:46
some advantages if you own something
8:48
like YouTube or maybe you're like Bite
8:50
Dance and you own Tik Tok, etc. But for
8:52
this type of firsterson view video that
8:55
you need for like a robot, let's say
8:57
doing a bunch of tasks, a humanoid robot
8:59
specifically, it's super challenging.
9:00
And same thing with driving, right?
9:02
Despite all the dash cam footage,
9:04
despite all the street view footage, you
9:06
do not have enough observations of the
9:08
physical world. Now, there are a bunch
9:10
of companies that are doing this type of
9:12
synthetic training data generation for,
9:15
you know, autonomous driving startups.
9:16
In fact, Scale AAI, which was recently
9:18
purchased by Meta, got their start doing
9:20
this type of labeling that you see over
9:22
here. But these companies take all of
9:25
that data and kind of create the final
9:27
output that you'd need to train on for
9:29
all the scenarios that you perhaps care
9:31
about that you haven't captured in the
9:33
real world. And as you can see, they're
9:35
doing this with a mix of, you know, kind
9:37
of photoggramometric and neural
9:39
reconstruction approaches combined with
9:41
traditional game engines and simulation
9:44
combined with generative AI perhaps to
9:46
give it that final pass to make it look
9:48
more like that fisheye sensor in a rainy
9:50
environment, you know, when you'd see it
9:52
on a car itself. So, you can think of
9:54
something like Bifrost, which is another
9:56
company doing this stuff, essentially as
9:57
this like hybrid game engine where you
9:59
can do all of these things, right? Like
10:01
maybe there's a real world reference
10:03
that you're trying to replicate an
10:04
interesting scenario on and you
10:06
essentially get this like Unreal Engine
10:08
cloudstream builder environment to kind
10:10
of build it all out. Let's say you're
10:12
training an autonomous amphibian vessel.
10:14
Boom. Suddenly you've got that type of
10:16
data. And then somebody comes to you and
10:18
says, I need different weather and
10:19
lighting conditions. And well, boom, you
10:21
just go about doing that. And the beauty
10:23
of doing this synthetically, especially
10:25
with explicit 3D game engines or 3D
10:28
content creation tools, is the fact that
10:30
everything is already annotated, right?
10:33
Like all your annotations are basically
10:36
given to you for free, which you can
10:38
then pass along to some ML model. So
10:39
it's really good at detecting, let's
10:41
say, if the seat belt is on or off. Is
10:43
the driver paying attention? Which
10:44
direction were they looking in? And you
10:46
could transfer that headpose data, not
10:48
just bounding boxes, uh, to your model.
10:50
And so that's sort of the beauty of
10:52
generative AI. This love this guy taking
10:55
a yawn. Um, you know, so for the
10:57
uninitiated, some of these cars have
10:59
this attention awareness feature where,
11:00
you know, if you're not paying attention
11:02
uh to the road, looking at your phone,
11:04
etc., it'll start nudging you
11:05
essentially.
6. Cities That Think
11:08
Now, this doesn't just imply to robots
11:10
in the traditional sense, like a car or
11:12
a humanoid robot. It also applies to
11:14
facilities or buildings or even entire
11:17
cities. So this is what Nvidia means
11:19
when they're talking about bringing
11:20
physical AI to cities and industrial
11:22
infrastructure. And if you think about
11:24
it, this is exactly the kind of
11:25
infrastructure where you need systems to
11:27
be able to navigate, but you also
11:29
already have a bunch of sensors in these
11:30
spaces and places. Traffic is a really
11:32
good example, right? So this is a
11:34
company called Data from Sky. And
11:35
basically what their tech lets you do is
11:38
if you've got, you know, CCTV cameras or
11:41
you're doing a drone survey, it can
11:43
track every single car across camera
11:45
view. So it'll detect a car, give it a
11:48
stable ID, an identifier, and make sure
11:51
that ID is persistent across every
11:53
single camera view that you get. And
11:56
this is a really good way of, for
11:57
example, surveying how dense is traffic
12:00
at different times of day. There's one
12:02
way to do that, which is how Google does
12:04
it with the location data on your phone,
12:06
but that's so coarse grain and it needs
12:08
to be aggregated over very many users to
12:11
be privacy preserving. In this case, you
12:13
can get a far more binary grain view of
12:15
what's going on in an actual moment. So,
12:18
of course, extending our analogy, you
12:20
can take something like Blender and the
12:21
city generator plugin for it and create
12:24
a synthetic rendition of that exact
12:26
intersection and layer on those actual
12:28
tracks. So, you've got very close to
12:30
realworld traffic patterns inside your
12:33
simulation in which you could, let's
12:35
say, ask a car to drive around and do
12:37
things. So, this gets very powerful,
12:39
right? Suddenly both static and dynamic
12:42
objects from the real world can be
12:44
imported into the simulation where you
12:46
create all sorts of permutations and
12:48
combinations. So to give you some
12:50
examples, let's say I've got this real
12:52
world capture of the Loi Garden in New
12:54
Delhi. Suddenly I can imagine it in
12:56
different lighting conditions using
12:58
tools like runways ALF. Right here is me
13:00
using runway ALF and Luma's video model
13:03
for more of a media and entertainment
13:04
use case. But you can imagine for like
13:06
public safety if you want to train
13:08
drones to be able to fly around after
13:10
let's say a disaster has just happened
13:12
well you want to train it on a
13:14
destructed version of the city. Now if
13:15
you saw my Google Earth documentary then
13:17
you know Google has amassed all this
13:19
historical imagery. But think about it
13:21
if you can look back in time you can
13:24
also use AI to predict forwards in time
13:27
too. And Google actually took a huge
13:29
step towards this like bringing together
13:31
something like a chat GPT for Earth. So
13:34
think about it, right? Like you've got
13:35
all of this optical data, this radar
13:37
data, LAR data, climate data about every
13:40
single part of the world. What if we
13:41
just break up the world into these 10x
13:44
10 meter squares and just create
13:46
embeddings for them? Essentially distill
13:48
down and create these compact summaries
13:50
of all that data that you can literally
13:53
ask questions to just like chat GPT.
13:56
We're going to have this on every
13:57
possible scale that you can imagine from
14:00
the world to your country to your city
14:02
to your home where you can go and ask
14:05
questions to your home.
7. The Holodeck Approaches
14:08
Now, of course, not only can we train
14:10
robots in these simulations, but we'll
14:12
step inside them too with VR headsets.
14:14
So, let's talk about the implications
14:16
for media and entertainment, both
14:18
immersive content and also just general
14:20
flat content we distribute freely on the
14:22
internet. Now, going back to the hollow
14:24
deck idea, the fact that with some of
14:26
these fully generative interactive world
14:28
models, you're already embodied. You can
14:30
step inside of puddles and recreate the
14:32
physics that you can see. I think this
14:34
is the killer use case for AR VR, right?
14:37
Like Google's got their XR headsets
14:39
coming out. Of course, they're thinking
14:41
about how generative media plays into
14:43
that. And just think about it, since
14:44
we've got an interactive world, creating
14:46
that 65 mm interpupilary distance to
14:49
create steroscopic depth is so possible.
14:51
And you can do it without a game engine.
14:53
Even if it's you just creating, let's
14:55
say, a fisheye rendition of the world
14:57
that you see, then another model for
15:00
upscaling it, another model for doing 2D
15:02
to 3D conversion, like to create an even
15:05
faster, lower latency pipeline to go
15:07
from like 24 fps to like 100 fps. I
15:11
could see that being more of an
15:12
engineering problem than a research one
15:14
at this point. So, in my opinion, the
15:15
holiday is closer than you think. It's
15:18
certainly closer than I thought. Now, of
15:20
course, we also talked about how you can
15:22
use these type of models to do 3D
15:24
reconstructions of the world and extract
15:26
3D models or 3D radiance fields, right?
15:29
So, you can extract 3D models out of
15:31
these and use them in your traditional
15:33
virtual production workflows, right?
15:34
Like if you want to frame that shot of
15:36
the talent walking by and record that
15:38
with your phone camera just to see
15:41
exactly what it'll look like, record
15:42
those takes and then render them
15:44
properly on the computer. You can
15:46
totally do that. In fact, tools like
15:48
Jetet even let you bring in that
15:50
Gaussian splat and previsualize and use
15:52
it for previs on the phone itself, which
15:55
is really cool. Now, I've talked about
15:56
this in the past, but I'm really really
15:58
bullish on this hybrid approach, right?
16:00
Clearly, it's the thing that works right
16:02
now as we wait for fully neural or fully
16:05
generative approaches to reach that
16:07
level of simulation accuracy that you
16:09
can get um you know, with explicit 3D
16:12
approaches. My vision there is
16:14
essentially you've got this 3D
16:15
environment that you flesh out. You
16:16
define, hey, these are the sets that I
16:18
care about. These are the actors that I
16:20
care about. These are the props. This is
16:22
the time of day. This is the look that
16:24
I'm going for. And then you essentially
16:26
go into director mode, sort of like you
16:27
can today with something like convey
16:29
sim, which lets you create these sort of
16:31
like AI agents that are inside Unreal
16:33
Engine. And they give you a very
16:35
lightweight guey, by the way, to go
16:37
create that without even need to touch
16:38
Unreal yourself. And then you can go and
16:41
essentially talk to these characters and
16:43
actually command them to do things too.
16:45
Suddenly you're like the director on set
16:48
feeling like James Cameron in your
16:50
freaking basement commanding your roster
16:52
of talent to get exactly the shots that
16:55
you want. So definitely check out convey
16:57
sim as well if you want to play around
16:58
with these technologies and think you
17:00
could take something like this and run
17:01
it through runway alif or your favorite
17:04
videotovideo model of choice like luma.
17:06
In fact, if you want to see a workflow
17:08
not so much optimized for talking
17:10
characters, but everything else all in
17:13
one UI, you got to check out this really
17:16
cool tool called Intangible. And
17:18
essentially, this is exactly what it
17:19
does, right? And essentially, what you
17:20
can do in this tool is use natural
17:22
language to describe the scene that you
17:23
want to create. It'll populate the world
17:25
with actual explicit 3D assets that you
17:27
can move around. you frame the cameras
17:29
just the right way and then you can use
17:31
something like Flux and then V3 all in
17:34
one interface to take it all the way. So
17:36
having this combination of the
17:38
editability of a 3D environment all in a
17:40
browser along with the creativity of
17:43
generative models feels like a really
17:46
really cool hybrid pipeline that is
17:48
super underrated.
8. The Rendering Stack of Reality
17:51
Now to wrap things up let me talk to you
17:53
about the future of 3D. You know, every
17:55
year when sigraph happens, it really
17:57
puts it into focus for me just how much
17:59
of an unsolved problem computer graphics
18:01
and simulation really is. And this
18:03
example might tell you why. Think about
18:05
it. Let's say you wanted to create a
18:06
photorealistic rendition of a bowl of
18:08
strawberries down to the microructures,
18:11
the multi-layered materials, the
18:13
freaking fur that you see on these
18:16
strawberries. You could probably do it
18:18
in a modern 3D tool. Absolutely could do
18:20
it. You certainly do it with an AI
18:22
generator. But then consider that that
18:24
bowl of cherries actually sits on a
18:26
breakfast table that itself sits in this
18:28
apartment building that sits in this
18:30
block inside of a massive city. To have
18:33
simulations of the real world that scale
18:35
seamlessly from strawberry scale down to
18:38
city scale is a very open-ended problem.
18:41
as Aaron Lefon said, who's the VP of
18:43
research at NVIDIA, that we're going to
18:45
need completely new tools so that
18:46
artists can even conceptualize, create,
18:48
and iterate like order of magnitudes
18:50
faster than you can today to make sense
18:52
of this exact scale to have a simulation
18:55
of the world inside your computer. And
18:58
to be honest, we don't even know the 3D
19:00
representations we'll need to get there.
19:02
Is it going to be, you know, radiance
19:03
field stuff like Gaussian splatting?
19:05
We've got triangle splatting now. Is it
19:07
going to be like this hybrid approach of
19:09
bounding boxes plus fully generative? Is
19:12
it going to be completely generative end
19:14
to end? The bitter lesson reigns
19:16
supreme. We just end up creating enough
19:17
synthetic training data from all these
19:20
simulations so that we can just get it
19:21
all for free from one blackbox neural
19:23
network. Maybe. Not to mention, we're
19:25
going to need entirely new ways of
19:27
generating 3D content. Like the
19:29
metaverse is a rather empty place
19:31
without interesting 3D content. and
19:33
we're just starting to scratch the
19:34
surface of what we can do with those
19:37
type of approaches. So, I don't think
19:38
anyone knows which approach is going to
19:40
re supreme and win in the end. Is it
19:42
going to be a fully neural approach like
19:44
G3 or is it going to be some sort of a
19:46
hybrid approach like we saw with
19:48
Intangible or what Nvidia is doing with
19:50
Omniverse Plus Cosmos? But what I do
19:52
know is that we are just scratching the
19:54
surface of what we need to create both
19:56
the ultimate digital twin of reality and
19:59
the real world hollow deck. And damn, it
20:02
really makes you appreciate whoever
20:03
wrote the rendering stack for reality.
20:05
That's it for this video. Bolav signing
20:07
off and I'll see y'all in the next one.
