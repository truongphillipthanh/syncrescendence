What will be the most important trends in AI in  2026? Well, we take a stab at this every year  
0:06
with with some success, I would say. And this  time out, I have the knowledgeable assistance  
0:11
of my colleague, Aaron Baughman, to help us out.  Well, yeah. You know, after your prediction  
0:16
of infinite memory last year, I thought maybe  you could use just a little bit of help. Yeah,  
0:20
that's that's fair. Well, how about we each take  four trends each? That sounds good. How about you  
0:26
first? All right. Okay. So my number one trend  of 2026 is multi-agent orchestration. Now last  
0:36
year we said 2025 was the year of the agent.  AI agents that can reason and plan and take  
0:42
action on a task and agents I think it's fair  to say really delivered. There are new numerous  
0:47
agentic platforms for tasks like coding and basic  computer use but no single agent really excels at  
0:55
everything. So, what if you had a whole team of  agents working together? So, maybe we've got an  
1:01
agent here that kind of acts as a planner agent  that decomposes goals into steps. Maybe we have  
1:08
some worker agents here that do different  steps like one specializes in writing code,  
1:15
others call APIs and so forth. And then perhaps  we have a critic agent that evaluates outputs and  
1:22
flags issues. And these agents collaborate under  a coordinating layer that is the orchestrator.  
1:33
And multi-agent setups like this help introduce  cross-checking where one agent checks the other  
1:38
agents work and it can break problems into more  discrete verifiable steps. Well, great. So,  
1:45
how could I really follow that trend?  Well, I think I might just have one. So,  
1:49
the second one is going to be the digital labor  workforce. So now these are digital workers that  
1:56
are autonomous agents that can do a couple  of items. So the first one is they can parse  
2:01
a task by interpreting multimodal input. So after  preparation the worker then executes what's called  
2:08
a workflow. Now this is where at the end of an  action plan you know it would follow a sequence of  
2:15
steps but then it has to be integrated into some  sort of system that then in turn can take action.  
2:22
And these could be downstream components. Now  these systems are then further enhanced by what we  
2:27
call human-in-the-loop AI, which then provides a  couple of items. The first one would be oversight.  
2:33
The next one would be correction and then we're  looking at these strategic guidance or these rails  
2:38
um to ensure that all of these agents are doing  what they're supposed to be doing. Now this  
2:43
overall trend will create a force multiplying  effect to extend human capability. Now trend  
2:49
number three is physical AI. Now we all know that  large language models they generate text like ABC.  
3:00
And then there are other models as well. So for  example there are plenty of diffusion image models  
3:06
and they generate pixels. They generate images.  These are all operating in digital space. Now,  
3:14
physical AI is about models that understand and  interact with the world that we live in, the the  
3:21
real 3D world. And this is about models that can  perceive their environment, reason about physics,  
3:29
and that can take physical action like robotics.  So, previously getting a robot like this to do  
3:37
something useful meant programming explicit rules.  So if you see an obstacle, you should turn left,  
3:44
for example. And it was all done by humans. It  was up to yeah, smart guys like this to code these  
3:53
rules. Now, physical AI kind of flips that around.  So you train models in simulation that simulate  
4:03
the real world and it learns to understand  how objects behave in the physical world,  
4:08
how gravity works, how to grasp something without  crushing it. Now these models are sometimes called  
4:16
world foundation models. They're generative models  that can create and understand 3D environments.  
4:23
They can predict what happens next in a physical  scene. And in 2026, many of these world models are  
4:30
taking things like those humanoid robots that you  found there, Aaron, and they're taking them from  
4:36
research to commercial production. Physical AI  is scaling. Well, Martin, you just took my trend,  
4:43
but let's just go ahead and say number four is  about social computing. Now, this is a world  
4:49
where many agents and humans operate within the  shared AI fabric. So say if I have an agent here  
4:55
and then a human here. So they're going to be  connected through this fabric and here if I  
5:02
have information that flows between the two, they  begin to understand each other and then they can  
5:08
gather what the intent is going to be. And then  once they have the intent and information, they  
5:13
have actions. They can affect each other or maybe  even the environment of which they're in. But all  
5:19
of this flows seamlessly across this system. It's  this shared space that enables collaboration,  
5:25
context exchange as well as event effective  understanding. Now the outcome is really an  
5:30
empathetic emergent network of these interactions.  It's what we call this collective intelligence  
5:35
or this real world swarm computing. So teams of  agents, digital labor, humanoid robots, and tech  
5:43
that can understand me with effective computing.  2026 could be uh quite the year and we're only  
5:50
halfway through the trends. So trend number five  that is verifiable AI. Now the EU AI act is coming  
6:03
and by mid 2026 it becomes fully applicable.  And think of this a little bit like GDPR but for  
6:10
artificial intelligence. Now, the core idea here  is that AI systems, especially high-risk ones,  
6:17
need to be auditable and they also need to  be traceable. Now, what does that mean? Well,  
6:22
it means a few things. It means documentation.  So, if you're building high-risk AI, you need  
6:29
technical docs that demonstrate compliance to  how you tested the models and the risks that you  
6:34
identified. It means transparency. So, users need  to know when they're interacting with the machine.  
6:41
So things like synthetic text, they need to be  clearly labeled and it means data lineage. You  
6:48
need to be able to summarize where your training  data came from and prove you respected copyright  
6:53
optouts. And just like how GDPR has shaped global  privacy, not just folks in the EU, the EU AI act  
7:01
will probably set the template for AI governance  worldwide. Wow, that's great. And you know, trend  
7:07
number six, right? It really changes everything,  but it also changes nothing at the same time.  
7:13
And now this is where we put in quantum utility  everywhere. So 2026 is where we start to see this  
7:20
quantum computing to reliably start solving  real world problems better, faster, or more  
7:26
efficiently than classical computing methods. Now,  at this point, we have this quantum utility scale.  
7:32
is these systems that begin working alongside and  together with classical infrastructure to deliver  
7:37
these practical value in everyday workflows. Now,  this is going to help with optimization and then  
7:44
we'll also look at simulation and decision-making.  Now, all three of these tasks were previously  
7:50
out of reach within the classical realm. But this  hybrid quantum classical error, it will begin to  
7:56
transform quantum computing into this mainstream  paradigm as it's going to be woven into our  
8:01
everyday business operations. Now my trend number  seven is reasoning at the edge. Now last year, we  
8:10
talked about very small models, models with just  a few billion parameters that don't need huge  
8:14
data centers to run. They work on your laptop  or well maybe even your phone. Well, in 2026,  
8:21
those small models are learning to think. So, if  we think about the best models that we have today,  
8:27
the frontier models, well, pretty much all of them  now use something called inference time compute.  
8:36
They spend extra time thinking before giving you  an answer, working through problems step by step.  
8:42
Now, the trade-off for that is they need more  compute. But here's what's changing. Essentially,  
8:49
teams have figured out how they can distill all  of this reasoning information into smaller models.  
8:59
So now these smaller models can perform thinking  as well. You're taking massive reasoning models  
9:05
that generate tons of step-by-step solutions and  we're using that data to train the smaller models  
9:12
to reason the same way. And that's resulting  in reasoning models with only a few billion  
9:17
parameters. They work offline. Your data never  leaves your device. And there's no roundtrip  
9:22
latency to a data center. So for anything that's  real time or mission critical, having a model that  
9:28
can actually reason through a problem locally is  a pretty big deal. Yeah. So that's all very true,  
9:35
Martin. But now our last and final trend is number  eight. So this is what we're calling amorphous  
9:42
hybrid computing. So this is a future where both  AI model topologies and the cloud infrastructure,  
9:48
they blend into what's called a fluid computing  backbone. So AI models, they're shifting beyond  
9:53
just this pure transformer design, right? They're  beginning to evolve into these other architectures  
9:59
that integrate transformers and we call them  these state space models. And then in 2026,  
10:06
you're also going to see different emerging  algorithms that are combine both the state space  
10:11
and transformers and other elements together,  right? And that's going to be really fun to watch,  
10:17
very artful. And then at the same time, we have  this cloud computing piece that's becoming fully  
10:23
differentiated by combining many different  chip types. So we're going to have CPUs,  
10:29
GPUs, TPUs as well. And finally, what we just  talked about in trend six, quantum, we're going  
10:37
to have QPUs. I did also want to mention and  note that you'll see these neuromorphic chips  
10:42
that are coming out and those emulate the brain.  But all of these are going to be put together  
10:48
right into this unified compute environment  where parts of each of these types of models,  
10:53
they're going to be automatically mapped to  the optimal compute substrate. And this is  
10:57
really going to help to deliver this maximum  performance and efficiency. And you know what?  
11:02
Who knows? But at this pace, probably  not in 2026, but I think further out,  
11:07
you might see DNA computing entering into the  mix. Well, those are some lofty goals. And look,  
11:13
these are what we think are some of the biggest  AI trends in 2026. But what are we missing?  
11:21
