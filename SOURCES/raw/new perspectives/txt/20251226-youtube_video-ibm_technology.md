# AI Trends 2026: Quantum, Agentic AI & Smarter Automation

What will be the most important trends in AI in 2026? We take a stab at this every year with some success. This time, I have the knowledgeable assistance of my colleague, Aaron Baughman, to help us out. After your prediction of infinite memory last year, I thought maybe you could use a little help. That's fair. How about we each take four trends each?

## Multi-Agent Orchestration

My number one trend of 2026 is multi-agent orchestration. Last year we said 2025 was the year of the agent—AI agents that can reason and plan and take action on a task. Agents delivered. There are numerous agentic platforms for tasks like coding and basic computer use, but no single agent really excels at everything.

What if you had a whole team of agents working together? You might have an agent that acts as a planner, decomposing goals into steps. You'd have worker agents that do different steps—one specializes in writing code, others call APIs and so forth. Then perhaps you have a critic agent that evaluates outputs and flags issues. These agents collaborate under a coordinating layer: the orchestrator.

Multi-agent setups like this help introduce cross-checking where one agent checks the other agent's work, and they can break problems into more discrete verifiable steps.

## Digital Labor Workforce

The second trend is the digital labor workforce. These are digital workers—autonomous agents that can parse a task by interpreting multimodal input. After preparation, the worker executes what's called a workflow. At the end of an action plan, it follows a sequence of steps integrated into some system that can take action through downstream components.

These systems are further enhanced by human-in-the-loop AI, which provides oversight, correction, and strategic guidance—rails to ensure that all of these agents are doing what they're supposed to be doing. This overall trend will create a force-multiplying effect to extend human capability.

## Physical AI

Trend number three is physical AI. Large language models generate text. There are plenty of diffusion image models that generate pixels and images. These are all operating in digital space.

Physical AI is about models that understand and interact with the world we live in—the real 3D world. This is about models that can perceive their environment, reason about physics, and take physical action like robotics. Previously, getting a robot to do something useful meant programming explicit rules. If you see an obstacle, you should turn left, for example. It was all done by humans coding these rules.

Physical AI flips that around. You train models in simulation that simulate the real world, and they learn to understand how objects behave in the physical world, how gravity works, how to grasp something without crushing it. These models are sometimes called world foundation models—generative models that can create and understand 3D environments. They can predict what happens next in a physical scene.

In 2026, many of these world models are taking humanoid robots from research to commercial production. Physical AI is scaling.

## Social Computing

Number four is about social computing. This is a world where many agents and humans operate within a shared AI fabric. Say you have an agent here and a human there. They're connected through this fabric, and when information flows between the two, they begin to understand each other and gather what the intent is going to be. Once they have the intent and information, they have actions—they can affect each other or maybe even the environment they're in.

All of this flows seamlessly across this system. It's a shared space that enables collaboration, context exchange, and effective understanding. The outcome is an empathetic emergent network of interactions—what we call collective intelligence or real-world swarm computing. Teams of agents, digital labor, humanoid robots, and technology that can understand me through affective computing. 2026 could be quite the year, and we're only halfway through the trends.

## Verifiable AI

Trend number five is verifiable AI. The EU AI Act is coming, and by mid-2026 it becomes fully applicable. Think of this a little like GDPR but for artificial intelligence. The core idea is that AI systems, especially high-risk ones, need to be auditable and traceable.

What does that mean? It means documentation. If you're building high-risk AI, you need technical documentation that demonstrates compliance—how you tested the models and the risks you identified. It means transparency. Users need to know when they're interacting with a machine. Things like synthetic text need to be clearly labeled. And it means data lineage. You need to be able to summarize where your training data came from and prove you respected copyright opt-outs.

Just like how GDPR has shaped global privacy, not just for folks in the EU, the EU AI Act will probably set the template for AI governance worldwide.

## Quantum Utility Everywhere

Trend number six really changes everything, but it also changes nothing at the same time. This is where we put in quantum utility everywhere. 2026 is where we start to see quantum computing reliably solving real-world problems better, faster, or more efficiently than classical computing methods.

At this point, we have quantum utility at scale—systems that begin working alongside and together with classical infrastructure to deliver practical value in everyday workflows. This is going to help with optimization, simulation, and decision-making. All three of these tasks were previously out of reach within the classical realm. But this hybrid quantum-classical era will begin to transform quantum computing into a mainstream paradigm as it's woven into our everyday business operations.

## Reasoning at the Edge

My trend number seven is reasoning at the edge. Last year, we talked about very small models—models with just a few billion parameters that don't need huge data centers to run. They work on your laptop or maybe even your phone.

In 2026, those small models are learning to think. If we think about the best models we have today, the frontier models, pretty much all of them now use something called inference time compute. They spend extra time thinking before giving you an answer, working through problems step by step. The trade-off is they need more compute.

But here's what's changing. Teams have figured out how they can distill all of this reasoning information into smaller models. Now these smaller models can perform thinking as well. You're taking massive reasoning models that generate tons of step-by-step solutions and using that data to train the smaller models to reason the same way. That's resulting in reasoning models with only a few billion parameters. They work offline. Your data never leaves your device. And there's no round-trip latency to a data center.

For anything that's real-time or mission-critical, having a model that can actually reason through a problem locally is a pretty big deal.

## Amorphous Hybrid Computing

Our last and final trend is number eight: amorphous hybrid computing. This is a future where both AI model topologies and cloud infrastructure blend into what's called a fluid computing backbone.

AI models are shifting beyond just this pure transformer design. They're beginning to evolve into other architectures that integrate transformers with what we call state space models. In 2026, you're also going to see different emerging algorithms that combine both the state space and transformers and other elements together. That's going to be really fun to watch—very artful.

At the same time, cloud computing is becoming fully differentiated by combining many different chip types. We're going to have CPUs, GPUs, TPUs. And finally, what we just talked about in trend six—quantum—we're going to have QPUs. I should also mention that you'll see neuromorphic chips coming out that emulate the brain.

All of these are going to be put together into a unified compute environment where parts of each of these types of models are automatically mapped to the optimal compute substrate. This is really going to help deliver maximum performance and efficiency. Who knows? At this pace, probably not in 2026 but further out, you might see DNA computing entering into the mix.

Those are some lofty goals, and these are what we think are some of the biggest AI trends in 2026.
