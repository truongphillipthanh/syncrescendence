# AI's Industrial, Financial, and Enterprise Transformations in 2026

## The Electro-Industrial Stack

My name is Ryan McEntush. I'm an investing partner on the American Dynamism team. My big idea for 2026 is that the electro-industrial stack will move the world. The next industrial evolution won't just happen in factories, but inside the machines that power them. This is the rise of the electro-industrial stack: combined technology that powers electric vehicles, drones, data centers, and all of modern manufacturing.

There are common tropes people report on. People talk about China being so far ahead that we can't catch up. Actually, if you go back a couple years ago, people were saying China was very far behind and America was incredibly fast. We've seen a whiplash, and now it's the opposite. I think the reality is that the technology China has, America can do. We're very good at engineering. We're very good at doing specific things. Even recent developments around rare earth—rare earth separation and processing—we know how to do this. We can do this. We can do it incredibly fast.

The real challenge is building the ecosystem to do this industrially at scale and doing it at low cost. Another example people typically talk about is companies like SpaceX or Anduril[^1]—large businesses that need to move incredibly fast and thus vertically integrate. In many ways, they're vertically integrating by necessity, not strategy. There just isn't an ecosystem of companies that can scale with them. That is not the case in China. There are tier one, two, three suppliers, components, and raw materials that exist in those ecosystems, as well as the institutions and political bodies that allow them to move incredibly fast. Those are the things that might take years or decades for us to catch up to China. We can do the technology, but everything else needs to grow with it, or else we're just moving the bottleneck.

If you want to build the electro-industrial stack or the core components that feed into these technologies in the United States, you need to blend Silicon Valley software talent and culture with industrial veterans. Even companies like SpaceX were pulling propulsion talent from people who worked on the shuttle program and various old-school contractors. Gwynne Shotwell[^2] came from Aerospace Corporation. There is a world where you need this actual expertise. You need to know what's been tried before. There are smart people out there in these other companies, but you need to be able to move a lot faster. There are many advantages of software today. You need to be able to get the software talent that may not exist in these companies previously.

You also want to collocate engineering and manufacturing. Concepts like design for manufacturing are something that when you're tightly integrated on the same footprint or in the same ecosystem, you can move a lot faster. I think you also need to build prestige around the mission. For traditional Silicon Valley talent, the smartest people can work on a number of problems, and there are many problems worthy of working on. Some of them pay more than others. You need to attach a prestige or a purpose to what you're working on and use that to attract top talent.

The way that software will affect the physical world is through these embodied, electrified components. It's not just a humanoid robot or an electric vehicle, but the batteries, the power electronics, the compute, the motors. All these things we're going to need to either reshore or vertically integrate within the companies who are building the end product. These are very technical. These require a lot of expertise. These are very difficult problems to solve. But the companies who solve it and the countries who have the talent base to support it are the ones who are going to win in the 21st century. As software and artificial intelligence get stronger and they start having more of a presence in automation and industrial military applications, owning these supply chains is going to become even more important.

## The Turning Point in Financial Services

I'm Angela Strange, general partner on the Fintech team. My big idea for 2026 is that we are at a turning point in financial services and insurance, an industry that's long resisted modernization. This feels like the moment right before SaaS when we had massive on-prem installations in every industry. For those who don't live in financial services and insurance, you might not realize that the vast majority of banks and insurance companies in the United States are on platforms that are decades old and not built for the modern world. The promise of the last decade was we'd layer AI on top of them, but if the underlying infrastructure isn't in place to take advantage of AI, it just won't work.

After talking to hundreds of banks and insurance companies, these platforms are at the end of their lifespans. It's painful to operate. It's painful to try to integrate. It's really painful to innovate on top of. There are few AI-enabled processes that you can add given the limitations of what these platforms can take. That's why we're starting to see the rise of AI-native software platforms for financial services and insurance, platforms that have been rearchitected with AI at the center to unify previously siloed data. If you can do that and layer AI on top, you can start to parallelize processes and, in many cases, automate parts of your business that before weren't possible.

If you're a financial services company and you're successful in adopting one of these new platforms, not only do we think you can have much better margins, but you can start expanding the total addressable market. Some products today in financial services have a whole host of manual processes. Insurance companies often don't even touch certain products, whether it's commercial lines or home insurance, because they can't economically underwrite them without having 10x the margin to pay for all the people that you need to process them. This is going to create entire new categories that people haven't been able to address before.

We're going to see 10x winners and 10x losers. The winners are going to figure out how to adopt these new platforms faster, getting the margin upside, getting the ability to expand into new categories, getting the reputation of being forward-thinking, innovative. The losers will be stuck on their old platforms. They won't have access to this margin upside. They won't be able to expand into new markets. They won't be able to compete with the companies that are able to do this.

Why now? Primarily three reasons. One, we have to remember that many of these companies still live on mainframes—decades-old mainframes—and their systems were already on the verge of breaking with the scale. Two, now companies see that they're leaving a lot of revenue on the table by not being able to take advantage of AI. For instance, in insurance, underwriters sometimes can't even get to the demand that they have because they're not able to process it fast enough. They can't bring in the documents. They can't scan them. This is a huge revenue upside that can be captured if you get the right system and layer AI on top.

Third, there are strong, viable options of this next generation of AI-first software built by entrepreneurs who deeply understand your industry, are deeply technical, and have entirely rearchitected your platforms to enable you to scale and be incredibly flexible in terms of how you can add AI now and in the future.

I see a ton of opportunity here and potentially a dramatic reordering of the winners and losers of incumbent companies based on who becomes the early adopters of some of these new platforms. We're already seeing it. There are some banks and some insurance companies that are starting to get the reputation of being forward-thinking, easier to work with, wanting to lean in. Those companies in some areas like mortgage servicing have been able to turn areas of their business from 5% margin businesses to 50% margin businesses. Imagine doing that across your company as quickly as possible. It's going to make a much bigger difference against your competitor that maybe takes two or three years to catch up.

One of the reasons as an investor that I get so excited about infrastructure is that it's beautiful infrastructure that enables beautiful consumer experiences and beautiful business experiences. For instance, why does your bank market products to you that you already have? It's because your customer data sits in all of these different silos. Why can't customer service agent A answer questions about product B if you call in about your banking operations?

Now, imagine the future of a unified data layer and incredibly smart people supplemented by agents that can understand your needs, help you with any product you already have, anticipate your needs in the future. That would be a beautiful experience for both customers and businesses. In 2026, we're going to see a dramatic acceleration for any company that has built a new AI-first platform that sells into this large industry. But the opportunity is massive. If you are a founder who deeply understands or is deeply curious about any archaic aspect of banking or insurance, the opportunity is now. You can build your software faster and customers are ready to buy.

## The Dynamic Agent Layer

I'm Sarah Wang, general partner on a16z Growth, and my big idea for 2026 is that systems of record start to lose their edge. A passive system-of-record layer stops making sense when agents can independently execute on unsigned intent. I expect to see a new dynamic agent layer that actually makes sense for employees to replace legacy systems of record. This is a very exciting development on the long road of inserting intelligence into companies.

I don't say that systems of record are losing primacy lightly at all. I used to work at a firm that almost exclusively invested in ERPs and other systems of record because of the stickiness of the data gravity. There was a wave of SaaS 2.0 that was well-funded and tried and failed to take on the system of record, mostly through a better UI. This is the first time that we've seen a genuine threat to that, and that's because the distance between intent and execution is collapsing. That's creating not a 20% to 50% better experience for the user, but how you get to that magical 10x.

Let's take the concrete example of ITSM—IT service management. This has traditionally been the domain of powerhouse company ServiceNow[^3]. I chatted with a head of IT recently who told me for the first time in his two-decade-long career, he believed that IT support was fundamentally going to change. It will look completely different in five years. Why is that?

If you think about the way that the old systems work, how long it takes to do something like request access to new software in the firm, and you contrast that with the ITSM agents that are arriving—they plug into your stack and this type of request becomes nearly instantaneous. Through advancements in LLMs, you can now extract intent. You can classify the request type. You can map it to a known workflow, identify user entities, and the request from the user becomes fulfilled in a way that is efficient and accurate.

We think there are a couple of valuable layers in this new paradigm. Of course, there's the foundation model layer. We believe that stays valuable. But it's really the emerging agent layer that sits as close as possible to the user and is collecting data on that user, understanding user preferences, that we think accrues value in the future.

Based on everything that we're seeing in the wild, we believe this is a huge opportunity for new players to come in and win. Why is that? We're in a phase right now where the product is getting better on a weekly, if not daily, basis, and you need teams that move fast. If you're going to collapse intent and execution, what bridges that is actually having an accurate or reliable solution for your customer. Otherwise, they're not going to use it. They're not going to trust the agent that you're building.

That's why we're starting to see even agents built on top of classic, iconic platforms like Datadog[^4] lose to some of the new AI SRE companies like Resolve or Traversal. We're extremely excited about this opportunity, and 2026 is going to be the year that the dynamic agent layer overtakes the system of record.
