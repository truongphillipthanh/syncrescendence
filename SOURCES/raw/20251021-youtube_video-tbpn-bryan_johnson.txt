We are the first generation who won't die. It's less about living forever. It's more about a philosophy of yes,
0:06
this moment is big. What a lot of people don't realize is this endeavor is entirely about AI alignment. Now AI is a
0:11
tool like we feel more productive with it. Yes. At what point will do everything so well you feel this deep hole in your stomach
0:18
of like what do I do? We have Brian Johnson. Welcome to the
0:25
stream. Go over there. Uh while he hops on, let me tell you about AI. Google
0:30
Google AI Studio, the fastest way from promp to production with Gemini, chat with models, vibe code, and monitor
0:35
usage. Thank you. Uh classic LA story. Good to see you again. People in LA arrive on time 15 minutes
0:44
after you normally arrive. Oh, yeah. At least I do normally. Yeah, that's the nature.
0:50
Uh hopefully you didn't have too much traffic. It's great to have you here. Uh big week for you. It's been a great week for us.
0:56
Yeah, congratulations. uh 60 million but break down exactly what happened what what was the impetus for the deal uh
1:03
take us through the recent history of blueprint I mean I started this this is the idea that you know we are the first generation who won't die
1:09
it's kind of a crazy idea we started this a couple years ago and I think a lot of people thought this was kind of an insane
1:14
pro thought process and so we've been hammering away and I think it's gone from weird to interesting to yesterday
1:20
was kind of like now it's accepted and maybe even cool. Yeah. Yeah. And so I think we've it's a it's a thing
1:26
now. It's a part of the zeitgeist and I think it formalizes that we're really going to take a a shot at this. Yeah. So, I mean there's like the
1:33
philosophical underpinning where you're I imagine you know in in the vein of Kerszswall like looking at long-term
1:40
trends artificial intelligence uh compounding just the value of compounding little
1:45
gains all over the the health system potentially could at least in your
1:51
belief get us to infinite life and not die. Don't die. So you get to that but
1:56
then you you know at some point need to instantiate that in a company in a business in a suite of products and so
2:02
that's what blueprint is today. Is that the idea of of the the fund raise is that what people are investing in?
2:08
Yeah the idea is um when somebody says yes I want to be healthy it's pretty hard you have to go
2:15
out and you have to navigate a thousand things you know like is this good for me or is it bad for me? You have people who
2:20
have conflicting opinions and so our target customer is somebody who says I want to be healthy. and we
2:25
just say, "We've got you." Yeah. We will give you like the protein amounts. We'll give you tested and certified foods. We'll give you the
2:31
exact dose. We'll help you with your prescriptions. We'll give you protocols. Like your autonomous self, like it's not go
2:37
navigate the world by yourself. It's we've got you. Yeah. And we'll do an evidence-based biomarker approach. One of the uh I feel like
2:44
anybody that really gets into health goes through a period where they realize I I at least at one point I was like 19
2:50
at the time realized that it felt like I was spending like 50% of all my
2:55
cognitive power on just like trying to be as healthy as possible. And at a certain point I realized like this is
3:01
such an inefficient use of time. Fortunately, you build up some habits and kind of like understanding of what's
3:07
good and what's bad and what you want to uh leverage more and and kind of avoid and all that stuff, but uh I think like
3:15
make you know removing that uh step from the process of being able to just kind of like default into a system. Um, walk
3:22
can can you get into a little bit more of like I I I remember reading a post at this point from you maybe it was like a
3:28
couple months ago kind of like talking through the decision- making around um you know where you wanted to take
3:34
blueprint uh why kind of raise capital all that kind of thing. Yeah. I mean it was this um I mean I
3:42
guess I my sole objective is try to be sober in this moment and I really enjoy the perspective of thinking a few
3:48
hundred years into the future. You look back at this moment and we are giving birth to some kind of super
3:54
intelligence. We don't know what it is. We don't know what kind of scale but it's big. It's important. Uh I have neither an opinion that it's positive or
4:00
negative. It's just significant. And I was really trying to think through does it even matter if I build anything
4:07
in the world right now or should I work on building the philosophy and the moral framework on like what does it mean to
4:12
be intelligent on planet Earth in this part of the galaxy? M and I was kind of in the middle of like as an entrepreneur do you build or like
4:19
which way do you build and so I was just reflecting that am I misallocating my time and I thought you know really
4:26
blueprint is the practical implementation of this philosophy like when you say yes to don't die you're
4:32
saying I value existence I respect existence and so it's it's less about living forever it's more about a
4:38
philosophy of yes this moment is big and so what a lot of people don't realize is this endeavor is entirely about AI
4:45
alignment. Yeah. I mean that's the sole thing happening on the planet right now. And so when you
4:50
take care of yourself, you take care of your body, when you take care of the body, you take care of intelligence, like it's like it's this holistic system
4:55
of we acknowledge existence. So it's that was it. It was like I was trying to figure out as a human, what do I do on
5:01
planet Earth right now and how do I spend my time? I'm an entrepreneur. My intuitions are to become an entrepreneur, but I wondered is that
5:06
really the the right way to do it? Yeah. Yeah. What is what does Blueprint look like in a decade? It feels like you're
5:14
it's such a unique consumer package goods business because you can't even call it that. It's like I mean I I
5:20
understand that there's like the philosophy and I I love that as the brand but even just in terms of like the business of like what people pay for
5:26
there's a lot and that's just that just such a contrarian approach to this this
5:33
category because so many people are like I have an idea I'm going to make coffee better. I'm going to make a greens
5:38
powder better or I have an opinion about the the burger or the meat or the food
5:44
or one particular thing and then they grow and grow and grow and then 5 years in they're like let's do a line extension. Let's do
5:49
Yeah. The CPG trend of the last 10 years was go walk into the gas station, find a product that's popular and make a a
5:56
version of it that's like 50% healthier and then you probably have like a nine figure revenue business or make nothing like Thrive Market,
6:04
Arowan. There's a bunch of companies that have been like we're just be the the seller of everything. How did you
6:10
land on like I want to kind of make everything that feels like an immense challenge. Yeah. I want to walk through
6:15
all that. I mean that's what you know Kaparthi was talking about the autonomous systems with Door Cache. Yeah. Like that then
6:20
and he and I think very similar in this way is that if you model out what AI systems will do, they'll probably take
6:26
on more autonomous responsibility in our lives. We see beginnings where you plug an address in to a car and it helps you
6:32
navigate to the place. You don't think about it much. Yep. We're going to build our autonomous self. Our health will be run on our
6:37
behalf. So right now we have to chase down all our food. We have to chase down protocols. We have to chase down evidence. But it's not going to be that
6:43
in the future. It will be that it will just be run for us and as we get measurement that's more high fidelity. So blueprint is basically we're saying
6:50
we are going to build your autonomous system of health and we're going to ride the breakthroughs of science so that as
6:56
we make better progress in lowering the speed of aging and reversing aging damage, you can just say I'm in and I'm
7:03
going to ride with you. We're going to try to be on the very very forefront to help people have, you know, the best
7:09
possible health. So we're just building out autonomous health systems. Yeah, that feels like super valuable just from
7:15
the consumer experience of like I I'm I'm delegating all of that hassle. I
7:21
know basically if I buy one from one brand, it it's all aligned with one philosophy, which is great. Um what does
7:28
that mean on the logistics side? What does that mean on the capex side? What does that mean on the operational cost side? Do you have like 25 different
7:35
product managers for each niche? Like what's the shape of the company? This feels like a big challenge. A very big challenge. were standing up
7:41
like 10 different businesses at the same time. Exactly. Like there's plenty of people that could have done what you did where
7:47
they like become famous or they become content creators in one way or another and then they're like now I have one
7:53
product and you're like now I have how many products do you actually have? Over 20. Over 20. Yeah. Uh and it's clear that
7:59
like you probably a lot of that comes from the fact that you've been a successful entrepreneur before. You're
8:04
like yeah I can probably do more than just one. But uh but what what what actually does the what does the does the
8:09
business look like? Does the system look like? Are there cross-selling benefits in retail on day one or is this just an
8:16
e-commerce play on day one? Like, how do you think about the the costs and benefits of going multi-product so soon?
8:22
Yeah. I mean, the thing is that when people want to be healthy, you can't just address one thing. They're still left with 99 things to deal with.
8:28
I totally get the consumer value makes a ton of sense. So, internally, we're basically building out the infrastructure to deliver every
8:34
single channel. So digital food, uh, prescriptions, testing, so we could say
8:40
like so much stuff. It is so much stuff, you know, like this is what so I've done this myself for the past, you know, like 5 years. We've
8:46
mastered the system for me and, you know, I've been fighting to achieve the best biomarkers in the world. Kind of in some sense a like a
8:53
ridiculous idea, but also like it's a new sport. Like you can imagine it becoming a thing. Um, so yeah, I mean
8:58
basically we've mastered it, we've built it, now we're just productizing. So yeah, people do. So where are the images of the What is
9:05
how do you think about so so every every consumer out there has probably at some point or another gone through the
9:12
frustration of of finding a product they love and then watching the company
9:17
behind it or sometimes an acquire just like steadily just like try to maintain or increase their margins to the point
9:23
where it's no longer that it might have similar looking packaging but it's no longer the same product like like I
9:30
imagine like you want blueprint to be the thing that you are relying on for the majority of your calories, the
9:36
majority of the supplements you take, the majority of the drugs that you are going to uh leverage. And so uh I can
9:44
imagine like you know holding the company to that standard so that you're not having to go anywhere else or
9:50
realize like oh this product would actually be better for me. But like do you have any kind of like ethos around that? because that just feels like
9:56
every, you know, I try to be cognizant of like when a company goes from founder
10:03
to uh they've exited and the new acquirer is just going to say like, hey, you know, we could actually source this
10:09
salt from over here and we're going to save like 80% and nobody's really going
10:14
to notice cuz it's going to taste similar. But then the tests start showing up and it's actually like got lead in it now or whatever.
10:20
Yeah, exactly. Right. I mean, I'm Blueprint's number one customer. I appreciate it so much, you know, because
10:25
like we when we first started doing this project, I was testing everything I put into my body. Air, water, food, like
10:32
everything. And I learned first of all, food is guilty until proven innocent. Like it is so toxic. It's no matter
10:39
where you get it. Yeah. People were freaking out last week when there was that uh protein powder report came out that a bunch of them had
10:44
lead in it. And I was like I my immediate reaction was like obviously a lot of this stuff has lead in it. I mean
10:51
like look at the average chocolate bar has like a ton of lead in it and that's it's not even so you can to
10:56
isolate that one toxin but there's so many other toxin. So people they they grab onto one concept that they
11:03
understand it's like oh that's bad. There's trace levels of heavy metals in all of our foods. Yeah. So like the fact that it's there is not
11:08
unarming. It's just it's out of context but it's at a level people understand. But you know the goal is I'm going to
11:14
blueprint is my way to try to achieve you know this don't die and so people will be just riding along. We build on
11:21
population level data. So this is not about Brian Johnson's body. This is about everybody's body. So all ages, both genders. But no, I think we're
11:27
being meticulous about what we do. And so it will be the quality will be the best in the world. And so I care
11:33
about it. I'm consuming all about myself. Yeah. what what uh what's the plans on the kind of tele medicine front for uh
11:41
for uh kind of interventions or therapies that require uh doctors kind
11:47
of involvement. Is there anything on that front? We will build an infrastructure to basically when you want a prescription if you want to go on a GLP1 we can help
11:53
you get started whether you want a large dose or micro dose. You're just like, "Yeah, and also I'll
12:00
do the lab testing and also like build the, you know, the I'll I'll I'll be mining the metal that gets turned into
12:06
the needle that injects you with the like you want to hold up the entire global economy." I love it. It's good
12:12
ambition. I I I I strongly support this. Uh yeah, I I was interested in like like
12:18
where are the edges of like what you'd be like, "Yeah, actually I'm not going to go into that market." But it feels
12:23
like you'll just continue to work on it until you get to some status where you're like, "Yeah, actually it's would
12:30
you would you go into hospitality? Would you create like physical kind of like if
12:35
you want if you want to get 100% European these European kind of uh health retreats that are very like
12:42
evidence- driven and they're testing focus I could imagine a blueprint retreat center that that people can
12:48
visit once a year to we have about a dozen groups around the world that want to stand this up and some of the biggest hotel chains around
12:54
the world they because the thing is they just want credibility they want to say like come here we have this thing structured when I meet with some of the
13:00
most powerful people in the They're just as clueless as everyone else. It is not a like people imagine
13:06
rich and powerful people just have it solved. That is not the case. And so yeah, we are going to stand this up. We probably will not do physical
13:13
clinics. It's just too much on the real estate. And so we'll probably license it out. Sure. We probably do the digital model. We
13:19
have model. We have trust like we want to have like we could do a model across food and
13:25
clinics where we have this evidence-based approach. So yeah, I mean we're we're kind of in it to just
13:30
blanket the entire industry with a framework on how to do things in a credible way that's biomarkerled,
13:36
evidence-based. Yeah. Uh what was the thesis behind the round? $60 million, tons of faces, not
13:43
the traditional CPG VCs, private equity folks, like what was the thesis?
13:48
Yeah. I mean, so I I've been funding the company myself up until this point. Yeah. And you know, I guess I just
13:55
wanted my friends to come along with me. The So these are people I talk to in private. They enjoy it. They're into it.
14:01
And I think a lot of people, they have not known how to think about me. Like, am I legit? Am I not? Is this a thing?
14:06
Is this weird? And then they see that list of investors are like, "Oh shit." And so like yesterday, I think was the
14:12
first day it was like, "Oh, it's safe to say this is cool." Whereas before that flipped like a long time ago.
14:19
Yeah. I I I feel like the I feel like that the first like business I What was the first piece that you did that was
14:25
like I spent $2 million on my health and that went super viral. Yeah. Yeah. Two or three years ago.
14:30
That was like two or three years ago. I feel like that was the moment where people my personal view pretty quickly
14:35
people dug into your backtory and were like, "Oh yeah, you sold a movie." Yeah. My personal view is is America has
14:41
has over the last few years had so little trust in health institutions.
14:47
like if you just went and followed the American Heart Association's guidance, I'd probably die at like 60, right? And
14:54
so, so to me, I was always like, you know, knowing how much I I you can read
15:00
about health and you can listen to podcasts and you can listen to what some influencer said in a short form video,
15:06
but to deeply understand your health, you have to do self-experimentation. Everybody is different. And so I always
15:12
looked at it, you know, you you always tried to be controversial enough to like
15:18
generate attention, attract some people that were going to become super fans and lose some people and you were kind of
15:24
okay with that. But my my sense was always like, thank you that somebody is going to invest more money than
15:29
basically anyone else and just self-experimentation and then open source all of that and now people can
15:35
buy your olive oil if they want or they can decide no, I'm actually going to go on my own journey and try to find some
15:41
uh some product that can fit this requirement. Um, but it felt like such a public benefit that I always wish there
15:48
was like a thousand Brian Johnson's that were just all running the same experimentation open sourcing process
15:55
versus the biggest thing we we talked about this the other day is health influencers quickly get into
16:01
put themselves in a niche and they're like I'm the I'm the the fasting guy.
16:06
I'm the HRV guy. And then every single thing becomes about that. Yeah. And it's cool because you can like
16:11
tap into a world and like kind of accelerate and understand a lot about a category, but then in reality it's not
16:18
like fasting is the only thing that matters. It's just like one tool. So I have another take on on that that
16:25
maybe I'd like your reaction to. Uh there's also this this trend in health
16:31
influence where if I want to blow everyone's brain, I'm going to come in and uh blow everyone's mind. I'll be
16:37
like, "Guess what? I boil it all down. It's uh sleep, diet, and exercise. That's like 99% of what you need to do.
16:43
And everyone's like, "Man, this John Guy, he's not talking about the crazy supplements. He's just telling it like it is. Sleep, diet, exercise. I did it.
16:49
I feel great. This is amazing." And then after I've made, you know, one hour of
16:54
content every week for 5 years on sleep, diet, exercise. I'm like, "You know what? Let's actually talk about like the
17:00
17th piece of magnesium you should take or like that the thing that's Yeah, it is beneficial, but it's 0.001% Oh, 1%.
17:08
And and it's still interesting, but it's not going to have the power law effect of like actually start working out or
17:14
like actually get sleep. And so, do you wrestle with that? Do you feel like you have to go back to the basics sometimes
17:20
or or do you think that there's there's actually maybe that's not even that's not even a reasonable critique?
17:25
Yeah. I think that the the thing that most people struggle with is doing things they don't want to do.
17:31
Like they don't want to overeat. They don't want to eat a pint of ice cream. like they don't want to drink, you know, you know. So,
17:38
yeah, those things are really the highest leverage interventions. It's it's behav
17:43
it's behavioral. Yeah. And so, yes, you can say sleep that exercise, but you get deep and you then uncover that American like our American
17:50
society is one of addiction. Sure. Like the American powers of capitalism have pointed at getting people to be
17:56
addicted on food, right? Sugar, nicotine, porn, junk food, like all of it. And so this is like if
18:02
you look at so like just from a broad perspective you begin on western thought with political Aristotle Christianity
18:09
medieval times renaissance uh enlightenment and modern scientific era. Yeah. Like you look at these big frames we're
18:15
due for a major shift and right now we're at the tail end. This is like kind of a dio kind of thought process of like
18:21
these big macro trends. Yeah. We're at the end and right now you know capitalism was for solving scarcity.
18:27
We're now compulsive. Right. We're now compulsive. Yeah. And the idea was democracy was freedom of choice. We now have no longer choice
18:34
because we're addicted. So we're really playing on this very big macro frame of we're at different time
18:39
as a species. And so yes, sleep that exercise, but in this larger frame, it's about what does it mean to actually
18:46
be intelligent, make decisions, and you can't when you're addicted to everything. Yeah. What what do you think about some of the longer tale interventions like
18:52
the the the like the third peptide that's not approved yet, but people are
18:58
already taking it here? It feels like is this sort of like unsegulated
19:04
unregulated biohacking becoming more prevalent? Is that the correct world in a world where the FDA is broken or does
19:10
the FDA need to change or how how do how should we like map the you know
19:16
accelerating advances in science with maybe stagnation in regulatory? What's
19:22
your framework for that? Yeah, I mean peptides are very powerful. They're basically drugs. Okay, right. So you get access to drug-like effect sizes. The problem is peptides are often
19:29
times not manufactured to spec and so you have risks like putting stuff in your body that you shouldn't be put in your body
19:36
like they could have lead in them just like your chocolate bar and a bunch of other stuff. Same with stem cells. So like there's there's a real quality problem.
19:42
The other problem is peptides a lot of peptides are not fully well characterized. So typically drugs you say like you can do this thing but also
19:48
here's the long list of side effects. Yeah. And that's nice because it's like okay at least I know what the trade-off space is. With these peptides you don't
19:55
have the characterization. Okay. And so it's a bigger risk that people experiment. You see a lot of this in bodybuilding now. You have bioarker bio
20:01
hackers doing it. So it's fine. It's just you have to understand it's the wild wild west. That may be your game.
20:08
It may not. But like it's definitely you want to be cautious. It's not like a safe path. But then there's other things like
20:13
you start with the highest level of evidence. You know sauna is great. Yeah. But you know like if you I've talked about this a lot. If you don't ice the
20:20
boys in the sauna you crush. Can you make a ice pack? I used to I used to I think we maybe talked about
20:25
this last time. I used to there used to be this ice pack on Amazon that was for this use case and they stopped selling
20:31
it and now I don't I I like I lost I lost my Yeah. They don't want you icing your boys out there. I don't think they want
20:36
that. Yeah. And then a lot of men will say like I'm not trying to have you know babies so it doesn't matter but has negative feedback
20:42
hormone hormone health. Exactly. Interesting. So yeah there so yes sleep that exercise is great but then you dive into the
20:48
details. This is what I'm saying. Like you you start down this path and you inevitably will spend 50% of your time
20:54
chasing down everything some sort of weird root cause on whatever it is. It's never easy. So you have infinite
21:01
chase. And that's what I'm saying is that's the problem I'm trying to solve is nobody has 50% of their time to do this.
21:06
How uh how how are you thinking about wearables? Because there's a world in the future where you have a camera
21:11
that's effectively a sensor that's able to experience life in your in your view. And that as like a health co-pilot would
21:17
be pretty wild because you be like, "Hey, hey, you you've already eaten like, you know, well beyond you assume
21:24
that like cameras get better at like calorie tracking. It's like, hey, you're well over like uh your daily caloric
21:29
needs. Like you're now going into a surplus. Maybe ease off and maybe that's enough." Meta Rayban displays like need a killer
21:35
app. That sounds like something you should build. What do you Yeah. I mean the if you think about it GLP1s are kind
21:40
of that I mean a little bit right it's like it's like modulating your hunger your satiety and it's like so
21:47
how do you how do you think uh we'll view GLP1s and the the explosion of
21:52
their use in 50 years. It's probably the most successful anti-aging drug ever built.
21:58
It's incredible. Yeah. It's like you the benefits keep on accumulating. Yes, there's drawbacks. They're getting better all the time. But
22:03
you feel the same way about statins? Uh those are they're complicated. I mean, statins do have benefits, but they're complicated.
22:09
Um, do you feel like there's any value to reading into the uh the the
22:15
conspiracy uh like weird vibes around the fact that like Ozmpic came from a demon like this
22:22
Hila monster? Isn't that what it is? He monster. Is it the Hila monster komodo dragon
22:27
venom or something like that? Like it just feels like wrong, right? If you're just like, you know, just humanity 101,
22:33
he'd be like, "Yeah, don't drink. Don't become the reptile. Don't drink the reptile venom." I mean,
22:38
you're you're he Brian might be trying to become the reptile. Are you into it? The Senorian Toad gave us 5 MO DMT.
22:45
And I would say that that's bad, too. That that throwed off all sorts of red flags for me. It just got FDA approval. It did. It
22:51
did. Break the status for treat uh depression treat uh resistant depression.
22:56
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Treatment resistant depression. Yeah. Yeah. Got it. Yeah. Uh so yeah, I mean I guess if you're
23:02
sad, you need the CH you need the toad to to cheer you up, I suppose. Happy I'm
23:08
I'm happy if it's helping people. I'm happy. Uh it is it is just funny when we were we we we were looking at the story
23:13
of Ozmpic like a year ago. What's your what's your view on uh I think everybody's hoping maybe maybe GLP ones
23:20
are this and and people haven't sort of fully realized it yet, but everybody is kind of I feel like for a while just
23:26
hoping that like oh by the time that I'm I'm a I'm really aging like I'm really feeling it uh there will just be a pill
23:33
that I can take and you know I'll just be able to halt or maybe even reverse. Are you like how open to to you how open
23:43
are you to the idea that like there could be something that is like an order of magnitude more effective than GLP-1s
23:49
in terms of anti-aging? Like are you you know where where do you put the probability there? I mean that study that came out in from
23:56
China in June they showed that they took this form of a FOX3 protein they used
24:01
crisper they put it in a messenal stem cell and delivered it via introvenous treatment. It had a a biological
24:07
equivalent for human anti. So this was in monkeys. It had a 3 to five year age reversal in over 50% of the tissues
24:14
which is unseen and for human equivalent that'd be like 9 to 15 years roughly. So
24:19
these demonstrations are being done. I think we'll probably I was going to actually figure this out. You know the the hype cycle where you you um
24:27
Yeah. Gartner hype cycle. Exactly. Yeah. Dissolution plateau productivity. I was going to model this out this week. Try to figure out like
24:33
because I think we're probably going to hit peak in something like GOP ones or something. 2032, you likeish like
24:40
okay, okay, we got some time. We're still going. A few things will hit people like it's here and then oh and people will think that they're
24:46
going to live forever and then there will be a crash and be like oh actually there's still more problems to solve. Exactly. 2035 2037 people like oh man
24:53
like it's not solving this or that or we have these complications and like maybe early 2040s people are like actually we
24:59
got this like something like that I saw some post crazy like inbound from from mad
25:05
scientists all over the world that are like hey I made this thing I was talking with chat GBT for 50 hours over the last
25:12
week and I figured out like let me let me come inject you when I was when I was building kernel with this brain interface I would get
25:18
all these emails that people are like I've been implanted by the government. Oh, right. So, that would come in. But now, yes. Like I do I get I don't know
25:25
maybe like seven to 10 a day. Whoa. People offering you experimental feel like I've I've discovered the
25:31
quantum realm and how the how sick. Yes. It's wild. People are excited about
25:37
this topic. Maybe some toads involved in that one. It's funny. Yeah. I remember seeing this post a while back. I don't know if you
25:43
remember it better than I do, but it was basically looking at like the the distribution of lifespans is not there's
25:51
not just a single power law where everyone falls off at like 90. Like you would expect if it was just a normal
25:57
power law that we would get a couple 150 and like one 200y old person, but in
26:03
fact there are like this double exponential effect. Yeah. And so maybe that's kind of what happens where you
26:09
maybe we solve one of them but then we still are at this like you know exponential fall off in longevity but
26:16
even unlocking like one person at 200 would be amazing. Yeah. There was this interesting paper that came out of Levven uh so he said um
26:23
his theory after running this model was that basically after we reproduce our cells lose purpose like
26:30
we our cells don't have a unifying objective. Yeah. So they just like aging just like we just don't know what to do.
26:36
Interesting. And so if his model is correct like biology needs don't die like they actually need an objective at a macro scale like at
26:43
our level of cognition but also at a cellular level. But I think like these are the kinds of experiments people are being are doing of like what
26:50
what is the underlying incentive structure of biology? Why do we age? Why do we not age in certain parts of our
26:56
life? Why do we have protective mechanisms? You know why do some species regenerate? So, I think it's this really
27:01
exciting frontier where our ideas now of aging are beginning to crack open a little bit and expanding our horizons
27:08
like how do we think about time and I mean we talked about this last time you were on about Warren Buffett,
27:13
Charlie Mer uh not particularly famous for their biohacking but uh incredibly
27:18
resilient uh well like a life well-lived uh so many stories about them like you
27:24
know staying up drinking Coca-Cola and wine long into the night and I I want to believe that there's some level of just
27:30
if you have a purpose, if you have drive, your body just pulls it together
27:36
a little bit more. I I know people want this to be like the answer, you know,
27:41
it's such I think it's really such a bad idea because people in their mind, they make that shortcut and they're like, you know what? I've got I just got to work
27:48
harder. I got to work harder. Yeah. Yeah. Uh did we did we cure uh balding? There was that study was it last week?
27:55
They're all such they're weak effects. Yeah. But you we really have not made I
28:00
guess so long turkey. It's a little bit embarrassing as a human race that we haven't been able to make really good strides on hair loss.
28:07
That one seems very simple. I don't know. It just seems like very mechanical. You know, it it doesn't seem as complicated as like, you know, your
28:14
brain degenerating. We don't even know how the brain works. It's like it's hair. It just grows. Like it's should be easy. We're working on it. We just put out our
28:19
best attempt and we're going to see if it works. Like uh we're going to try to beat every everything that's out there
28:25
on market. Yeah. Yeah. We'll see. How important is uh is like cosmetic
28:30
intervention to the blueprint plan? Like because you could imagine a world where
28:37
people will say, "Yeah, make me live forever, but I don't care about wrinkles and hair because unless it's going to
28:43
help me actually live longer." Yeah. Why bother? I mean, the thing is this don't die is really be hot. Like what? Like what?
28:50
every every every every supplement company, every every company in health, you're ultimately selling at the end of
28:56
the day. I I think this is brilliant from a business perspective, but does it make sense in terms of the science? Like does
29:02
it take something out of Yeah. Like being hot is good science, you know, like if you look youthful and vibrant, your skin is nice and like you
29:09
you're you have a lot of energy. So I think be hot is legit the path for this. Okay. Yeah. Be hot, don't die.
29:15
How do you think about longevity in the business? you know, uh, if you look at, uh, the DTOC bubble, there was a lot of
29:22
companies that raised similar amount of money and and, you know, are are no longer with us. I imagine you care about
29:29
a lot about just making sure that don't die and Blueprint survive decades and I'm sure that's
29:36
informing the way you're building the I mean, this is like you, you know, the internet comes about, Google sets up shop and rides that tailwind. Amazon
29:43
sets up shop on on commerce, right? M basically somebody's going to set up shop in longevity
29:48
and ride a multi- trillion ride. So that's what we're trying to do is we're trying to just be home base, win
29:54
the early innings of longevity and then ride for the multi- trillion dollar market. Yeah. Do you think there's a lot of like
30:00
I imagine M&A will be pretty important to your strategy. There's a lot of companies I mean I just view there's a
30:05
lot of companies that are important that are like single product or for specific use cases that don't really necessarily
30:12
need or shouldn't be because like if you're a blueprint customer maybe you need it once every 3 years
30:19
but that means it could be harder to actually build a business around but it would slot in. You nailed it. So basically if you look
30:24
at the landscape in health right now nothing is proprietary. You basic you got wearables from all
30:29
these different providers you have food from different providers. you have biomarkers like nothing proprietary and so the winner's going to have to out
30:36
compete everybody and bringing a an experience to the customer that is sensible and
30:42
practical and make you know so I think that's that's where the competition is going to be because this is like the days when I was building a braintree
30:47
Venmo is it was commoditized like you're all in the Visa Mastercard MX Discover
30:52
uh stack and you have to build something unique and then uh Brainree and Stripe just collapsed the market.
30:58
Yeah. Uh how do you think about wait I now I want to hear the story of uh of
31:03
the Venmo acquisition. How did that happen? Yeah, they so they built up a vent. So
31:09
people in payments it was very clear PayPal was the only company making money. Okay. Because they had both sides of the
31:15
market. Sure. They got lucky because they got into eBay. They built the consumer side but then they had the merchant side too. Because otherwise if you just offer it
31:21
to merchants your margins are pretty low, right? You're making whatever 20 50 basis points something like that.
31:27
And so everybody was going after PayPal trying to build a two-sided marketplace. And that took a lot of capital. It's
31:32
very hard to build from scratch. And so I said, "Okay, I'm going to build uh the merchant side of the business uh first
31:37
and then I'm going to acquire the consumer side." I said this when I started the company. So we got customers like Airbnb, Uber,
31:43
GitHub. Uh we got all the Gen Z people and then Venmo had done a fantastic job
31:49
building out consumer side and we could then marry those two demographics and it's like
31:54
perfect. And so yeah, so they had built a great business, but they hadn't solved making money. Okay.
31:59
When they plugged into our world, we bought them for 26.2 million. Yeah. Yeah. How much of that was uh like not making
32:06
money because of fraud? I hear that like a lot of fintech companies like they actually have something where the unit economic should work, but it's always
32:14
crazy in the early days. You hear the story about PayPal where PayPal was losing tons of money, but it was only
32:19
because of fraud. the actual business when it wasn't fraudulent made sense. But then once you get to scale, you can
32:24
do the anti- fraud properly. Was that something that you were problem solving around? It's very hard again because you're
32:29
doing peerto-peer and typically you have like like illicit purposes primarily as your driver and so it's a very hard
32:35
problem. So as a standalone, it's hard for them to make sense because you if you have if you stack on a fee when you're paying your buddy, it's hard
32:42
friction in the adoption. So you have to kind of speedrun adoption and then make money later. Yep. But there was no good make money later
32:48
problem. big cash. Do you uh I I was running uh I think it
32:54
was a shower thought. I was like, "Okay, there's so much cap capital slloshing around the private markets. It's been
33:00
interesting that we haven't seen more people like try to take on Stripe. I
33:05
don't know if it's I don't I'd be curious uh from your point of view
33:10
at what point will people even try to climb that mountain?" Very unlikely. They've done such a great
33:16
job executing. I I sold uh Brainree in 2013. So they've been building 12 years since. They've done such a good job
33:23
making that airtight. They're just great. That's this is the thing is like Yeah. You can't come in and make it 10x
33:28
better product. Am Amazon locked commerce. So you of course can build your e-commerce business on Shopify but at a scale. I
33:35
mean Amazon has just kind of owned that entire thing. It's very hard to replicate that. So that's that's our
33:40
goal too is we're basically trying to do that for longevity is once you collapse the entire space it just it's very hard
33:45
to get in. Okay. We got a lightning round. Favorite book? Um or just a book recommendation. Something
33:52
you read recently that you like. Um I just finished uh The History of the
33:58
Western Mind going through all of Western thought. Oh, cool. Uh favorite music? What's in
34:04
your You know, I have such a soft spot for Eminem. When I was when I was depressed, he was the only artist that I I could
34:12
fill. Okay. Love it. Uh, when will humanity
34:17
develop AGI?
34:24
We such are hard. You don't want to sound like a D cell. You don't want to be Yeah.
34:30
Yeah. Um, just call it right now. Yeah, we I want to be able to clip this the day of and be like
34:35
I want to say I want to say that uh I want to say that we'll be nice to you and we won't clip this, but I know our
34:41
clipping infrastructure and we absolutely will clip this. It's such a sucker question.
34:46
Uh well well may maybe let's flip it around. Uh OpenAI and Microsoft did this deal where where the the the definition
34:53
of AGI will be convened by a group of experts. What is your definition of AGI?
35:00
Um I I approach this question as a
35:05
more through psychology of when will humans feel useless
35:11
feel useless. Yes. Like our entire identity is based upon like we do things we contribute we build.
35:16
Yes. And now AI is a tool like we feel more productive with it. Yes. At what point will it do everything so
35:22
well you feel this deep hole in your stomach of like what do I
35:27
do? So, what if Yeah, the weird thing is like computers are incredible at chess,
35:33
yet people play chess for fun and at the professional level because humans, I guess they're anti-clanker and they like
35:39
watching humans play chess. And if we can solve that for everyone so that
35:44
everyone has some sort of even like in this AGI world where there's no more real jobs there's no more actual okay
35:51
you need to produce something for food or you know uh livability everything is
35:56
just for fun or for games and for status and it's all about uh wasn't Andre
36:02
Kopathy saying you go to the gym and you'll learn in the future and it's and I wonder like if your definition is once
36:08
that breaks down That is feels really far. I like that. I like that. Like people look forward to retirement.
36:14
Like retirement is a goal. It's an ideal. It's like we're gonna get an RV. We're going to cruise the country. Then they retire. They're like this sucks.
36:20
Like there's not the tension. So if we imagine we're going to like learn and we're going to like do yoga
36:26
all day and paint and but like if there's not the tension of the stress and the of real life, like do we really
36:33
want to be on vacation all the time? Do we want to be at leisure? So that's my like what I think about is when that
36:38
happens that's a pretty unnerving situation because humans don't do well with that uncertainty and then our
36:45
systems have to respond. So like that's what I really think about all day. Everyone in the end is just going to be competing on biomarkers. It's going to
36:51
be the final it's going to be the final status game. The final game that aligns with Carpathy's take. Uh
36:57
last lightning round question and then I want you to ring the gong. Um favorite vacation spot. Where would you go for
37:04
maybe a trip? Redwood forest. Redwood forest. I love redwood. Staying in California. Yeah, I would love I love redwoods.
37:10
Let's go. Right. Like there. This is John. There's John. I love California. You don't need to go to Europe. I love America. I don't You don't need to get all the radiation
37:16
on the plane. Just stay here. They're like such beautiful, majestic creatures
37:22
and they live a long time. They live a long time. It's very on brand for you. I love it. Uh congratulations on the round. $60
37:27
million. Fantastic progress. I'd love for you to ring that gong and I'd love for you to ring it at a at a decibel
37:34
level that you feel is appropriate for uh hearing. You know, actually, let me Yeah, let me teach us.
37:39
Yeah, let me pull out my decel. Do we have my phone? Let's make sure we get this. Yes, let's bring over We don't want to be over 80 dB.
37:46
Okay. Yes. because we uh we do have IM so it is a little bit of hearing protection but I would love to know uh
37:53
you can you feel free to take as many swings as you as you need but I'd love to know uh what an 80 del uh ring sounds
38:01
like. So yeah I recently I measured my ears my left ear 64 so I have moderate mild to
38:06
moderate hearing loss really which substantially increases your risk of dementia. Oh wow. So yeah so because you're going crazy because you
38:12
don't you don't perceive reality properly. Your brain's missing all these things. Oh, that's our built for for hearing
38:18
loss like concerts, social gatherings, restaurants. So, yeah, I would suggest everyone get a hearing test. I just got
38:25
hearing aids. Okay, so all right. Okay, cool. Here we go. Yeah. Yeah. Hit the hit that gong at at
38:30
a at a longevity approved level. Let's hear it. All right. Okay. What are we at?
38:39
How we doing? 90. 90. Okay. So, about that level. If we go any
38:44
higher, we're going to need Just a tad. Yeah. Yeah. Just a tad.
38:51
There we go. That is the Brian Johnson approve approved hit. You heard it here. I bet I bet everyone
38:57
in the chat is like, "Oh, finally." Because we we smacked that thing so loud. Fortunately, you know, we
39:03
Dude, do you have tonitis? No, I don't. Okay. Fortunately, but I I do. Oh, you do? I've had it since I was uh
39:11
my my Coachella era. This is the thing. Wow. So, yeah. Now, I I don't I don't go to
39:16
concerts at all. I don't pay to stand in crowds and lines. Um but uh but I do I I
39:22
I specifically recall uh or I believe I know the exact weekend that that uh that
39:28
that uh it started. Man, is it a pretty significant thing in your life? Uh no. Oh, I I zone it out. But but if I
39:36
take a if I I like I've adapted to not hearing it. But if I every
39:42
probably few times a week I I'll be in a really quiet space and realize that I have
39:48
constant ringing. Have you looked into hearing aids? No. Yeah. Maybe I should.
39:53
Yeah. So I just got the Ottoon Intense. Yeah. Okay. That that that increases your not
39:59
wearing them right now. Not right now. Yeah. But you you've been testing them out. Yeah. Exactly. I actually I I'm so sad. I I was running out the door and I
40:06
forgot them cuz I just finished my morning routine. So, I'm still sad. But yeah, but they actually they I've only had them for a week. They have substantially improved
40:13
my life. Wow. Yeah. Wow. Cool. Well, this conversation has substantially improved my life
40:19
on the show. This is fantastic. Congratulations.
