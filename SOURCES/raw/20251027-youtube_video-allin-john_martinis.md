**David Friedberg:** Welcome. Today I'm very excited for this All-In interview with this week's Nobel laureate, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2025, John Martinis.[^1] John, welcome to the All-In interview.

**John Martinis:** Thanks for inviting me. I'm quite excited about this talk and love to explain to people what this prize is all about.

## John's History and Early Interest in Physics

**David:** Well, the Nobel Prize is the most prestigious honor, particularly in physics, that can be awarded. You're in the record books. It's going to be an incredible ceremony coming up for you. Maybe we could go back to the beginning in your history. I'd love to hear a little bit about where you grew up and how you got started with your interest in physics.

**John:** I grew up in San Pedro, California. My father was a fireman and my mom stayed at home, took care of us. Through the years I was always interested in science and technology. One of the things is my dad actually didn't have a high school education, but very smart person. He was always building things in the garage, various projects. So I grew up knowing how to build things, which also tells you how things work—this empirical view, tactical view of how physics works.

When I took physics in high school, I actually loved it because there was some math behind it and concepts and it really made sense to me. I just really fell in love with the subject and then went to UC Berkeley and did pretty well there and enjoyed it a lot. In my senior year at UC Berkeley I had a class from John Clarke who was my adviser and found out what he was doing. He was just starting to look at quantum mechanics and electrical devices and it sounded really interesting for me. I guess I could see maybe when something would take off. So I started to do the graduate school work with him.

**David:** You went to Berkeley for graduate school.

**John:** I went to Berkeley for graduate school, which you're not supposed to do.

**David:** I was originally a physics and math undergrad at Cal. I changed my major later and actually got my degree in astrophysics. There was some upper division math class that really turned me off to math as a major. There was just so many proofs. It drove me nuts.

**John:** Right. Physics was always exciting, but I liked working in the astro lab and I worked actually at Lawrence Berkeley Lab.

**David:** But then you stayed at Berkeley and went to grad school, right?

**John:** Yeah, I stayed at Berkeley, went to grad school. We started this project a couple years into grad school. What was interesting is this was a question that was actually posed by professor Anthony Leggett who won the Nobel Prize for helium-3 physics in 2003.[^2]

**David:** That was superfluid helium-3.

**John:** That's right. He showed if you put helium-3 cold enough it kind of almost has this new characteristic with the physics and how it moves and how it works. It has this superfluid behavior, but it has a very complicated behavior because of the more complicated nuclei of the helium-3. This had been discovered and people worked for a while to figure that out. He helped develop the theory for that. So he was quite well-known, very smart person. Although he won the Nobel Prize for that, there's not much helium-3 physics going on. But for the question that led to our experiment, there's a huge field. And the question was: Do macroscopic objects behave quantum mechanically?

This is a macroscopic object might be a small ball. In our case, it's an electrical circuit with billions of electrons in it, billions of atoms, and is the collective motion of the ball quantum mechanical. Now if you think about throwing a ball against the wall, it's going to bounce off. But if you make the wall thin enough and the ball light enough, it'll then every once in a while tunnel through because of the laws of quantum mechanics.

## Explainer on Quantum Mechanics

**David:** Hold on, let's just pause on that for a second. I think that's really worth spending a moment on. So when we talk about quantum mechanics, when we talk about the relative position or energy or movement of a particle at the atomic scale—as small as an atom or smaller than an atom—we have to use probabilities to describe where things are going to be. That was what was really the big understanding of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century, right? That there's the probability of things being where they are and moving as they're moving there. It's not deterministic like we can see with the ball that we throw around. When you get very small, things get very fuzzy and it's very hard.

**John:** You hit upon the key idea here, maybe by accident, but it's very important. Quantum mechanics was developed for the theory of small things—electrons, atoms, things that are the fundamental constituents, but very small. If you take an atom, it's made from an electron and a nucleus. Classically, they attract each other and they would just combine together and then atoms basically would have no size. Why do atoms have size? That was one of the strange things, and it's because this atom is not a point particle. I used to say to my kids that the electrons were fuzzy. Quantum mechanically it has some wave function and extended. You can think of the electrons being all around the nucleus at the same time. So it's just a very strange behavior, but of small things, and of course very important as how atoms work and how we describe nature.

Quantum mechanics ultimately became a field that people say is very non-intuitive in terms of understanding where small particles are, the energy they have, where they're moving to. And we resolved to figuring out that we had to use these functions. It's not just a single point, but it's a distribution. It's a whole bunch of places and there's a probability of where the atom could be or where the electron could be. It's also a probability of how fast it might be moving. All of these things become probability functions.

You develop a mathematical theory for doing this that takes you until your third year in university to really know enough math to understand that. But basically that's right—these are forming waves, waves of the electron. So you have a wave of the electron around the nucleus describing what the electrons are. These are like standing waves, hitting a string. If different lengths, you get different tones, right? So different standing waves. And the electrons around the nucleus have different standing waves, and they go up in energy. And this is how we describe electron orbitals, right?

This theory was developed in the 1920s by Heisenberg and Schrödinger and other people. And although things are fuzzy, you can calculate things. You can calculate when an electron is going to absorb light, maybe change its shape and then reemit light. Maybe you have an LED and you have an electron going in one direction, it's in a different state, and it changes state. And quantum mechanically you can calculate the energy of the light that's going to come out, you can calculate the color of the light.

**David:** This was Niels Bohr's model of the atom, right? Where you had these energy levels that were described—these orbital levels where the electrons could exist around the nucleus. If you put energy in, the electron would jump to a higher level. If it would drop down a level, it would emit a photon—a particle of light with a very specific frequency. That's how you get atomic spectra. You can identify elements by the frequency signature that they emit, which is a function of what the electrons are doing in the atom.

**John:** Right. So you can calculate all these things and it matches experiments, and it makes sense. And there's a lot of applications from that. But on the other hand, this is just strange theory. The electrons are not really moving, they don't have a specific place. If you want to say, "Okay, I have this hydrogen atom, where is the electron?" Well, you want to see where it is, there are certain experiments you can do to actually make a measurement. You shine light or a particle on it, something to knock the electron off or something to see where it is. Then by doing the experiment, you localize the electron. Then you know where the electron is in some sense, because you've made a measurement. But by doing the measurement, you've disturbed the atom. And this is, of course, very strange. And people have argued for a hundred years about what does this really mean, and there's all sorts of interpretations of what this means.

The classical analogy would be if I'm listening to music on a speaker, I can feel the air going back and forth. If I want to measure the position of that air as it's vibrating back and forth, I can measure it. I can touch it or put a piece of paper in front of it to see it moving. But I'm not going to really change the air molecules as I put something there because there's so many of them. But when you go down to electrons where you're measuring single particles—single photons or single particles of some kind—then your measurement process actually changes the quantum mechanical state.

**David:** Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, right?

**John:** That's right. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle kind of embodies this. It says if I want to know where an atom is or an electron is—if I want to know its position very accurately—then I can't know its momentum or how fast it's moving. There's an uncertainty relationship there that the more I try to know one, the less I can know about the other. And this is just part of the nature of quantum mechanics.

## The Foundational Experiment and Macroscopic Quantum Effects

**David:** So bring us back to the work you did with your advisor, John Clarke, and with Michel Devoret. What was the experimental setup? What were you trying to demonstrate? And ultimately what did you demonstrate that won you the Nobel Prize?

**John:** The question was: Do large objects, big systems, behave quantum mechanically? Because all the quantum mechanical theory and experiments were done on small systems—electrons and atoms. So the proposal was to do macroscopic quantum mechanics. And the suggestion that Anthony Leggett made is if you have a Josephson junction—this is a junction where you have superconductors on both sides separated by an insulating barrier—there's this quantum mechanical tunneling of a supercurrent. And if you put this in a circuit, then that circuit is going to have some energy in it. And it might be able to quantum mechanically tunnel from one state to another.

When we started the experiment, first we had to learn how to make these Josephson junctions at the quality we needed to actually do the experiments. We had to make an insulating barrier that's a nanometer thick—just a few atoms thick. And we had to make this reproducibly. This took us about two years to learn how to make these devices. We had to make them such that the dissipation was very, very low so that the quantum mechanical energy was not dissipated during the measurement process. We had to make very special electrical filters so that we were measuring at low enough temperatures that the quantum mechanical energy was not blurred out by thermal fluctuations.

**David:** What temperature were you operating at?

**John:** We were operating at millikelvin temperatures—10 to 50 millikelvin, which is one hundredth or one fiftieth of one degree above absolute zero.

**David:** Pretty cold.

**John:** Pretty cold. And we had these special refrigerators that could actually get down to these low temperatures. The trick of these experiments is you measure an electrical circuit. The circuit wants to be in the state of zero voltage, and you're trying to get it to tunnel out of this state quantum mechanically to a different state. And so you have to design the experiment so that you can measure the tunneling rate and see if it agrees with the quantum mechanical prediction.

One of the things we did is we put a magnetic field through the Josephson junction. By changing the magnetic field, we could change the height of the barrier—the energy barrier that the system has to tunnel through. And by changing this barrier height, we could then measure how the tunneling rate changed. And this is directly comparable to the quantum mechanical theory.

When we did these experiments, we found that the tunneling rate changed exactly as quantum mechanics predicted. Moreover, the rate at which things tunneled was slow enough that we could actually watch individual tunneling events happen. Every 10 seconds or every second, we'd see a tunneling event—the circuit would jump from the zero voltage state to a voltage state. And we could measure this voltage very accurately with other superconducting devices we had developed. So we could actually watch individual quantum tunneling events happen in this macroscopic system.

This was quite remarkable because here was a system with billions of electrons all acting collectively, and they're all tunneling coherently—quantum mechanically tunneling as if they're one particle. And this was really the demonstration that macroscopic systems can behave quantum mechanically.

**David:** And this was fundamentally proving that quantum mechanical behavior wasn't just limited to the scale of individual atoms or subatomic particles, but could actually be demonstrated at a scale that humans can observe and measure directly.

**John:** That's right. And the key thing is all these electrons are acting collectively. They're acting as a single quantum mechanical particle. This is a macroscopic quantum state. And this opened up a whole field of research. After our experiments, many other people did experiments on these quantum mechanical circuits. People developed new ways to control these systems, new ways to measure them, new applications.

One of the big applications that came out of this is quantum computing. The idea is if you can have a quantum mechanical circuit that can be in a superposition of two states—it's in state zero and state one at the same time—then that's a quantum bit, a qubit. And if you can control many of these qubits and make them interact with each other, then you can do quantum computation. And this is something that many groups are working on now, including the group I work with at Google and many other companies and universities.

**David:** Let's talk about quantum computing for a moment. You mentioned qubits—quantum bits. In a classical computer, a bit is either a zero or a one. It's a binary state. But in a quantum computer, because of superposition, a qubit can be in both states simultaneously until you measure it. How does that enable fundamentally different computation?

**John:** The key thing is if you have one qubit, it can be in a superposition of zero and one. If you have two qubits, each can be in a superposition, so you have four different states that the system can be in at the same time. If you have three qubits, you have eight states. And so it goes exponentially. If you have 300 qubits, you have 2 to the 300 different states that the system can be in simultaneously.

Now, when you do a quantum computation, you're doing operations on all these states at the same time. So in some sense, you're doing a massively parallel computation. The catch is when you make a measurement at the end, you only get one answer. You don't get all 2 to the 300 answers. You get one answer that's randomly selected according to the quantum mechanical probability.

So the trick in quantum computing is to design your algorithm such that the answer you want has a high probability and all the wrong answers have a low probability. And there are certain algorithms where you can do this much better than you can with a classical computer. The most famous one is Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers, which is important for cryptography. Another one is Grover's algorithm for searching databases.

**David:** And your group at Google demonstrated what's called quantum supremacy in 2019, right?

**John:** That's right. What we did is we built a quantum processor with 53 qubits—53 of these superconducting circuits that we could control. And we did a computation that was specifically designed to be very hard for a classical computer but relatively easy for a quantum computer. The computation took about 200 seconds on our quantum processor. And we estimated it would take the best classical supercomputer about 10,000 years to do the same computation.

**David:** That's a pretty significant gap.

**John:** It's a pretty significant gap. Now, there was some controversy about this because some people said, "Well, with a better algorithm, maybe a classical computer could do it faster." And that's true. But the point is we demonstrated that there exists a computation where a quantum computer has a very significant advantage. And this was the first time anyone had done this. So we called it quantum supremacy—this is the point where a quantum computer can do something that a classical computer really can't do in a practical amount of time.

**David:** Where is the field now? How far are we from having quantum computers that can solve practical, useful problems?

**John:** That's a great question. The quantum supremacy experiment was a proof of principle. It showed that we could build a quantum processor that works, that the quantum mechanics works as we expect. But the computation we did wasn't useful for anything. It was just a demonstration.

To do useful computations, we need to do two things. First, we need to make the qubits better—we need to reduce the error rate. Right now, every time we do an operation on a qubit, there's about a one in a thousand or one in ten thousand chance that we make an error. That's too high. We need to get that down to maybe one in a million or one in a hundred million.

Second, we need to scale up the number of qubits. For useful computations, we probably need thousands or even millions of qubits. Right now, the best processors have maybe 100 to 1000 qubits. So we need to scale up by a factor of a thousand or more.

The good news is there's a lot of progress being made. Many groups are working on this. The error rates are coming down. The number of qubits is going up. And we're starting to see the first applications. For example, quantum computers are being used to simulate quantum systems—molecules and materials—which is very hard for classical computers. And there are applications in optimization, machine learning, and other areas.

My estimate is in the next 5 to 10 years, we'll start to see useful quantum computers that can solve real problems that classical computers can't solve efficiently. It's not going to replace classical computers—quantum computers are only better for certain types of problems. But for those problems, they could have a huge impact.

## Applications and Future Directions

**David:** What are some of the most exciting potential applications of quantum computing that you see?

**John:** One of the most exciting is drug discovery and materials science. If you want to design a new drug or a new material, you need to understand how molecules behave. And molecules are quantum mechanical systems. So to simulate them accurately, you need to solve the Schrödinger equation for all the electrons in the molecule. This is exponentially hard for classical computers, but it's relatively straightforward for quantum computers—at least in principle.

So with a quantum computer, you could simulate a molecule and predict its properties before you actually synthesize it in the lab. You could screen millions of candidate drugs computationally and only synthesize the most promising ones. This could dramatically speed up drug discovery and reduce costs.

Another application is in cryptography. As I mentioned, quantum computers can break current encryption schemes based on factoring large numbers. But they can also enable new forms of encryption that are provably secure—quantum cryptography. So there's a race going on. People are developing post-quantum cryptography—new encryption schemes that are secure against quantum computers. And people are developing quantum communication networks that use quantum mechanics to provide secure communication.

A third application is in optimization. Many important problems—like routing vehicles, scheduling tasks, designing supply chains—are optimization problems. And they're exponentially hard for classical computers. Quantum computers might be able to solve these problems more efficiently.

**David:** Let's talk about the competitive landscape. There's a lot of concern about progress in quantum computing in China compared to the US. What's your perspective on where different countries stand?

**John:** I can talk about my own field. When I've read the papers that duplicated what we did at Google on the quantum supremacy experiment, the Chinese researchers know what they're doing. They go through the theory, they talk about a lot—it's very similar to what we're doing, but they know what they're doing and they're getting great results.

The thing that scares me a little bit is last December the Google group published the latest results, which is really much nicer. They made some real improvement. But then China soon afterward published something indicating they were on par or near par with it. I'm worried that the Chinese government is saying, "Well, you can't publish anything until it's in the Western press, and then you can talk about it." That's precisely what I've heard.

So I'm a little bit concerned about that. Now, what we're doing with our company is we're doing a new generation of fabrication of the devices. I would consider in my research we had simple fabrication with the original papers in '85, and then around 2000 we had more sophisticated fabrication. And then for the quantum supremacy experiment, we did something even more complicated. Other groups did too. But we want to do a similar jump in the fabrication.

What's interesting about this is we're going to be using Applied Materials and the modern fabrication processes that they have, which are on 300-millimeter tools. You can't get these in China, for example. You can get them for CMOS. And they're developing—we're developing—standard processes, but new recipes and new ways to put it together. We think by doing that we can do a huge leapfrog and then get there faster and get there in a way that will protect our lead.

There's other things we're doing too. But we think there's a way to really lead the field. We're happy we have good industrial partners—Applied Materials, Synopsys design tools, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, some startups who do the theory work. We have a good consortium and we want to use all that knowledge and expertise of engineering to make this happen.

## Receiving the Nobel Prize

**David:** Where were you when you got the news this week that you won the Nobel Prize? And how surprised were you? Because this is a 40-year-old research effort. Had anyone been giving you a call, rumor mill saying, "Hey, you're on the list this year, potentially being considered"?

**John:** Let me give you a little bit of the inside story. We've known that this was an important experiment from the beginning. We've obtained some other prizes that are much less well-known, and we're really appreciative of all that. What happens is the Nobel system put together Nobel symposiums where they get together physicists in a certain field—quantum information and this kind of thing—and they have all the scientists give talks. And they want to check on the vitality of the field, how big is it? And also maybe some of the leaders—can they give a good talk? Would they be a good representative?

So Michel and John and I have been to these symposiums before, and we knew what was going on—that at least we were considered. But I'll just tell you as a scientist, just to be invited to these and be considered is a fantastic honor. Having the prize is just so unbelievable that you shouldn't think that way.

So I've known about it for a few years. And in fact, to be very honest, in the past when the dates have come around, it's like, "Oh, is this going to happen?" And then you wake up in the morning and it's like, "Oh, it didn't happen." And you're kind of down for a day. It didn't happen this year. And that's a very bad attitude. I don't like that at all. You should not covet some insanely difficult prize that only goes to a few people.

So what happened this year is I worked through this over several years and this year I just forgot about it. So I went to bed, and then we got the call at 3:00, and my wife answered the phone and found out what happened. But she didn't wake me up right away because she knew the day was going to be hectic and I needed my sleep to not be grumpy.

**David:** That was nice of her.

**John:** Don't want to be grumpy talking. So she woke me up at 5:30, and as I looked at the computer, "Oh my God." And then we had some reporters coming over at 6:00 which interviewed me right when I had found out, half hour after I'd found out.

And it's great. It's a great honor. And it's just been really fun. And then I've been getting a lot of emails from people I've worked with or students I've had in the past congratulating me, and you exchange little stories and the like. And it's a very special time.

## Other Fields of Interest

**David:** Any science or technology fields that you've been following outside of your core discipline that you think are really exciting?

**John:** I always like to hear what major thinkers—to be honest, I'm just so focused on doing this. And especially when you start a company, you better be focused, right? So I'm doing that. But one of the fields that I find—this is someone, Ben Mazin, at UC Santa Barbara—is looking for exoplanets, and they're using superconducting detectors that are somewhat similar to what we're doing.

In fact, in the 1990s or so, I helped establish that field with other people and did that for five, six, seven years. But he's doing it in a different way. And I really like how this instrumentation that we've been working on—these quantum devices—are now able to do these astronomy detectors and look for these exoplanets. And of course, there's so much going on in astronomy these days with gravitational detectors and exoplanet searches. And it's just really fascinating to me. And again, it's very much technology-oriented where people are building good detectors. This is what I like. I like building instruments. So that's particularly interesting.

**David:** Yeah, that's great. I mean, very exciting field. And hopefully we'll develop quantum computers that will help us build materials and technology to help us get there one day.

**John:** That's right.

**David:** Many rungs on the ladder of human progress. Well, congratulations again on winning the Nobel Prize in Physics this year. Very well deserved. It's a fantastic moment. Enjoy it. Enjoy the ceremony. And we're excited for your continued work in the field of material quantum computing.

**John:** Thank you. I really enjoyed the questions and the flow where you were asking questions to explain it at the right level for people. And I really appreciate that. This is a great podcast.

**David:** Great. Thank you.
