# AI Predictions for 2026: Five Trajectories of Transformation

The frontier model development landscape is poised for four to five significant shifts in the coming year. The most profound transition will be the evolution from chatbots to operating systems. Claude Code already demonstrates the beginnings of this transformation. Within Claude's desktop application, there exists a wrapper around your computer's command line interface—the terminal. This creates a more intuitive and native approach for humans to interact with their entire computing environment.

Power users will increasingly migrate from web interfaces, where AI's ability to manipulate the computer remains minimal, to desktop applications that integrate directly with the operating system and command line interface. At this integration level, the AI moves closer to becoming the operating system itself. You effectively gain an AI capable of controlling your entire computer—an engineer more capable than most people, operating across the full problem space of your machine. It can access the web at will and operate within it seamlessly. The fundamental shift is toward talking to your computer rather than using it. We're witnessing the early signs with Claude Code and its CLI integration. These tools are already changing the world, though the future remains unevenly distributed. The AGI will reside in the CLI—that's the essential framework to understand.

The second major development centers on enhanced memory systems. We're already seeing glimpses of this with current models. Those who use these systems deeply to solve problems and reason through challenges understand the profound capability emerging: the ability to retrieve information from conversations held months or even a year ago, pulling that context into the present conversation precisely when it proves useful, recombining information to generate novel insights. This represents a preview of 2026, yet we already possess it in 2025.

By early to mid-2026, models will excel at this retrieval and recombination. OpenAI has announced another model representing a substantial leap beyond current capabilities, arriving in the first quarter of 2026. Grok 5 will also emerge in that same timeframe. The proliferation of advancement in Q1 2026 will be remarkable. Better memory will create the sensation of an almost magical infinite context window for retrieving memories and intuitively recombining them with insights unfolding in real-time conversation.

What excites me personally is the prospect of shared memory across different interfaces. Your CLI will access the same memory as your web interface. You'll use ChatGPT in the CLI exactly as you currently use it through the web—returning to the concept of the desktop wrapper around the CLI. All frontier model companies will focus on the CLI while making it more intuitive. This becomes the computer AGI, the Star Trek computer realized: you speak to the computer, and it executes tasks far better than any human could manage. This future is arriving. It's beginning now. By the end of next year, it will be practically fully realized.

The implications of unified memory across web and CLI interfaces are profound and underappreciated. The third frontier development involves superior multimodal reasoning. We currently possess some multimodal reasoning capability, but it will approach near-human levels in understanding web interfaces, user experience, user interfaces, and the actual design of these systems. If you're using Cursor or coding agents, you likely capture numerous screenshots of your user interface, requesting refinements and improvements. Sometimes the models comprehend your intent; sometimes they don't. They lack a refined grasp of what constitutes good user interface design, optimal user experience, or best practices in these domains. Some excel in specific areas—certain models perform well with marketing copy or advertising—but achieving true 10-out-of-10 multimodal reasoning where models understand optimal design across various contexts represents the next leap.

These models will develop refined judgment about what makes effective design—where to position elements, how to style components, what appeals to users. This reasoning will extend beyond interfaces to the physical world: understanding manufacturing processes, physical design considerations, engineering constraints. We'll approach human-level multimodal reasoning, though it may not fully arrive in 2026. The trajectory points clearly in this direction.

The fourth development concerns long-horizon planning and autonomous problem-solving. Models will become substantially better at this over the coming year. They'll demonstrate improved ability to work independently on problems, iterating for extended periods—hours or potentially days—autonomously reasoning through challenges, developing solutions, executing them, evaluating results, adjusting approaches, and repeating this cycle. This moves us closer to genuine autonomous agents that operate for extended durations without human intervention. While we won't achieve completely autonomous agents solving arbitrary problems in 2026, we'll witness significant progress. By year's end, we may see agents capable of managing tasks for several hours or even overnight autonomously before requiring human oversight.

The fifth development involves better tool use and API integration. Models will excel at understanding when and how to employ various tools. They'll make more intelligent decisions about tool selection, use tools more effectively, and integrate multiple tools in sophisticated ways. This represents another area where substantial improvement seems inevitable.

Physical AI constitutes the second major category. We're already observing remarkable progress with humanoid robots. Companies like Figure, Tesla with Optimus, 1X, and Boston Dynamics are demonstrating significant capabilities. Next year will likely bring us closer to viable humanoid robots performing useful work. This doesn't necessarily mean mass deployment in factories—that may require another year or two. But we'll probably see initial commercial deployments in controlled environments, with robots executing simple repetitive tasks. The technology continues advancing rapidly.

Beyond humanoid robots, physical AI encompasses autonomous vehicles and drones—any system where AI operates in the physical world through robotic platforms. I anticipate meaningful progress across these domains. We may not achieve fully autonomous vehicles in all conditions during 2026, but continued advancement seems certain. Physical AI represents a crucial development area because it extends AI capabilities beyond the digital realm into physical reality, enabling AI to perform actual physical work.

The third category examines impacts on entrepreneurship and market dynamics. This will be fascinating to observe. AI is creating entirely new opportunities. Individuals are building businesses that weren't previously feasible. Solo developers are creating and launching products that would have required entire teams in the past. We're seeing the emergence of single-person companies generating millions in revenue because AI handles so much of the operational work.

Simultaneously, AI intensifies competition. When everyone possesses access to powerful AI tools, the barrier to entry for many businesses decreases substantially. This creates a more competitive landscape. You must leverage AI effectively to maintain competitiveness, as your competitors certainly will be. This dynamic creates both opportunities and challenges. It enables more people to build businesses and create value, while simultaneously making competition more fierce.

I think we'll witness an explosion of entrepreneurship and new business formation. The number of people attempting to build businesses will increase dramatically because AI makes it more accessible. Many will fail—more businesses fail than succeed under any circumstances—but the sheer volume of attempts will rise substantially. We'll see more successful businesses emerging from this expanded pool of entrepreneurs.

Market dynamics will shift as AI-native companies possess advantages over traditional companies slow to adapt. Companies that integrate AI deeply into their operations, using it to enhance every aspect of their business, will outcompete those treating AI as a mere tool or failing to adopt it at all. This will drive market consolidation in some areas, with AI-native companies acquiring or displacing traditional companies. Simultaneously, it will create market fragmentation in other areas as new niches and opportunities emerge that weren't previously viable.

The overall effect on entrepreneurship and markets will be transformative. We're entering a period of significant change and opportunity. Those who adapt and learn to work effectively with AI will thrive. Those who don't will struggle.

The fourth category concerns impacts on labor markets and jobs. This is perhaps the most contentious and debated topic. I think the reality is more nuanced than either extreme position suggests. AI will not immediately replace all jobs, nor will it have no impact on employment. The truth lies between these extremes.

We'll likely see AI beginning to automate certain tasks within jobs rather than eliminating entire job categories. This will change the nature of many jobs. Some roles will become more productive as AI handles routine tasks, freeing humans for higher-level work. Other roles may see reduced demand as AI assumes more responsibilities.

I expect we'll observe the beginning of labor market displacement in certain areas. Some job categories, particularly those involving routine cognitive work or tasks that AI can perform well, will start seeing reduced employment. This won't happen overnight—it will be gradual. But the trend will become visible during 2026.

Simultaneously, new job categories will emerge. As AI creates new capabilities and possibilities, new types of work will arise. People will find ways to create value that we can't fully anticipate yet. This has been the pattern with every major technological transformation throughout history.

The key question is whether new job creation will offset job displacement, and at what pace. I think the pace of change will accelerate. We may see periods where displacement outpaces new job creation, creating temporary dislocation and adjustment challenges. Society will need to grapple with these transitions.

One critical point: for individuals, the strategy is clear. Learn to work with AI. Develop skills that complement AI rather than compete with it. Focus on areas where human judgment, creativity, emotional intelligence, and other distinctly human capabilities remain valuable. Those who position themselves this way will find abundant opportunities. Those who attempt to compete directly with AI in areas where it excels will struggle.

The wage premium for AI-native skills will likely increase substantially. People who can effectively leverage AI tools to amplify their productivity will command higher compensation. This creates both opportunity and inequality risk. If access to AI education and tools remains uneven, we could see widening wage gaps. Ensuring broad access to AI capabilities becomes important for societal reasons.

I'll add an important nuance here that I've mentioned in previous discussions. People need to understand that this technology might create opportunities that dwarf everything currently existing. The industrial revolution created far more jobs and far more wealth than existed before it. The information revolution did the same. The AI revolution could follow this pattern at an even larger scale.

It may take time for people to adjust and recognize these opportunities, but they could prove ten times larger than all current opportunities combined. The crucial understanding is that people view this as a replacement technology, and it does replace those who fail to adapt. But as long as you accelerate with the technology and adapt continuously, it's an enabling technology, not fundamentally a replacement technology.

Many people envision a solved world, a post-scarcity utopia. I do think the future will be relatively post-scarcity compared to today. If you examine today versus 300 years ago, we already inhabit post-scarcity by that comparison. Extrapolating forward a decade, I think we'll witness nearly 300 years worth of change within the next ten to twenty years. Anything you can imagine—essentially all of your needs will be met. Everything beyond that becomes a vanity metric.

AI won't be replacing jobs in the simple sense. It's raising the bar for entry. I've mentioned this in past videos: replacing isn't the right term. It's raising the bar for entry and fundamentally changing the landscape. It depends on your definition of jobs. Jobs will disappear. Work will not. We may or may not call future work "jobs." The concept of work and labor won't vanish. The title "job" might evolve, though we might continue using that term for reasons we can't yet foresee. That's my nuanced take. But I will say that 2026 will likely mark the beginning of AI genuinely transforming labor markets.

The fifth category represents the most significant development: impacts on scientific discovery. This is profound because everything in the economy, everything in human progress, connects directly to our rate of scientific discovery. New scientific discoveries enable new technologies, which create greater GDP growth, greater human abundance—electrification, combustion engines, and every transformative technology throughout history. This acceleration in scientific discovery will begin in earnest next year, and that's where the most profound changes emerge.

Biology acceleration, self-driving labs, and simulation over trial and error represent three interconnected developments. Let's examine each.

Biology acceleration is already underway. We have protein folding models like AlphaFold, and we have large language models like current frontier systems. The most advanced models available now serve as the most capable scientific tools on Earth. Researchers like David Sinclair are conducting biological research using protein folding models integrated with advanced language models, creating a unified system that can reason across vast amounts of data that humans cannot process as quickly. They're using these tools for recombinatory innovation—finding novel insights by combining existing knowledge in new ways.

This is happening today. When you consider it deeply, all innovation is essentially recombining insights from previous insights, generating new understanding through novel combinations. Recombinatory innovation. These models are already performing this function. This is already occurring at an accelerating pace. Biology acceleration will continue intensifying. The compounding effect continues building.

Self-driving labs represent the next development. In biology and material science, AI will drive robotic wet labs. The AI will formulate hypotheses, instruct robots to mix chemicals, observe results, learn from failures, and design the next experiment—operating continuously around the clock without sleep. Obviously, human oversight will remain important. When humans are awake, they'll review progress and ensure the work proceeds in the right direction. But the robots will continue operating while humans sleep. Humans wake up, verify the direction, and maintain high-level guidance. This will clearly accelerate scientific progress.

Simulation over trial and error represents the third development. I find this particularly remarkable. I'm uncertain whether this will fully materialize next year, but I expect it within the next several years. Imagine simulations with physics-grade accuracy, conducting simulated biology within these systems. This might not arrive in 2026, but I anticipate it within the next handful of years.

This is when we approach Ray Kurzweil's longevity escape velocity concepts. When you combine accelerated biology through protein folding and super-intelligent unified models reasoning about these systems, with self-driving labs conducting experiments, with simulation replacing traditional trial and error in research and development—this becomes transformative.

I envision a near future where every person will have their genome sequenced. Very soon, every individual in developed countries, then rapidly spreading to all other countries, will have their complete DNA sequence available. We'll have advanced AI systems reasoning about all the data continuously collected from our specific bodies. We'll possess a comprehensive information pipeline that we can understand simply because AI systems digest and interpret it for us. We'll know precisely what's occurring inside our bodies.

Perhaps not long after, we'll have bespoke medicines—self-driving labs, simulation biology systems, whatever we call them—creating medicines for our specific needs. Gene therapies tailored to individual requirements. Designer drugs, designer medications, designer treatments. This isn't distant if you consider the trajectory carefully.

This returns us to Ray Kurzweil's longevity escape velocity concept. Once we achieve sufficient capability in these areas, who's to say you can't upgrade yourself, become something more? That future approaches rapidly.

Let me synthesize all of this into one conclusion. My meta-prediction for 2026 is that it will simultaneously feel like AI is everywhere while also seeming overhyped, depending on what you're measuring. The hype cycle will oscillate as it always does. But the underlying capability curves will continue climbing relentlessly.

That's what we've been observing: many people discuss the AI bubble, claiming everything is overhyped. Meanwhile, I'm witnessing this extraordinary progress. The people who continue building through the next trough, through whatever temporary downturn in sentiment—those people will own the next decade. It's that straightforward.

Those focused on hype will react to whatever narrative dominates the internet at any moment. But the people on the ground actually working with these tools, building with this technology, truly witnessing and observing what's actually occurring, accelerating and adapting alongside the technology—these are the people who will own the next decade while everyone else remains fixated on hype cycles.
