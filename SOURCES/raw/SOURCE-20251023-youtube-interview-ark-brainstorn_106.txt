SpaceX’s New Milestones
0:00
Welcome to the Brainstorm episode 106. Today we're talking SpaceX and
0:06
sequencing. Um, may as well kick off with SpaceX. A lot
0:13
of exciting things happening over the weekend. First, you had Starship test
0:19
flight, which was incredibly successful. Uh then over the weekend you had the
0:25
31st reuse of a booster and I think SpaceX hit 10,000 satellites launched.
0:32
Uh I remember when we first started this
0:37
uh endeavor looking at reusable rockets. I remember specifically there there was an orbital ATK call where the CEO said,
0:46
you know, reusable rockets aren't a new thing. We've looked at them and they're not economic. Uh, and here we are
0:55
a decade later, 31 reuses. Brett, what was your biggest takeaway of the
1:00
Starship test flight? I I mean, as with all this stuff they
1:06
do, they start out and it looks impossible, and then they do something that looks like maybe it's possible, but
1:12
they can do it once, and then slowly as they go, um, it just becomes more and
1:17
more routine. Uh, you know, the fact that they can lob
1:23
this this top of the rocket halfway around the world, have its fins get half burned through and it still like come
1:29
and land on the spot next to a buoy. Uh, and then over time the fins are getting less burned through and now they're
1:35
intentionally taking heat tiles off to see if they can destroy it and it's surviving is just so different from most
1:43
aerospace where it's like one little thing goes wrong and it prompts a catastrophic failure. here. Um, it's so
1:49
clear that they're designing a more robust system. And I think of Elon's, you know, Elon has this magic formula
1:55
that part of which is like you just take out and simplify processes and and and
2:01
remove the best part is no part. You take out parts along the way. You make it simpler and simpler and simpler. um
2:07
and how different that is than the space shuttle which was has you know probably
2:14
millions of complex interconnected you know engineering systems all with their own engineering margin uh and
2:20
prospectively the space shuttle was supposed to I think have on the order of a one in a 100,000 chance of failing but
2:26
practically it had like a one in a 100 chance of failing um or so uh much to
2:32
everybody's regret um here by taking out all those complex interconnections
2:38
because you're just focusing on the systems that matter. It seems like you can build a launch vehicle that ends up
2:44
much more robust to just being bashed around by the atmosphere.
The Importance Of Starlink
2:49
So, oh, I was going to say one one of the things that still blows my mind and it's just like common now is how amazing the
2:59
video is because of Starlink. It's like that's totally underappreciated. It's like here's an antenna that's also going
3:05
through the atmosphere and an incredible it's like better connection than uh you
3:12
know a dish TV on a rainy day. Yeah. And also that that also means that
3:18
they get data out of the system as they're going. So kind of it the
3:23
Starlink satellites are um useful for me. I'm on a Starlink right now because my internet's down. um and um useful for
3:31
SpaceX in terms of even if the the rocket blows into smitherines at the end, they still are collecting all of
3:38
the telemetry and optical data along the way. And ultimately, the optical data is very useful for seeing, hey, this is
3:44
what's going on with the heat tiles, where burnthrough is happening, stuff that you can't necessarily um, you know,
3:50
you can't have a sensor on every single heat tile to tell you how it's performing. And so, you need kind of like that. The reason they have multiple
3:57
buoys and drones like you know um filming it as it comes down is not just because it looks badass. It's because
4:05
kind you can get a better information on what's going on with the ship as it
4:10
comes down. What are the remaining obstacles from where Starship is today to where it
4:18
ultimately needs to be? Well, it needs to be on Mars. So,
The Next Phase Of Starship
4:24
so many obstacles. So, there there are many there are many obstacles, but so this was uh the last
4:30
iteration of this version of Starship. So, they're going to move on to the next testing. So, there's going to be new
4:37
rocket engines. There's going to be a new Starship. It's going to keep getting bigger is my understanding, but like a
4:44
key operational element is going to be the reuse of the heat shield itself.
4:52
uh and the inorbit refueling. So, those are, I'd say, are kind of two near-term
4:59
things that are going to be tested uh and will open up the flight envelope
5:04
quite dramatically. Yeah. And I'm I am I think the engineering challenge of making the top
5:11
actually reusable coming through the atmosphere and quickly turnable is really thorny and nasty. And it would
5:18
not surprise me if that you know every they from the beginning landing a rocket
5:24
people were like well that's a bridge too far like you said Sam and even SpaceX was like ah maybe we'll get it done twothirds of the time now they nail
5:31
it every time and now you know bringing a heat shield through the atmosphere and
5:36
having it reusable afterwards just seems so impossible. I mean, you're subjecting
5:42
those tiles to so much heat stress, it's hard to imagine that at the end of that
5:48
they are okay, clean, ready to go again. Um, and it could be that that turns out to be, you know, there are some things
5:55
that are, you know, beyond the scope of our ability to engineer our way out of them. Um, and uh, you know, if they can
6:02
do it, it it opens up things like, you know, going from New York to Japan in an
6:07
hour trip and some of the um, other business models they're going after. But I think even if they can't do that, they
6:13
still are well on track for low Earth orbit, giant satellite constellation. And even Mars without that, I think is
6:19
is perfectly within reason. Yeah. And this was something we discussed, right? It's like just going
6:25
from Falcon 9 to Starship, you dramatically lower the cost to orbit on
6:31
a kilogram uh denominated basis and you totally change what's possible because
6:37
of the volume that you can put up. So both mass and volume being key key
6:43
elements here. Uh and then the rapid reusability is cherry on top for a lot
6:50
of other use cases. Can you swap out the heat shield fast enough that it maybe
6:57
doesn't matter for it to be fully reusable or is the cost of the heat shield enough that you really want it to
7:03
be reusable and not something you can hot swap in and out? I don't think the cost is that major.
7:11
It's like I think it is significant but in terms of the whole thing and it's like sure you could have mult right it's
7:18
like even if you had a one day turnaround if you had enough launch pads then that's fine right it's like you
7:24
just you have to have a fleet of more rockets uh I think it gets more
7:30
I don't know I mean like but they have to like individually glue on those tiles I just
7:36
think the the promise of if you are Sam this is your work but the time itakes takes to turn the rocket is correlated
7:42
with the expense because you have people basically working on the thing while that happens. And I would imagine if you
7:49
look at the total manufacturer time of the Starship, a substantial portion of
7:54
it is like putting the tiles onto the rocket. Uh and so I do think that that's
8:01
we've got we've got humanoid baroque architecture Brett Winton saying that we're not going to have Gluerbot to
8:07
solve this. Yes, he might. I mean, I think I guess there's a question kind of implicit. It
8:15
will you be able to like look at the tiles and be like, "Oh, that one needs replacing." And then pluck it off and put another one on. Maybe that is like a
8:21
way you could go about it. Well, I do think it's like that's somewhat what comes back to the most incredible thing of this most recent
8:28
test is it's not that they were trying to make it successful, right? It this
8:34
was the final push of the envelope on this version, right? And so to that point, being able to strip out
8:42
tons of tiles and have it succeed, I think like the robustness of the system should
8:49
lead to more rapid reusability. Yeah, it at least means you can like fly
8:56
it once, it's semi- damaged, you can fly it again and be like, okay, well, maybe we bring it back this time or not. But,
9:02
you know, it's at least like the heat the heat shield doesn't matter on the going up.
9:08
So, if you land it, like you can at least launch it one more time, which makes a difference economically. Um, and
9:13
you know, and maybe you're just landing it knowing at some point it's going to come back in and kind of like you have
9:19
it set to incinerate above the the ocean rather than anywhere else. Um,
9:26
all right, let's let's move on. We've got uh sequencing next. Brett pack bio
Why Hasn’t Gene Sequencing Delivered On Its Promise?
9:33
continuing to drop the cost of long read sequencing. Um maybe for all of us
9:40
involved. Quick quick primer. Yeah, long read. Long read versus short read.
9:46
Why one is better than the other, but the other one still has a future? Maybe, maybe not. And it's already so cheap.
9:53
Why isn't everyone getting it done? How come this hasn't solved all of our problems yet? Wow. Is that a compound question or
9:59
what? Um so the way gene sequencers work and specifically aluminina's gene sequencer um which is the dominant one
10:06
in the industry it does you know the vast vast majority of um sequencing volume uh is you take DNA which is three
10:15
billion letters long you chop it into little bits um because you're extracting out of the cell it gets all broken up uh
10:21
and then you take all those little bits and you amplify and multiply them uh and
10:26
then you sequence all of those little bits. So on three billion letters, each bit is maybe 150 letters long. Uh and so
10:33
then once you sequence them all, you have to then use, you know, good algorithms to be like, oh, this overlaps
10:40
here and therefore these two puzzle pieces stick together. And so you reconstruct the entire sequence based
10:46
upon all the little chunky puzzle pieces. Uh and so that works. That
10:52
technology works and is inexpensive for calling individual letter base pairs and
10:57
kind of you know things that happen over tens of letters in the genome. But you
11:02
can imagine if you have a sequence that's like inverted or you have a bunch a sequence that's repeating a number of
11:08
times. Uh cutting it into little 150 base pair fragments means that you can't
11:14
tell how the puzzle goes back together. It could go back together with this fragment this way or this way. So with
11:20
long read sequencing um you basically take a much longer chain uh and so you
11:25
can uh and that's what pack bio offers and so you can see all those structural variations and there's a lot of diseases
11:31
that are probably related to that to repeat errors and um and we don't understand those diseases as well in
11:38
part because it's been so expensive and hard to measure them um and so pack bio is cutting its prices to $300 per genome
11:46
for long read sequencing alum Aluminina at the cutting edge looks like it's around $200. Um, you know, rewind the
11:54
clock to the beginning of the, you know, the early 2000s and it was $2 billion.
11:59
So, um, you know, 300 versus 200 versus 2 billion. You know, this is clearly
12:05
like a lot less expensive than it used to be. Um, and so it's certainly long read
12:11
sequencing is very interesting from a research perspective. If you do research with it and you and you can really pin
12:16
down, hey, these are diseases that um are related to structural variation, um
12:22
then that will feed into the ability of drug developers to develop, you know,
12:27
drugs to go after those specific diseases. And so then it becomes more useful to be able to diagnose them because you're not just diagnosing them
12:33
and saying, "Hey, this is something that's wrong." You're saying, "Hey, this is something that's wrong and then here's a solution for it." But that gets
12:40
to kind of like the challenge of biology. We're so early that um kind of
12:46
people align around a tool that generates a lot of useful information that then they develop drugs that are
12:51
aligned up against that information or develop best practices for how to treat people lined up against that specific
12:57
kind of information. And so it's hard to get everybody to shift over to a different kind of like richer um data
13:04
set. And so Aluminina has been thus far dominant in the industry. Um and their
13:10
short read is particularly well suited for um getting DNA fragments out of blood which is how all modern kind of
13:17
cancer testing is shifting where um the a cancer in your body will slough off
13:23
small fragments in the blood. Um so it doesn't matter that luminos machines can only uh measure small fragments because
13:29
that's exactly what uh cancer is shifting off. And so therefore you can diagnose and and really guide treatment
13:35
for cancer just based on blood samples. And um that's kind of like the the growth area of the diagnostic industry.
13:42
Um so PAC bios instruments are super interesting. They're under capitalized relative to certainly aluminina. Um and
13:50
the space has broadly been challenging. Um, you know, we'll see if kind of like this lower cost for long read sequencing
13:57
catalyzes, you know, more researchers to use it um and gets into kind of translational and clinical medicine in a
14:04
more profound way. Is the long read or short read market larger long term? As in like when you've
14:12
modeled this out with the team, the TAM, what does it look like one versus the
14:17
other? I you really have to make it's from
14:23
where we are today you would say that um kind of at from where you are today you
14:29
would say short read remains dominant for some amount of time and ultimately we should want all this
14:34
information like ultimately the the the the information you're missing by not
14:41
using long read hurts your ability to understand the biology I think the the problem is we are understanding of
14:49
biology is so so crude um that that there's still plenty of like juice in
14:55
the lemon staying on the short read stack and Aluminina does things like hey you can kind of barcode and stitch
15:00
together these short reads to get synthetic long reads that aren't as good as pack bios but they get you some of
15:06
the way there um and so I think it's hard to you can say like at a high level
15:11
yes we should be doing all long read we shouldn't be leaving information on the table um but the crossover point is
15:18
harder to um you can't tell when the industry is going to like recalibrate
15:23
around a different set of instruments and tools and aluminina tried to buy pack value um and uh was ultimately um
15:31
stopped due to FTC stuff um and uh so they they saw this as as the future um
15:39
and if they had if that had happened and it had been a consolidated entity then
15:44
maybe the transition happened sooner because they tried to shift their entire commercial customer base over. Um so
15:50
it's really um a very contingent path of technology because how messily the
15:57
monetization and kind of of health stuff generally happens and how many
16:02
interconnected kind of independent players there are. All right, let's move on to our chart
16:09
parenthesy s of the week. Uh, if you want to be sad, go look at Brett's
16:16
Twitter about how little time you have with your children. But for for the purpose of this brainstorm, we're gonna
16:22
go to Nick uh and your prediction market
16:27
chart. Why? Why this chart? Why this chart? Well, we have for the
16:34
first time the uh on a weekly volume basis, the prediction market notional
16:40
volume has uh eclipsed 2 billion. So, you know, we've embedded a prediction
16:46
market segment into the show and we're riding a wave that doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. Um, and I
16:52
think what's also interesting about this chart specifically, we had been noticing
16:58
um, and you can you see it up on the screen, you can notice that Koshi had been taking share or maybe it was the
17:05
lack of volume coming from sports into poly market, but it was almost, you
17:10
know, a week ago where Koshi was, call it 70ish% of the total market. Um and it
17:16
looks like uh what has occurred in this past week has shifted the or we're swinging back towards a 5050 market
17:24
between uh Poly Market and Koshi. So pretty interesting to see the market dynamics at play. Koshi just launched
17:30
internationally. Um Poly Market has been a much bigger international player than in the US. They've now moved into the
Prediction Market Volume Eclipses $2B
17:37
US. So you're starting to see the turf war shape up pretty significantly um in a very fast and dynamic moving market.
17:46
And how should we think about like do you think that the way the market is going to move it's going to be at some level and then the next election cycle
17:53
it's going to 10x whatever that is again as in will prediction market still on a
17:58
like election particularly presidential election basis suddenly grow like 10x and then that creates a new kind of
18:05
base. Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think and we're going through the work now and
18:11
Brett, I'm waiting for a response from you, so I'm calling you out publicly on how to try and dimension dimension out
18:18
the the TAM. Um, which is, you know, like if you think about uh politics and
18:23
maybe geopolitical events, that is probably going to be some percent share of the total market. I think the more
18:30
work that we do here, um, and as we really start to ramp on this, I really think the the large opportunity is in,
18:38
you know, taking away from what has historically been secondord trades in the financial market. As in you have
Wall Street X Prediction Markets
18:45
this geopolitical event or you have something that is uh being played out in
18:50
the traditional market by you know changing your equity exposure or gathering an options position hedging
18:56
out some sort of risk using secondorder derivative products as in it's not a direct bet on the event itself and that
19:04
I think is a huge market long term but it's going to come I think the majority of the volume is going to come from the
19:10
financial market and the way people play you know uh uh like options and and and
19:16
and futures contracts that's all going to shift over into the prediction market. I think like culturally I've
19:23
seen a lot about mention markets. So what is you know the president of the United States going to say in his next speech? All of that I think is
19:30
interesting but I don't know how much of it can be you know the majority of the volume longer term unless you just have
19:37
you know AI agents trading with each other in like at the speed of light. I I I think it's more you know the the major
19:44
market and disruption is going to happen to traditional instruments people have used in the financial market that now
19:50
fall over into event driven contracts. Yeah. And actually I think volume volume
19:57
is good because it's easy to measure but the the actual way in which we'll
20:02
measure the economic importance of these is basically like the open interest like how much do people have at risk against
20:09
the markets in aggregate because as AI agents get in you could have volume explode but that doesn't mean there's
20:14
actually more risk on you know it just means that like kind of like you're at the margin keeping keeping the contract
20:20
at the right efficient price you know um because they're you know buying selling and buying and selling. Uh, and I think
20:27
like I 100% agree that the reason these are interesting is because they could become profoundly
20:33
financially useful for real sizable market actors. Um, I think that if you
20:40
look at Tesla for example, we're all familiar with Tesla. Um, the there is
20:45
you could you could imagine there are two sets of owners of Tesla. there is a set of owners that is basically just
20:52
basing it on the next 12 months financials and they are saying well I
20:58
think it's going to trade at this on IBIT dot and I'm just trading that I actually don't care about anything that happens downstream from that and then
21:04
there's another set that's like I'm making a multi-year bet on what robo taxi is going to happen and what it's going to look like and if you could
21:11
force those actors to actually cleanly um acknowledge like the other side of
21:16
the bet like if somebody could bet on robo taxi and actually hedge out the risk of what happens with deliveries and
21:23
gross margin and stuff on the quarterly metrics. Um then you would actually get a cleaner sense and underwrite for what
21:31
is built into that stock in terms of robo taxi expectations and what's built into kind of like the core EV business.
21:40
uh and you know my strong belief is actually the robo taxi is poorly underwritten because there's no
21:45
mechanism by which somebody could cleanly um get exposure to that contract
21:52
uh to the greater it goes from the trend of single stock ETFs to single component of stock
21:59
yeah single single yeah line item ETF single segment it's a great example given what we
22:04
talked about last week which is Elon's pay package which is just a set of event contract contracts for him specifically.
22:11
But if you wanted the market to also align by him, what do you do now? You as an individual go out and buy equities or
22:17
options on the share price of Tesla going up. In theory, if there was enough liquidity, um you could take the same
22:25
exact bets that Elon is personally making with the company by signing on to the pay pay package and not have to
22:31
worry about how the broader market attributes that to the stock price. You can just make a yes or no bet. Will
22:37
there be 1 million bots delivered in X period of time? Which is what Elon's doing. Like he's he has an event
22:44
contract now um like a nested event contract now with with shareholders and
22:49
quite the parlay if you will. Yeah. Quite the parlay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and I think like a way to
22:56
think about financial markets is these are common knowledge generators and it's expensive to generate common knowledge.
23:02
So common knowledge is knowledge that you know that I know and I know that you know that I know that you know it like
23:08
in reciprocally all the way down and um kind of the at least my experience with
23:13
Tesla is there's a set of actors out there on X etc who their strategic plan
23:20
is to actually deny common knowledge on the robo taxi business as in the math is
23:26
so dumb stupid and simple that this could be massively cash flow generative that they can't even acknowledge or
23:33
argue on that specific set of math because doing so would acknowledge that there's an option of huge value creation
23:39
here. And so instead they kind of deny that this whole thing exists and don't
23:45
engage kind of like with intellectual honesty in that discussion because then
23:50
it would force them to acknowledge that there's like a huge potential option value embedded in the stock. Now, they
23:57
can do that because there's no way to pin them on actually having to price it, right? Like there's no market that is
24:03
specific to that um subsegment of the business. And if there was, I think
24:09
actually what would happen broadly, not just on Tesla, but across equities is
24:14
you would actually get more efficient pricing of longer term events. And so
24:20
you would you would end up with actually equities more successfully discounting
24:25
the future um because you could extract out some of those longerterm
24:30
um value um uh pieces subsegments of a a
24:37
very complex kind of underlying company. Uh and so you would see you you would
24:42
you would basically like a very good kind of set of prediction markets wrapped around equities. Suddenly people
24:48
would be like, "Oh my gosh, multiples are going nuts here. Why are these companies trading much more expensively than they used to?" And it's because you
24:56
could you were actually efficiently pricing some of the longer term um option exposures that they have that
25:02
right now go unpriced because people are like, "Well, is it going to affect earnings in the next 12 months? If not, I'm not interested."
25:08
Yeah. All right. We we stumbled into talking Tesla, but we pulled ourselves back out.
25:14
I agree. I think the future I mean every it is I think it's interesting. It's one of those things we always come back to
25:20
is like how powerful these markets are going to be. Um and so we should think
25:27
more about that. Uh but that brings us to the ledger, our weekly prediction
25:33
market tally. So far none have resolved, but I think uh we're we're tracking
25:40
well. All right. This week I was very tempted I was very tempted to do this poly market one which was will any of
25:47
the Louve heist robbers be arrested by October 31st but I'm going to opt a different route
Will The Louvre Heist Team Be Caught By October 31st?
25:55
here because I think not betting advice. I think this is too easy. Most most art
26:01
crimes get solved years years after because as long as you're not trying to
26:06
sell it, it's pretty hard to get caught from What is their What is their strategy for monetizing the stuff? Do they extract
26:13
the jewels out of like the individual pieces and sell the raw jewels? It seems like that's that's probably easier than it in
26:20
college. we had is like the head of the FBI art crime division came to speak to us and he's like
26:26
it's very easy to steal things from museums because they're not really protecting things from that,
26:32
right? But it's like if you keep it, you're fine, but then why are you risking stealing it? But as soon as you
26:39
steal it, it's like the most likely buyer is going to be the FBI or international equivalent.
26:46
Uh, so the the topic we're going for, and Nick, we've we've touched on this
26:51
one before, but it's relevant because Apple just paid $140 $140 million a year
26:57
for broadcast rights for the next five years. Uh, close to doubling ESPN uh $85
Who Will Be The Formula 1 Champion?
27:04
million a year for F1 broadcast rights in the US. And things have started to
27:11
get interesting uh because you have Max Verstoppen coming back with a fury. And so the
27:19
question is F1 drivers champion. And do
27:25
you want me to share my screen so you can see these odds and and make your your picks? Yes. Yes. All right.
27:30
Wait, we each have to pick a champion? Yeah. Gosh. Okay. Got it. And it's pretty pretty even odds. Can
27:37
you see now? Yeah. Okay. Okay, so you've got uh Oscar Postri at 38%. You've got Verstoppen at
27:44
34 and Lando at 28%.
27:49
I'm going verstoppen. Same. I I Sam, we can't same side every day.
27:56
No, I'll I'll I'm going to long Lando. I think one McLaren has like a vested
28:02
incentive to have him win over Pastri because Pastri is kind of an a-hole and Lando is British. Uh, and two, like he
28:10
has points in hand versus Versappen. And uh, so I would rather just take the
28:15
points in hand, assume Pastry is going to continue to get screwed by his own team and uh, Lando for the win.
28:24
All right, there you have it. Nick, this is our redemption bet because we called Verstoppen way back. We did
28:29
and we never bought his we never bought his playing card when this show was only being done live
28:36
on public. So, redemption max. Is this is this is this like an NFT
28:42
playing card or is this a physical play? No, this was we we had a guest on who was running because memorabilia still
28:48
making quite a run, I would say. Um, but we were early to the trend. Nice job,
28:53
Nick. So, we had someone on to discuss the market there and we were looking and
28:59
there was a Max for stop and card and it's like everyone just assumed that Hamilton was going to take the season
29:05
and so we were debating whether or not to buy it and we did not and this and that was like the season where
29:12
he broke out. He Yeah, he broke out. Verstoen is so amazing like just in F1,
29:18
you know, you drive the identical car as your teammate. So mostly the teammates finish like within a couple places of
29:24
each other and then Verstoppen finishes first and whoever the other Red Bull driver finishes like 15th. It's it's
29:30
really he's uh a standard deviation better than any other driver. But that
29:35
also now you're making me feel feel good about our pick. Yeah. Yeah. Super match.
29:41
Well, yes. Or I mean it's so execution sensitive to Verstoen. seems like uh I
29:48
think higher risk that he's going to continue to win races. It's true. All he needs is one one
29:55
targeting, right? You get one driver to take him out. They get a little under
30:00
the table payment from Postri and then uh yeah, that's that. I do I do think Verstoen's also helped
30:06
that the other teams don't really like the McLaren team, so they're not going to do them any favors to I I think that
30:12
that's also true. All right, thank you everyone for joining us for this week of the brainstorm. We'll see everyone next
30:19
week. Thank you.
