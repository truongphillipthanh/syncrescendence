What a name. OK Computer is Kimi's new agentic mode that allows users to use their flagship model Kimi K2 to run tasks like web building, data analysis, and other multi-step tasks.

Kimmy is one of the frontier labs in
0:01
China that's becoming one of the hottest
0:03
AI labs that offer models like Kim K2.
0:06
And while Kimmy has been putting out
0:07
cutting edge AI models, they also
0:09
recently released a feature called OK
0:11
Computer. And whenever Frontier Labs
0:13
extend beyond just LLM innovation to
0:16
actually use their LLMs to release an
0:18
application, I'm all for it. It's sort
0:19
of like getting the OEM product for your
0:21
car instead of using an aftermarket
0:23
product. The release of Okay Computer to
0:25
me is Kimmy's demonstration of how you
0:27
can extend their flagship Kim K2 model
0:30
to an agentic mode. In other words,
0:32
while we certainly can use Kim K2 on
0:34
thirdparty applications like Cloud Code,
0:36
Codeex, and Klein, OK Computer is Kim's
0:39
demonstration of how a strong model like
0:41
Kim 2 can be used for agentic modes that
0:44
end up creating products that look
0:45
something like this. And honestly, I
0:47
would be doing a huge disservice if I
0:49
don't start out by addressing the name
0:51
Okay Computer in tribute to Radio Head's
0:53
album in 1997 where the album really
0:56
evokes the dystopic tension between
0:58
human emotion and machine intelligence,
1:00
which is a great reference from Kimmy,
1:01
especially when we think about vibe
1:03
coding where human emotion or vibe is
1:06
driving the machine intelligence to
1:07
build products. Okay, with that out of
1:09
the way, let's start by addressing the
1:11
why. In other words, why should I care
1:13
about the new feature from Kimmy? What's
1:15
really unique about OK Computer is the
1:17
combination of different components.
1:19
Kimmy sites that OK Computer is deep
1:21
search plus image generation plus
1:23
lovable indicating where the strengths
1:24
of OK Computers are in its ability to
1:27
actually run deep research as well as
1:29
natively generate images as part of its
1:31
abilities and also its ability to build
1:33
highquality sites. Let's start with an
1:35
example by prototyping something with
1:37
this prompt. Okay, computer, research
1:39
the YouTube channel at Caleb Wright's
1:41
code, and create a portfolio page
1:43
showcasing its top 10 most viewed
1:45
videos, each with a generated image,
1:47
summary, and content details. As you can
1:49
see, it creates a seven item task list.
1:52
And soon after, it goes and opens up my
1:54
YouTube channel and scrolls through the
1:56
page to find out what my videos look
1:57
like. And once it finishes viewing them
1:59
on the browser, it generated a JSON
2:01
script and reason through the data to
2:03
get the top 10 videos. And here's a
2:05
quick sidebyside to confirm that it not
2:07
only got them, but it also got the order
2:09
of the videos by most watched videos
2:11
correctly. Next, the app is actually
2:13
generating an image for each video based
2:15
on the content. In other words, it's
2:17
creating original and model images for
2:20
each of the videos I have to create a
2:21
portfolio for my top 10 videos. And as
2:23
you can see from the left, it generated
2:25
10 images where each video reflects the
2:28
content. The next phase actually goes
2:29
ahead and starts generating HTML files
2:32
and all the web components that's needed
2:33
to build out the site. And once the main
2:35
components are all done, it goes ahead
2:37
and creates pages for each of the top 10
2:39
videos. And after about 10 minutes, it
2:41
finished the task and shared a direct
2:43
link to the deployed site that I can
2:45
check out. And the landing page has a
2:47
really cool animation like this. And
2:48
when I go to the video section, it shows
2:50
me a portfolio of my top 10 videos on my
2:53
channel. It also shows when they were
2:55
released, how many views it has, and it
2:57
looks like it also generated keywords
2:58
for each of them. It also created a
3:00
brief about the creator section where it
3:02
shows you what it thinks my top three
3:04
strengths are, which is kind of cool. I
3:05
can also click through each card and
3:07
find out what the video is about and get
3:09
more details on it. What I was hoping to
3:11
see though is actually have a full
3:12
description of the content that's inside
3:15
the video, but it's likely that I just
3:16
wasn't explicit enough in my initial
3:18
prompt, or maybe that feature doesn't
3:20
exist just yet. All in all, I think Okay
3:22
Computer is a great mix of practicality,
3:25
strong reasoning, and reliability of the
3:27
product that is perfect for prototyping
3:28
new applications, as well as doing data
3:30
analysis and general tasks that require
3:33
multiple steps. And tasks like these
3:35
typically require you to borrow skill
3:36
sets from product managers, designers,
3:39
data analysts, and developers. But OK
3:41
Computer is a unified version of all of
3:43
that. To try out the product, you can go
3:45
to Kimy's website, kimmy.com, and the
3:47
chat mode is free. and trying out okay
3:49
computer feature.
