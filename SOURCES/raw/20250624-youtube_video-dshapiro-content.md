---

**Dalibor:** Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome or welcome back as the case might be. My name is Dalibor Petrovic. I'm your host to these Tectonic Conversations. Today I have a very special guest on a very important and very timely topic. I am thrilled to welcome David Shapiro. David, thank you very much for finding time to be with me and with us today.

**David:** Thank you so much for having me. It's a pleasure.

**Dalibor:** David is a technologist and a futurist, self-described AI maximalist, but for the purpose of this conversation David has emerged as the leading voice in a new movement that is focusing on post-labor economics. This drew my attention when I first came across David and his work about probably six months ago now. I had the pleasure of spending three decades in technology and the last two of those with the world's largest professional services firm as a senior partner. I came across some of the world's most successful and smartest business leaders and policymakers, and that actually helped me pay attention to what I first heard David say.

Since then, I've spent increasing amounts of time following and understanding the model that is emerging. I feel it is superbly important for all of us to actually be paying attention to what David has to say. Your hypothesis, David, and the emerging thesis and theory has helped put a face and name to the underlying observation, concern and angst that I feel—and I feel many are feeling—about what is actually happening out there in our society and in our economy.

The idea of this conversation was to provide an additional platform for you, David, to address audiences that would not have come across you yet, people who might be following me and my channel. For those who are interested, I would warmly invite you to think about how you might get involved and help this movement progress because I believe we are addressing here one of the most pertinent and serious questions that we will be facing in our societies going forward.

So now that I raised all the urgency to this, David, thank you very much for your time again. What is post-labor economy and why should we be caring about it?

**David:** Well thank you for the kind introduction. In the very shortest version, post-labor economics is the observation that productivity has been decoupling from labor inputs for quite a few decades now since about the 1950s. With the rise of more technologies—the so-called fourth industrial revolution where we have humanoid robots, artificial intelligence—we are seeing that accelerate a little bit as these new general-purpose technologies saturate and diffuse out into every sector. The writing on the wall that many feel is: what am I going to do for work?

That's why this framework was ultimately dubbed post-labor economics—because the anticipation is that we're heading towards a paradigm where most economic activity, dollar for dollar, is generated not by human inputs but by machine inputs. That's the overarching idea of post-labor economics.

**Dalibor:** So the idea is that as technology displaces work, what we can foresee is that we are now facing technology that can actually displace all different types of work to a point where we can see the horizon where there is no more work available for humans, mostly?

**David:** Certainly the lion's share of work is vulnerable to automation today. As most people know, we moved from an agrarian economy to a manufacturing economy, and now we're in a service-based economy. Well, service-based economies are predicated primarily on knowledge work. And artificial intelligence is getting smarter and better at reasoning and cognition and planning.

Just a few days before this recording, two labs—both OpenAI and Google—won gold medals on the International Math Olympiad,[^1] which is the most prestigious math competition in the world. This was not predicted by anyone to happen for another year or two. That kind of advanced schedule, that calendar where things happen faster than people anticipated, has been the norm in this space for the last few years.

When you look at the capabilities expanding, you say okay, well this frontier of automation—this is a term by Anton Korinek[^2] who's an economist who is a visiting fellow at IMF—he coined the term the frontier of automation and basically that says this is the sphere of which machines are capable of displacing human labor.

When you take those two facts—that the machines are getting smarter and we presently have a knowledge-based economy because something like 80% of jobs in developed economies such as America and Europe are service-based, knowledge work, retail, that sort of thing—that means the lion's share of jobs out there today could be vulnerable to being completely replaced or through a process called labor substitution. It could be substituted for machines here very soon, in very short order.

**Dalibor:** To help us address this, I know that you're working on publishing a book that contains six parts. These six parts are taking the concept from introducing the concept and proposing the challenge all the way through to some concrete ideas on what could individuals, organizations and nations do to address this situation. What I would like to do, David, is to walk through these six parts today with you one by one so that we can have a meaningful, robust conversation on each. I would also invite audiences who are following us live—if they have any questions to use the Q&A function of this platform and submit a question. So we're not going to be able to address questions on chat, but please if you have a question submit using Q&A.

Let's start at the beginning, at Part One, Chapter One, which is Rays of Automation. Can you sort of set us up with a basic understanding—where should people start?

**David:** The fundamental assertion here is that automation has been advancing for actually several centuries. For me personally, it really started with the printing press, the Gutenberg printing press in the 15th century, which cut down the amount of time that went into printing books by a factor of about 200. Instead of taking a year or two for each copy of a book, it took a couple weeks. Now, to be fair, setting up all the print faces took a couple years, but once you got it set up, you could easily print hundreds of the same book.

Advance forward, you have the first, second and third industrial revolutions which included steam power, mechanized power, diesel, internet and so on. So you have this long arc where humanity has been automating away tasks starting with strength and then advancing forward through various forms of cognition and dexterity.

What we're seeing now is that first we had mechanical muscle—things like the Spinning Jenny, the Cotton Gin, tractors, bulldozers, cranes—all these things that gave us mechanical muscle. We now have what's called artificial embodied intelligence or artificial general embodied intelligence, which is basically humanoid robots—mechanical dexterity. We also have artificial intelligence, which is mechanical cognition.

Those are the three pillars of what humans bring to an economy and to the labor force: our muscles—which humans are not particularly strong; our dexterity—which humans are actually fairly dexterous, we've got really good fingers and hands and we're bipedal and we can run, jump, climb; and then we have our cognition—which is basically our ability to think and reason and communicate and so on.

We have been automating, we've been creating machines that can do those tasks. The Spinning Jenny was for muscle, humanoid robots are for dexterity, and artificial intelligence is for cognition. As those three frontiers of automation all converge on human-level capability or beyond, that leaves humans with nothing economic to offer. And so this long arc of automation is the first piece of the puzzle.

Then you have the second piece which is the economic pressures. Because even if it's capable, there needs to be a reason to adopt it. The business reason for automation—any business decision is subject to a cost-benefit analysis. The cost-benefit analysis of automation really comes down to four metrics: better, faster, cheaper, safer. If machines can do something better, faster, cheaper and safer, then businesses will adopt them because profit is the metric by which they operate.

Those are the two pieces of rays of automation. You've got a couple centuries of technology advancement that has been creating these new mechanical capabilities—muscle, dexterity and cognition—and then you have this compelling economic reason to deploy them. That's rays of automation.

**Dalibor:** That's a helpful setup. Before we go to Part Two, I just want to make sure that I got the first part. So the three pillars of what we bring to labor arbitrage is our strength, our dexterity and our cognition. You're saying that strength already has been sort of essentially automated. We don't need human bodies to do heavy lifting anymore. Dexterity and cognition—cognition particularly is now being automated and that is a big part of the post-labor economics future that you see. Is that a good way to think about it?

**David:** Yeah, that's accurate. I will add one clarification. This is jumping ahead a little bit, but there is one component that is not on that list which is empathy. Empathy is a really important emotional intelligence trait. It actually overlaps with cognitive intelligence a little bit, but it's also a distinct thing. Because humans are social animals, we need to feel connections to each other. Even if we invent a machine that is capable of empathy—and there are some ways that you could measure that—humans are probably still going to prefer humans.

In terms of economic viability, machines are rapidly approaching parity with humans in terms of strength, dexterity and cognition. Empathy is the one where it's going to be stickier and take longer. That's my personal prediction.

**Dalibor:** So that's a good segue. I want to make sure—if we imagine a timeline, if you were to sort of put it roughly, where are we on that timeline for the three that we talked about: strength, dexterity and cognition?

**David:** Well, strength has been saturated for decades. That's basically done. When it comes to dexterity, we're starting to see more and more demos where humanoid robots are capable of very delicate tasks like folding laundry or doing other very delicate manufacturing tasks. The economic viability of humanoid robots—Tesla's Optimus is a good benchmark. They are anticipating full deployment inside Tesla factories within the next year or two. And then they'll be making them to sell. Right now they cost about $30,000 to make. Their expectation is that the price will come down to about $10,000 to $20,000 within five years.

When you look at a humanoid robot that costs $10,000 or $20,000 and you can have it work 24/7 and it's got basically a lifespan of about 10 years, that comes out to somewhere between 50 cents and $2 an hour—way cheaper than human labor. The breakeven point for humanoid robots is when they hit that $20,000 to $30,000 price range and they're capable of doing the work and they don't break down so much that it costs more to fix them than it does to just hire a person. That's the economic calculus.

The prediction—and I tend to track the most optimistic predictions because those tend to track most accurately in this space—so fully saturated humanoid robot deployment across major developed economies, call it 2030. It's about five years from now. Some predictions are 10 or 15 years. I always track the most optimistic ones because those tend to be closer to reality.

Then you've got cognition, which is the big one. The International Math Olympiad win that happened this week is a big deal because it shows that AI systems are now capable of complex multi-step reasoning at a level that is approaching or at a gold medal level for humans. That signals that we're very close to what's called artificial general intelligence or AGI, which is basically an AI that can do any cognitive task that a human can.

My personal prediction is that we will have AGI—defined as an AI system that can do 95% or more of all economically valuable cognitive tasks at human level or better—within two to three years. That would be 2027 to 2028. Some people say it's going to take 10 years. I don't think so. I think it's going to be much sooner than that.

**Dalibor:** That's helpful. Let's now go to Part Two of your book, which I believe is about economic decoupling. Can you explain what is this concept of economic decoupling?

**David:** Economic decoupling is the observation that productivity and GDP growth have been decoupling from labor inputs since about the 1950s. What that means is that the economy—measured in terms of goods and services produced, measured in dollars—has been growing, but the percentage of that growth that is attributable to human labor has been shrinking.

This is actually well-documented in economic literature. There are several metrics. One is labor share of income, which is the percentage of GDP that goes to workers in the form of wages. That has been declining since the 1970s in most developed economies. Another metric is labor productivity growth, which is output per hour worked. That's been going up, but wages have not been keeping pace.

The fundamental observation is that as machines get better at doing work, the economic value created by machines goes up and the economic value created by humans goes down relatively speaking. This has been happening for decades. The prediction is that it's going to accelerate dramatically over the next 5 to 10 years as AI and robotics mature.

The way to think about this is imagine a pie chart of GDP. Right now, human labor accounts for maybe 60% to 70% of GDP. Machine capital—factories, computers, tractors, everything—accounts for the other 30% to 40%. As machines get better, that ratio is going to flip. Eventually you could see a world where machines account for 90% or 95% of GDP and humans account for only 5% or 10%.

That's what economic decoupling is. It's the separation of economic productivity from human labor inputs. This has profound implications for how we think about work, income, wealth distribution and the social contract.

**Dalibor:** So if I understand correctly, this decoupling has been happening for a while, but the pace of it is about to accelerate dramatically because of AI and robotics?

**David:** Exactly. The long-term trend has been there for decades. What's changing now is the rate of change. We're approaching what I call an inflection point where the rate at which machines are displacing human labor is about to go exponential or at least quasi-exponential.

There are a few reasons for this. One is that AI is a general-purpose technology. Unlike a tractor which can only do farming tasks, or unlike a computer which can only do computational tasks, AI can do reasoning, planning, communication, problem-solving across virtually any domain. That makes it much more broadly applicable.

The second reason is that AI scales very differently than human labor. If you want to double your workforce, you need to recruit, train and pay twice as many people. If you want to double your AI capacity, you just buy more servers or run more instances. The marginal cost approaches zero.

The third reason is network effects and economies of scale. As AI gets better, it gets deployed more widely. As it gets deployed more widely, more data is generated, which makes the AI better, which leads to more deployment. You get this virtuous cycle that accelerates adoption.

All of those factors together mean that we're not just looking at a linear continuation of the trend we've seen for the last 50 years. We're looking at a sharp acceleration of that trend over the next 5 to 10 years. That's what makes this moment in history so significant.

**Dalibor:** That's a very important distinction. Let's move to Part Three, which I believe is about market dynamics and mechanisms. What are the key concepts here?

**David:** Part Three is really about understanding how markets work and why markets left to their own devices will not solve the post-labor problem. This is where I differ from some economists who say "don't worry, the market will figure it out, new jobs will be created."

The fundamental issue is what I call the demand-side problem. For an economy to function, you need both supply and demand. Supply is the production of goods and services. Demand is the consumption of goods and services. For markets to clear—meaning for supply and demand to balance—you need people who have purchasing power.

Traditionally, people get purchasing power through labor. They work, they earn wages, they spend those wages, and that creates demand for goods and services. But if automation displaces human labor, then people don't have wages, which means they don't have purchasing power, which means there's no demand, which means markets don't clear.

This is what's called the underconsumption problem or the demand-side crisis. It's been theorized about for a long time. John Maynard Keynes wrote about this in the 1930s. He talked about "technological unemployment" being a major challenge. The difference is that in Keynes's time, automation was only displacing muscle. Now automation is displacing cognition too.

The market mechanism that typically solves this is job creation. When one industry automates, people move to another industry. But if automation is happening across all industries simultaneously, there's nowhere to move to. That's the challenge.

There are a few other market dynamics I cover in Part Three. One is the concentration of wealth. As machines do more of the work, the owners of those machines—the capital owners—capture more of the economic gains. Labor gets a smaller share. This leads to wealth concentration, which exacerbates the demand-side problem because wealthy people have a lower marginal propensity to consume.

Another dynamic is what I call the race to the bottom. As businesses compete to adopt automation to cut costs, they create a competitive dynamic where everyone has to automate or they'll be priced out of the market. This creates a prisoner's dilemma where individually rational decisions lead to collectively suboptimal outcomes.

The final piece is the social and political instability that results from all of this. When large numbers of people are unemployed or underemployed, that creates social unrest, political extremism and potential for conflict. We've seen this historically. The Great Depression led to the rise of fascism in Europe. Economic anxiety today is fueling populism around the world.

Part Three is really about understanding that markets, while incredibly powerful and efficient, are not designed to solve certain types of problems—particularly problems involving the distribution of purchasing power in a post-labor economy. That's why we need intentional policy interventions, which is what Parts Four, Five and Six address.

**Dalibor:** This is a critical point. You're essentially saying that the invisible hand of the market will not solve this problem on its own. We need intentional intervention. Before we get to the solutions, let me ask you about Part Four, which I believe is about rights of economic agency. Can you explain this framework?

**David:** This is one of the most important conceptual frameworks in the whole book. The idea of rights of economic agency is that for individuals to participate in an economy and have a say in how the economy is governed, they need certain fundamental rights. I've identified four pillars of economic agency: labor rights, property rights, democratic rights and algorithmic rights.

Labor rights are the traditional foundation of economic agency in capitalist societies. These include the right to work, the right to organize, the right to fair wages, the right to safe working conditions. The idea is that if you can sell your labor, you have economic agency—you can participate in the economy and you have leverage to negotiate for better conditions.

Property rights are the second pillar. These include the right to own assets, the right to accumulate wealth, the right to inherit wealth, the right to transact freely. Property rights give you economic agency through capital rather than through labor.

Democratic rights are the third pillar. These include the right to vote, the right to free speech, the right to participate in governance. Democratic rights give you political agency, which translates to economic agency through your ability to shape policy.

The fourth pillar, which is new to this framework, is algorithmic rights. These include the right to transparency in how algorithms make decisions about you, the right to consent to how your data is used, the right to appeal algorithmic decisions, the right to understand the logic behind AI systems that affect your life.

The argument I make in Part Four is that labor rights are eroding because labor is being displaced by automation. If labor rights can no longer provide economic agency for most people, then we need to strengthen the other three pillars to compensate.

Property rights need to be expanded so that more people have access to capital ownership. Democratic rights need to be defended and strengthened so that people can shape policy even if they're not employed. And algorithmic rights need to be established as a new category of rights for the AI age.

This is the conceptual foundation for all the policy proposals that come in Parts Five and Six. The goal is to ensure that everyone has economic agency—the ability to participate in the economy and have a say in how it's governed—even in a world where most work is done by machines.

**Dalibor:** This is fascinating. So you're essentially proposing that we need to shift from a labor-based economic agency to a more diversified model that includes property, democracy and algorithmic rights. Can you give some concrete examples of what strengthening these other pillars might look like?

**David:** Absolutely. Let's take property rights first. The most straightforward way to strengthen property rights is through some form of universal basic capital or universal basic ownership. The idea is that if machines are creating most of the economic value, then everyone should have ownership stakes in those machines.

One model for this is a sovereign wealth fund that owns shares in major corporations and distributes dividends to all citizens. Alaska has something like this with the Alaska Permanent Fund, which pays out annual dividends from oil revenues. Norway has a similar model with their Government Pension Fund. You could extend this concept to create a national or global fund that owns shares in the companies that are automating the economy.

Another model is universal basic income, but funded through capital returns rather than through taxation of labor. If you tax corporate profits or wealth and redistribute that as UBI, you're effectively giving everyone a property stake in the automated economy.

A more radical model is what I call the Commons Dividend. The idea is that certain resources—data, natural resources, public infrastructure, even the economy itself—are part of the commons and belong to everyone. As those resources generate value through automation, everyone should get a dividend from that value creation.

For democratic rights, strengthening this pillar means defending and expanding democratic participation. This includes things like making it easier to vote, reducing the influence of money in politics, increasing transparency in government, empowering local and regional governance, and potentially exploring new models of participatory democracy enabled by technology.

One specific proposal I'm interested in is what I call democratic auditing of AI systems. The idea is that major AI systems—particularly those used by governments or those that have significant social impact—should be subject to democratic oversight. Citizens should have the ability to audit these systems, understand how they work and have a say in how they're deployed.

For algorithmic rights, this is about establishing new legal frameworks for the AI age. This includes things like the right to explanation—if an AI makes a decision that affects you, you have the right to understand why. The right to human review—if an AI denies you a loan or a job, you have the right to appeal to a human. The right to data portability—you own your data and you can take it with you. The right to algorithmic transparency—companies have to disclose how their AI systems work.

The European Union's AI Act is a step in this direction. It establishes different risk categories for AI systems and requires transparency and accountability for high-risk applications. We need more frameworks like this, but also more ambitious ones that really give individuals meaningful agency over how AI affects their lives.

**Dalibor:** This is a comprehensive framework. Let's now move to Part Five, which I assume starts to get into concrete solutions. What are the key proposals here?

**David:** Part Five is about solutions at the individual level. The question is: if you're a person living through this transition, what should you be doing? How should you be thinking about your career, your skills, your financial planning?

The first thing I emphasize is that this is not about trying to compete with machines. You're not going to out-compute an AI or out-lift a robot. The goal is to focus on areas where humans have enduring comparative advantage.

I've identified five key skill areas that I think will remain valuable even as automation advances. The first is communication. Humans are social animals. We need to communicate with each other, build relationships, negotiate, persuade. AI can help with communication, but the human element is still critical, especially in high-stakes situations.

The second is creativity. Not just artistic creativity, but creative problem-solving, thinking outside the box, making novel connections. AI can be creative in certain ways, but human creativity is still distinctive, especially when it comes to understanding human needs and desires.

The third is empathy and emotional intelligence. This is what we talked about earlier. Humans are going to prefer interacting with other humans in situations that require emotional connection, care, understanding. This includes things like therapy, teaching, elder care, customer service in high-value contexts.

The fourth is strategic thinking and judgment. AI can analyze vast amounts of data and make recommendations, but humans still need to make the final decisions, especially in situations involving ethics, values, trade-offs. This is particularly true for leadership roles.

The fifth is adaptability and learning. The world is going to be changing very rapidly. The people who succeed will be those who can learn new things quickly, adapt to new circumstances, reinvent themselves as needed.

In terms of specific career advice, I generally recommend that people focus on roles that combine several of these skills. For example, a teacher who uses AI tools but focuses on mentoring and emotional support. A designer who uses AI to generate options but applies human judgment and creativity to select and refine. A manager who uses AI analytics but focuses on team building and strategic decision-making.

The other major piece of Part Five is financial planning. Even if you have a stable job today, you should be preparing for a world where labor income is uncertain. That means building up savings, investing in assets that generate passive income, learning about financial markets, potentially starting a business or developing side income streams.

I also recommend what I call strategic positioning. Think about where you want to be geographically, socially, economically when this transition happens. If you're in a major city with a strong social safety net, you might be in a better position than if you're in a rural area with limited services. If you're well-connected with a strong social network, you'll be more resilient than if you're isolated.

The final piece is psychological preparation. This transition is going to be difficult for a lot of people. There's going to be a lot of anxiety, uncertainty, loss of identity. I recommend that people start thinking about how they derive meaning and purpose outside of work. What are your hobbies? What are your relationships? What are your values? What would you do if you didn't have to work?

This gets to a framework I borrow from psychology called Self-Determination Theory or SDT. It says that human well-being depends on three things: competence (feeling like you're good at something), autonomy (feeling like you have control over your life) and relatedness (feeling connected to others).

In a post-labor world, you're not going to get competence and autonomy from your job because most people won't have jobs. So you need to find other sources. This could be hobbies, volunteer work, artistic pursuits, community involvement, learning new skills. The key is to start cultivating these things now so that you have a foundation when the transition happens.

**Dalibor:** This is incredibly practical advice. I want to make sure I understand the SDT framework correctly. You're saying that in a post-labor world, people will need to find competence, autonomy and relatedness outside of traditional employment. Can you give some concrete examples of what that might look like?

**David:** Absolutely. Let me give you a few scenarios.

For competence, this could be mastering a craft or skill. Maybe you become an excellent woodworker, or you get really good at playing an instrument, or you become a skilled gardener. It doesn't have to be economically valuable—in a post-labor world, economic value is less important. What matters is that you feel like you're developing mastery over something.

It could also be intellectual competence. Maybe you become very knowledgeable about history or science or philosophy. You read extensively, you write, you discuss ideas with others. In a world with abundant material resources and lots of leisure time, intellectual pursuits could become much more central to how people spend their time.

For autonomy, this is about having control over your own life and making your own choices. In the current world, a lot of people feel like they don't have autonomy because they're dependent on their employer and they have to do what the boss says. In a post-labor world with UBI or some other form of guaranteed income, you'd have much more autonomy over how you spend your time.

The challenge is that autonomy can be paralyzing if you don't have structure or purpose. So part of developing autonomy is learning how to self-direct, how to set your own goals, how to manage your own time. This is a skill that a lot of people don't have because they've always had external structure imposed on them through work or school.

For relatedness, this is about social connections and community. In the current world, a lot of people get their social connections through work. Your coworkers are your friends, your work defines your social identity. In a post-labor world, you need to find other sources of social connection.

This could be family, it could be neighborhood community, it could be hobby groups, it could be online communities, it could be volunteer organizations. The key is to cultivate meaningful relationships that aren't dependent on employment status.

One model I find interesting is the idea of purpose-driven communities. These are groups of people who come together around a shared mission or cause. Maybe it's environmental conservation, or supporting the arts, or advancing scientific knowledge, or helping the disadvantaged. These communities give people a sense of purpose and belonging even without traditional employment.

Another model is what I call the guild model. Historically, guilds were associations of craftspeople who shared knowledge, maintained standards, provided mutual support. You could imagine modern equivalents—communities of makers, communities of artists, communities of thinkers—that provide structure and identity in a post-labor world.

The bottom line is that humans need these three things—competence, autonomy, relatedness—to be happy and fulfilled. Work has traditionally provided all three, but it doesn't have to be the only source. We need to start thinking about how to get these needs met through other means.

**Dalibor:** This is profound. You're essentially describing a shift in how we think about human flourishing and the good life. Let's now move to Part Six, which I assume is about systemic and policy-level solutions?

**David:** Exactly. Part Six is where I lay out the policy agenda for navigating the post-labor transition. This is organized at three levels: individual, organizational and national or global.

We've already covered individual-level solutions in Part Five. At the organizational level, I'm talking about what businesses and institutions need to do to adapt to this transition.

For businesses, the key is to think beyond just maximizing shareholder value and start thinking about stakeholder value. If you're a company that's automating away jobs, you have a responsibility to the workers who are being displaced. This could mean providing generous severance packages, funding retraining programs, offering transition support.

Some companies are already doing this. AT&T, for example, has invested over $1 billion in retraining their workforce as they've automated various functions. That's the kind of corporate responsibility we need to see more of.

Another organizational-level intervention is what I call job sharing or work sharing. Instead of laying off half your workforce because you've automated half the work, you could keep everyone employed but have them work half-time. This spreads the available work around and maintains people's connection to the labor market even as the total amount of work shrinks.

At the national and global level, the policy interventions get more ambitious. The core challenge is how to ensure that everyone has economic security and purchasing power in a world where labor income is no longer sufficient.

The most straightforward solution is universal basic income. This is a regular cash payment to all citizens, no strings attached, no means testing, no work requirements. It's funded through taxation—typically wealth taxes, corporate profit taxes, land value taxes, carbon taxes or some combination.

There are several pilot programs and experiments with UBI happening around the world. The results generally show positive outcomes: people don't stop working, they use the money to invest in education or start businesses, their health and well-being improves, children do better in school.

The main challenges with UBI are political will and funding. It's expensive, and there's a lot of resistance to the idea of giving people money for nothing. But I think as automation advances and the unemployment crisis becomes more acute, UBI will become politically inevitable.

Another policy intervention is what I call universal basic services. Instead of giving people cash, you provide free or heavily subsidized access to essential services: healthcare, education, housing, transportation, internet. This ensures that everyone's basic needs are met regardless of their income.

Some countries already do this to varying degrees. Nordic countries provide extensive public services. Singapore has excellent public housing. Cuba has good healthcare and education despite being poor. The idea is to expand this model so that everyone has access to a decent standard of living.

A third approach is job guarantees. The government acts as employer of last resort, offering a job to anyone who wants one. These could be public service jobs: infrastructure maintenance, environmental restoration, care work, community development. The wage would be set at a living wage level, which would also establish a wage floor for private sector jobs.

Job guarantees have some advantages over UBI. They maintain the dignity and social connection of work. They produce public goods that benefit everyone. They're easier to sell politically because people are earning their money rather than receiving handouts.

The downside is that they don't fully address the post-labor problem. If machines can do most work better, faster, cheaper and safer, then make-work jobs are inefficient and potentially demeaning. I see job guarantees as a transitional policy that might be useful in the near term but won't be the long-term solution.

Another set of policies revolves around wealth redistribution and capital ownership. This includes progressive wealth taxes, estate taxes, capital gains taxes. The revenue from these taxes can fund UBI or UBS or other social programs.

More ambitiously, you could have policies that democratize capital ownership. Employee stock ownership plans, sovereign wealth funds, public ownership of key industries. The idea is that if machines are creating the wealth, then everyone should have a stake in those machines.

One specific proposal I like is what's called a social dividend or a national dividend. This is similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund. You create a fund that owns shares in major corporations or collects revenue from natural resources or data or other commons assets. The fund pays out dividends to all citizens. Over time, as automation increases productivity, the dividend grows and eventually becomes large enough to provide a comfortable living.

There are also policies around corporate governance and accountability. If companies are automating away jobs, they should be required to report on the social impact of their automation decisions. There could be automation taxes where companies pay a fee for each job they eliminate. The revenue funds transition support for displaced workers.

Some people worry that automation taxes would slow down progress or drive businesses overseas. I think these concerns are overblown. The competitive advantage of automation is so large that companies will adopt it even with moderate taxes. And if we coordinate these policies internationally, then there's no race to the bottom.

Another important policy area is education. Our current education system is designed to prepare people for industrial age jobs. We need to redesign it for a post-labor world. That means less focus on job training and more focus on critical thinking, creativity, emotional intelligence, citizenship, personal development.

It also means lifelong learning. In a world where technology is changing rapidly, people need to be able to learn and adapt continuously throughout their lives. This requires accessible, affordable, flexible education opportunities for people of all ages.

Finally, there are international and global governance issues. Automation is happening globally. The benefits and disruptions are not evenly distributed. We need international cooperation to ensure that developing countries aren't left behind and that global supply chains remain stable during the transition.

This could include things like global minimum standards for labor rights and social protection, international taxation agreements to prevent tax havens and profit shifting, coordinated research and development on beneficial AI, global governance frameworks for AI safety and ethics.

The challenge is that international cooperation is difficult, especially in an era of rising nationalism and geopolitical tension. But the stakes are high enough that I think countries will eventually realize they need to work together.

**Dalibor:** This is a comprehensive policy agenda. Let me ask you about implementation. These are ambitious proposals that would require significant political will. How do you see this actually happening? What's the pathway from here to there?

**David:** That's the million-dollar question. The honest answer is I don't know exactly how this happens. But I can sketch out a few possible pathways.

The first is what I call crisis-driven reform. We've seen this historically. The New Deal happened because of the Great Depression. The social safety net in Europe was built after World War II. Major reforms typically happen when things get bad enough that the political will emerges.

If we see large-scale unemployment, social unrest, political instability as a result of automation, that could create the crisis that forces action. The danger, of course, is that things could get very bad before they get better. We could see a lot of suffering, we could see political extremism, we could even see conflict or collapse.

My hope is that we can be more proactive—that we can see what's coming and take action before the crisis hits. That's the second pathway: anticipatory reform. This requires political leaders, business leaders, civil society organizations and citizens to take the post-labor problem seriously and start implementing solutions now.

There are some signs of this happening. The debate over UBI has become much more mainstream. Several countries have run UBI pilots. Organizations like the IMF and the World Bank are studying automation and its economic impacts. The European Union is developing AI regulations.

But I'd say we're still in the early stages. Most political leaders are not yet treating this as the urgent priority it needs to be. That's why advocacy and awareness-raising are so important. The more people understand the post-labor problem, the more pressure there will be on policymakers to act.

The third pathway is bottom-up innovation. Even without government action, we could see businesses, communities and individuals developing their own solutions. Cooperatives, mutual aid networks, local currencies, time banks, community land trusts—there are lots of grassroots economic models that could provide resilience during the transition.

The open-source movement is a good example. People create valuable software and share it freely, not for profit but for the satisfaction of contributing and being part of a community. In a post-labor world with abundant material resources, we might see more of this kind of gift economy or reputation economy.

Another example is the maker movement. People have workshops where they share tools and knowledge and help each other build things. This creates economic value outside the traditional market system and also provides the competence, autonomy and relatedness that we talked about earlier.

My guess is that the actual transition will involve some combination of all three pathways. We'll have some crisis-driven reforms when things get bad. We'll have some anticipatory policy action from forward-thinking governments. And we'll have lots of bottom-up innovation as people and communities adapt to the new reality.

The key is to start preparing now. That means researching these ideas, testing them in pilot programs, building the political coalitions to support them, developing the institutional capacity to implement them. The more groundwork we lay now, the smoother the transition will be when it happens.

**Dalibor:** David, I want to ask you about the timeline for all of this. You mentioned earlier that you expect AGI within two to three years and humanoid robots to be economically viable within five years. What does the actual labor market disruption look like? Is this a sudden shock or a gradual transition?

**David:** This is one of the hardest things to predict because it depends on so many factors: the pace of technological development, the rate of business adoption, regulatory responses, social and political reactions.

My base case scenario is that we're going to see a fairly rapid transition compressed into about 10 to 15 years. We're already seeing the early stages now with chatbots, AI coding assistants, automated customer service. Over the next few years, we'll see more and more knowledge work being automated: legal research, medical diagnosis, financial analysis, content creation.

By the late 2020s, I expect we'll see significant white-collar job displacement. This is going to be a shock for a lot of people because white-collar workers generally have more economic security and political influence than blue-collar workers. When lawyers and accountants and middle managers start losing their jobs en masse, that's going to create political pressure for action.

Then in the early 2030s, as humanoid robots become economically viable, we'll see blue-collar job displacement accelerate. Manufacturing, warehousing, construction, agriculture—all of these sectors will automate rapidly.

By the mid-2030s, we could be in a situation where 40% to 50% of current jobs have been automated. That's when the economic and social crisis really hits. Unless we've implemented major policy interventions by that point, we're going to see mass unemployment, plummeting consumer demand, economic stagnation or contraction, social unrest.

The hope is that we use the next 10 years to build the policy frameworks and institutions we need to manage this transition. If we do that, then by the 2040s we could be in a new equilibrium where most work is done by machines, most people have economic security through UBI or other mechanisms, and humans are freed up to pursue meaning and purpose in other ways.

That's the optimistic scenario. The pessimistic scenario is that we don't take action in time, we hit a major crisis in the 2030s, and we spend decades dealing with the fallout before we eventually find our way to a new equilibrium.

The really pessimistic scenario is that we never find a stable equilibrium and we end up in a dystopian situation with extreme wealth inequality, authoritarian control, social breakdown. I don't think that's likely, but it's possible if we make really bad choices.

**Dalibor:** That's sobering. Let me ask you about geographic variation. You mentioned earlier that this will hit developed economies first. How do you see this playing out differently in different parts of the world?

**David:** This is a great question and it's something I've been thinking about more recently. The conventional wisdom is that automation will hit developed economies first because they have higher labor costs and more capital to invest in automation. Developing economies with cheap labor would be affected later.

I actually think this might not be correct, or at least it's more complicated than that. For cognitive automation—AI—I think the effect is going to be fairly global and fairly rapid. AI doesn't cost much to deploy. You can run sophisticated AI models in the cloud for a few cents an hour. That means even developing economies with low labor costs could see rapid adoption of AI for knowledge work.

In fact, developing economies might be more vulnerable in some ways because they often have large service sectors focused on things like call centers, data entry, basic IT services. These are exactly the kinds of jobs that are most vulnerable to AI automation.

For physical automation—robots—I do think developed economies will be affected first. The capital costs are higher and the labor savings are less compelling in places where labor is already cheap. But as I mentioned earlier, the cost of humanoid robots is coming down fast. Within 10 years, they could be cheap enough to be economically viable even in the poorest parts of the world.

There's another factor which is that automation doesn't necessarily happen where the labor is. If a company in the US automates manufacturing and moves production back from China to the US with robots, that affects workers in China even though the robots are deployed in the US. This is called reshoring, and it could be a major trend over the next decade.

The other thing to consider is that developing economies often have less robust social safety nets and weaker institutions. When jobs are displaced, the social and economic consequences could be more severe. This could lead to instability, migration pressures, conflict.

On the flip side, developing economies are often more flexible and adaptive. They're used to dealing with disruption and uncertainty. They have strong informal economies and social networks. These assets could be valuable in navigating the transition.

My overall take is that automation is going to be a global phenomenon. The timing and specific impacts will vary by region, but no one is going to be insulated from it. That's why international cooperation is so important. We need to be thinking about global solutions, not just national ones.

**Dalibor:** David, this has been a fantastic conversation. I've learned a lot. I know we're approaching the two-hour mark that we planned for, so I want to be respectful of your time. Might I just maybe call out some of the things that I think are important to remember from this conversation?

First, we are in the middle of a decoupling of labor with productivity and that's driving the conversation of what do we do as humanity? How do we deal with this so that we end up in a better state? Because the other option could be truly catastrophic.

What we bring as humans to labor arbitrage is essentially strength, dexterity, cognition, intelligence and empathy. Strength has already been automated. We are now in the process of automation of dexterity and cognition and that is going to be eroding fast. The last vestige that will stay on will probably be empathy.

Another framework you brought was the fact that automation happens any time when automation can do anything better, faster, cheaper and safer. And we are now in this situation where systems actually are—or imminently or in the near term could be—better, faster, cheaper and safer on many jobs that could now be automated.

You introduced the concept of rights of economic agency, and economic agency that includes labor rights, property rights, democratic rights. The discussion is that labor rights are eroding as we discussed. So therefore other rights need to stand up to supplement it if we were to preserve quality of living—namely the property rights. We should be strengthening democratic rights and perhaps introducing a new pillar around the algorithmic rights.

You also mentioned regarding the future, what are the skill sets that people need to be aware of and sharpening? You said number one is communication, number two authenticity, number three empathy. I might add curiosity and resilience would be superbly helpful in that package.

And then what you also introduced is the SDT model or framework that helps people think about what might they be doing with themselves at the point when they find themselves in a comfortable non-labor arbitrage situation. You said focus on your competence and mastery, achieve autonomy, and relationships—those are the three things that are really important.

David, I would like to give you a closing note or closing remarks and then we can end. Over to you.

**David:** Well, Dalibor, thank you so much for the time and attention, and for everyone who's tuned in. It really means a lot to me. I think I'll end on a more personal note.

This entire framework I've been working on for the last couple years—it always makes progress whenever people poke holes in it. They say, "Well, what about this?" And sometimes it can be frustrating when someone says, "Well, how do you do it peacefully?" or "What about the developing world?" But every time someone asks those "what about" questions, the whole thing gets better and stronger.

It has been a collaborative process between me and peers and colleagues, but also my audience. I try and read every comment, and even if it's a comment that I don't see, I actually hoover up all the comments that people talk about post-labor economics with the help of AI. So I get a lot of feedback from across the entire world about this framework.

If you're excited about it, if you have questions, if you have pushback, if you have feedback, post it anywhere—post it on LinkedIn, post it on any social media. I'll eventually see it and that's one of the easiest ways that anyone can contribute and anyone can help.

Now what I will caution—there is an asterisk—which is that some of the questions, some of the common questions are already addressed in the framework, but you'll have to wait for the book to come out, *The Great Decoupling*. The drafting should be done in a month or two, and then it's just a matter of the publishing cycle and you'll be able to get your hands on it.

That's all I got. Thank you so much.

**Dalibor:** Thank you. And my invitation to everybody is to join the movement, to find David's work. David is very active on YouTube and has a massive and increasing following—as you would have seen, no surprise why. You also started on LinkedIn and have a Substack. So there are multiple ways to get engaged, to follow your work and to contribute to your work, like the little part that I'm doing.

With that, David, thank you very much. This has been recorded indeed and very soon we'll be posting it both on Tectonic Conversations, but also David will post it on his channel as well. So with that, thank you very much and have yourself a wonderful Wednesday.
