Hello everyone and welcome to today's webinar. Uh my name is Tippiso and I am
0:36
the marketing assistant from the Engineering Institute of Technology. I'd like to welcome you all to today's
0:43
webinar. It proves to be different as well as exciting. Uh if this is your
0:49
regular and you always attend the webinars, please note that this one is going to be a little bit different. Uh
0:55
however, it's just going to be as enjoyable uh as you all note. So I'm
1:00
going to skip the formalities of the day uh so that we get right into the business of it. I would like to mention
1:07
that you are going to receive a recording as well as the copy of the slides uh for this particular webinar as
1:13
per norm uh and you can as well as receive a certificate of attendance.
1:18
Please note that we will send them in about two business days. Please make sure to monitor uh your email inboxes so
1:25
that you are aware uh where you'll receive them. So today's webinar presentation uh is going to be quite
1:32
exciting. we have professor Hank Vaniel. Uh he is actually a professor and an
1:38
industrial 4.0 originator and strategist. So he's going to be taking
1:44
us through this particular webinar. All I need for you guys to do for me right now is actually confirm that you can
1:50
hear and see me clearly so that when the professor takes over the slides and uploads his presentation uh we know that
1:57
you are able to hear and see us clearly. As I've mentioned, the certificate of attendance and information pertaining to
2:04
it will be shared as perm and I'll do so at the end of the webinar. Any questions, please make sure that you
2:10
also leave them in the chat box or Q&A function. Uh, and then let's just get into the business of things. Could I
2:17
please have a thumbs up uh if you can hear and see me clearly.
2:23
Thank you so much. Much appreciated. Thank you so much, DSA. Uh, Professor
2:29
Henrik, you may go ahead and upload your slides as well as your presentation for the day. Uh, and I will do uh, the
2:36
business of the day, which is answer any questions that come through and wait for the post Q&A session so that you are
2:41
able to answer uh, our participants for the day. Thank you so much guys for attending. I will see you at the end of
2:47
the presentation.
2:56
Hello. Hello everybody. As you all here, I'm excited to be with
3:02
you together for the next 45 minutes. I think it's a good idea you use the thumbs thumbs up because I will ask
3:08
rhetorical questions or if you like something, take some screenshot of it, share it. Some of it will be new for
3:14
you. I'm a professor in economics and a professor in strategy. I teach at two
3:19
universities on engineering and my big passion is actually um focusing on the
3:25
future of engineering because co the core and the heart of the fourth
3:31
industrial revolution which I will go through I will go through a little bit about your capabilities development in
3:37
terms of what is changing in um in your cross competencies that you need to comply or apply in the next couple of
3:44
years as engineers and how the discipline is changing then I will talk a little bit about um some of the key
3:51
mega trends that are in energy in manufacturing and supply chain and then I'll open up for question. This will be
4:00
um um a speedy and interactive session. So the first element I want to focus on
4:07
is you and I will um start with that because the centerpiece of the fourth
4:13
industrial revolutions are you as people and that's why I'm
4:18
introducing the fourth industrial revolution on how it's actually working and I will come to that actually in the
4:25
middle of the fourth industrial revolution. I will I will focus on it based on what are we in which situation
4:31
are we now. So, do anybody of you feel that the world is in changing in all
4:38
sides and corners?
4:44
That should be a thumbs up. If you feel the world is changing. If you don't feel the world is changing, that's a thumbs
4:49
down. Do you think it's changing more than
4:54
traditional? So can you all see my screen?
5:06
Yes, we can see your screen professor. Perfect. Because then I'm actually just see the situation we are in today is
5:13
that we are in something called the third um the third the fourth wave of
5:19
the fourth industrial revolution. So what you're seeing now is mega trends colliding together and as trends collide
5:26
together they creating um a paradigm shift and a paradigm shift is something
5:32
that happens rare. I know marketing they use the term a lot but a paradigm shift
5:38
happens quite rarely and um when a paradigm shift hits it hits the water
5:44
and everything around it changes and in the economic revolution the biggest
5:49
change is in three different waves. So um we are going through right now a
5:55
monitoring reset system. So we have a monitoring system which is the central
6:00
banking system. We have the stock market system and we have the real economy. These three econ economies are not
6:08
related to each other. So you all feel inflation coming. You all feel the stock
6:14
markets the richer get richer. But your own economy in terms of your inflation
6:19
rate minimum within the last two years your inflation rate your buying power
6:24
has decreased by 10%. What you actually experience is there's an economic power shift towards the east and the east is
6:31
the silk road. So that's from China all the way over to um Turkey all that way
6:38
and there's an economic power shift that they are the ones that are in charge. That's 75% of manufacturing and that's
6:44
the largest um workforce and supply chain is there. What you are experiencing right now is that Europe is
6:51
aggressively going to war because then in a recession there's a geopolitical reset where everybody is trying to grow
6:59
but they're unable to grow. So the only way out if you cannot grow is actually a
7:04
war and we have globalization reset. So if you haven't noticed um one and a half
7:10
years ago or two years ago um MBS the prince of Saudi Arabia he went off the
7:17
petro dollar and the petro dollar was the only element where the rest of the
7:22
world paid the US debt down that's the marriage between US dollar gold and oil
7:28
so everything should be bought on US currency hence everybody was paying the down US depth MBS decided you can buy
7:36
oil in whatever whatever currency you want. That means when the new president
7:42
of the USA came in, the Federal Reserve only comes in to a president to an
7:49
incoming president if they do um accord. And an accord has only been written two
7:56
times before. So that's the third accord. The accord is when there's a monitoring reset system. They are
8:02
describing an age pages. Look it up at the web on on the internet. is called Malago accord. They are describing in
8:09
certain phases what the US will do. They will decrease the value of the US dollar. They will increase to get
8:17
manufacturing back and they will implement tariffs. If these three things are not working, they will go to war. So
8:25
the reasons why US is doing that they had over 70 to 90 years mingled in the
8:31
world economic powers and they're losing that power. So there's an globalization
8:38
reset that is happening a multipleization there will be wars for the next 10
8:43
years. So these wars are a reset system in a monitoring system. The reasons why
8:50
I'm starting off where we are right now is because then we go back seeing where did we come from and where are we moving
8:56
because this is this creates clarity for you to see which situation are we in
9:02
now. How come the richer become richer? The poorer can barely come by. How come
9:08
all organizations are structured by shareholder values and are raising capitals in the fund but the last three
9:15
years there's no merchant acquisition. there's no IPO. So these are the alarm
9:21
clocks that are shouting out what is coming. What you see that one part of the world is growing and expanding and
9:29
the other part of the world is colliding together. So this is what's called the economic revolution. It's a power shift
9:36
towards the east. So the east is also part of Africa because the silk road
9:41
goes down to Africa. South Africa goes to Africa, Middle East and and Central
9:47
Europe. This is the situation that we are in right now. So the economic pillar is the backbone of any economy.
9:55
But any economy is always based on manufacturing or supply chain. And the
10:01
backbone of that is normally energy and trade and how the economy works. So what
10:07
you're looking at right now is the fourth industrial revolution, the first industrial revolution, the second industrial revolution and the third
10:14
industrial revolution. And the backbone of each revolution has actually been engineering.
10:22
engineering um in the first one um decided on how we can use steam powers,
10:28
how we can do the assembly line, how we can structure work and they they they
10:33
used material to engineer their way out. In every industrial revolution,
10:39
engineers have been the guys that have been inventing stuff, making stuff and reorganizing stuff. They've been
10:45
changing the way we work, changing the way materials are using, changing the
10:51
way we transport, changing the way we're doing financing. Engineering has been the backbone of everything in society.
10:59
So as the field is a very structured scientific field, it becomes a bigger
11:06
and bigger responsibility for engineers to innovate certain aspects to it. And
11:11
that's what I want to go through with you. So as you see the energy source that is coming here right we're also on
11:17
a crossroad because the renewable energies are we using since 2022
11:25
we're increasing every year our input output of fossil oil to produce
11:31
renewable energies. Renewable energies are not that renewable. They're not
11:36
lasting very long. The life cycle is no longer than 5 to 10 years. if that's an electric cars or if that's a solar panel
11:44
or whatever. So they're not really giving the effect back that we're desiring even though we're focusing on
11:50
it. So that's one of the field where we need to focus on to focus to get a
11:55
better cleaner source of energy, more sustainable water and a better way we we
12:01
we can drive most of these elements. So the reasons why I'm showing you this piece, the fourth indust revolution, it
12:08
looks for your picture a little bit more like this. There are 77 mega trends that
12:15
are colliding in the fourth fourth industrial revolution. The fourth industrial revolutions is the collisions
12:21
of the digital world, the physical world and the virtual world. So when I did the strategy for Germany in 2008, we did the
12:29
strategy because we were in in recession in Europe and the mother of Europe is
12:34
Germany and normally in strategy you go in and look at productivity. You need to restart productivity for three four
12:42
quarters before you can grow. That's called organic growth and then you do competitive growth and some other parts
12:48
of growth. And what we realized there at this time
12:54
trends mega trends is one thing that was there only for 5 to 10 years and you can
13:00
easily react on it. In 2008,
13:06
mobile phones, big data, internet and um
13:11
and and cloud were and and consumerism were all colliding and so on. Your phone
13:17
when you look here was not the same in 2008 than it is today. Internet was
13:22
divided. So today it's virtually, physically and digitally. So everything
13:28
is connected into one. And this world has increased since then. These 77 mega
13:34
trends are divided into science and technology trends, regulatory trends,
13:39
workforce trends, environmental trends, globalization trends, demographic trends, economic trends and consumer
13:46
trends. And there are normal archetypes and archetypes is has normally an
13:51
inclination towards something. So when you look at AI, AI has an archetype that
13:57
it can do transformation for productivity and growth or innovation. So it depends on what you
14:04
use it for everything it has a certain inclination to something. So the important element I want to demonstrate
14:10
to you here is that since everybody is obsessed with technology the driver of
14:18
the next decade would not necessarily come from technology.
14:24
We think it will come from technology but it's the combination and collic
14:29
collision of all these other trends that are making the shift towards that. That's why the economic power shift is
14:36
towards the east. So that's a quite an important element to it and I want to go through some of these skills that are
14:42
relevant for that. So when you see the fourth industrial revolution, the fourth industrial revolution emerges
14:48
in eight evolutionary stages. The first one is digitalization. It's
14:54
IoT. Today it's called AI OT. So most AI projects are by design today 90%
15:01
digitalization. Digitalization is quite easy. You do it by digital sensory connectivity.
15:08
Then you do it by digital engineering. So you connect devices with machines
15:13
with systems with people. And then you go to the next level where you go digital operations. These faces are the
15:20
faces that you go and within each phase you use AI. So AI I will demystify that
15:26
a little bit later but that's where we're getting at now. Right? So then we have technology revolution technology
15:33
revolutions with robots 3D printing and all of this. And in 2008, people thought
15:39
when I was talking about AI that I was smoking and they told me, Henry,
15:46
in 2016, they were all afraid that their jobs would be taken. And in 2018,
15:53
we got the noral um networks, the neural connections. But AI has been there for
15:58
quite a while. AI is categorization categor classification of data. How you
16:05
use algorithms to do machine learning. How you are um using rags and other
16:12
parts to segment data to get more out of it. Then we have virtualization of data. We have um augmentations of data. We
16:20
have all these pieces that we use. Today we call it all AI but it's business
16:25
intelligence. All of this is all part of it. Today it's under this big umbrella of AI but AI is something very specific.
16:32
It's the automation of intelligence at it emerges in eight different um waves. I'm going through that with you in a
16:39
second. Then we have the environment revolution. The environment revolution is a regulatory force. So suddenly you
16:47
realize oops one of it is technology the other one is technology. Then you have one which is mainly a regulatory
16:54
revolution. And the environmental revolution is the Paris agreement, Coyoto agreement where all countries
16:59
agreed on scope one, scope two and scope three. And scope one and scope two and
17:06
scope three. I was part of forming that in the European Union is actually how do companies pollute less
17:13
in terms of scope one direct income. So water and energy consumption they have
17:20
and how much they pollute with the water that come out and energy. Scope two is how are they sourcing products, which
17:27
type of energy are they using, how are they packaging, how are they distributing, how they're shipping out
17:34
and all of this in one cycle. So they can have a circular in decrease on their
17:40
pollution. Scope one and scope two are both reporting
17:45
and scope three is the inherit send between one supplier to another supplier
17:51
to another supplier to another supplier until it comes out. So scope one and scope two is a reporting element. It's a
17:59
little bit like I'm writing you as a as a participant a sin letter like the
18:05
Catholic Church in the 200 years ago and the I declare you a sinner and you can
18:11
only buy your way out by reporting. So you need to demonstrate via report that
18:17
you're good but that report needs to be validated because you cannot say that you are net zero. You have to validate
18:23
you every year improve. So that's called deduction where they get tax deduction
18:28
in every country. Scope three works a little bit different. Scope three is where I gather one product to another
18:35
product to another product together to assemble it to transport it to ship it until the products in Germany.
18:43
Whoever receives the product in Germany every time it crosses the border you have to pay for example Cban
18:50
um where you have to based on the product either you have subsidized the product in the country
18:56
or you are paying the tax when you go over so scope one scope two and scope
19:01
three is a taxation element but most companies can profit around 5% in eida
19:07
when they're proactively in it so it's the first time regulations as a
19:12
regulatory revolution is there to decrease the pollution that manufacturers and suppliers are doing
19:19
and actually getting a benefit out of it to invest more to get less pollution out
19:25
and the last couple of years has shown that companies are doing it and it's actually working but it's all starting
19:31
next year actively where they deduction from it so most of them will panic so
19:36
whatever you design in products or whatever you design you have to have that in mind both on scope one and scope
19:43
two and scope three because they are the regulations and somehow in this world we
19:48
have decided on some funny thing everything has a life cycle except
19:54
regulations regulations never die so this is something you have to have in back
20:00
mountain and then we have the economic revolution we just went through wave one and wave two and wave three and we are
20:06
currently in wave two that means we will be in 10 year period of war. And war is
20:13
not necessarily bad. War is where we're resetting the pillars on trade,
20:18
resetting the pillars on manufacturing, resetting the pillars on innovation, doing something better and even more
20:26
effective. That's where engineering really comes in. So then we have the bio
20:32
revolution that is coming. I'm going through this in a second. the consumer revolution going through this fusion um
20:38
science revolution and the quantum revolution. I will go through each of them in details because then you realize
20:44
holy macaroni the future is actually based on engineering
20:50
and what is changing in engineering that engineering has the ability to focus on this and one of it is that the
20:57
discipline is changing one of it discipline moves out of its core discipline to add more to it and the
21:04
other part is that we're going back to fundamental research because part of that fundamental research we hadn't done
21:10
really well. So that is in summary the fourth industrial revolution how it's moving
21:17
and I'm now moving into each of these pillars and now a short word on AI right
21:22
so the reality check on AI is a little bit more like this we have symbolic AI and we have narrow
21:29
AI symbolic n and narrow AI they already work just nobody talks about it that's
21:35
machine learning and that's robotic process optimization so 10 years ago
21:42
Mckenzie and Deoid, they went out to the world preaching robotic process optimization like this was God's gift to
21:49
mankind. The funny thing is nobody talks about it today
21:55
because today they are selling large language models. So what most companies
22:01
need is robotic process optimization. It's just cheap. you can buy for 500 euros your robotic process optimization
22:08
for forecast planning budgeting for HR recruitment for all these simple elements 95% of AI projects fail with
22:17
enterprise information so this is where you need to go back to the fundamentals
22:23
so AI by design is a colonization tool you have very big
22:30
players that are infringing on intellectual capital stealing your information and
22:36
reselling your information. So, um, large language models
22:43
work for consumers really well. They're very very limited in how they work with
22:49
corporate information and very very limit on specialization tools. So when
22:54
you look at the big providers for health care, IBM's solution and all these other ones, they work for journals, they work
23:02
for all medicine's information, all of this, but they're quite limited to how
23:07
they work and structure their data. So you need to be specialized in building
23:13
your own rats, your own machine learning agents that are localized where you own
23:19
your own information and you use your own mathematical models to work on this.
23:25
So a golden rule I can give you here, don't use the large language models
23:31
where the open source is closed. use one where you have for example Grock you can
23:39
download the mathematic matable formulas you can reuse them on your own servers so you have an ability to learn and
23:46
relearn and that's one of the most important elements the way you can structure your data in this
23:53
then you have the other parts you have generative type AI and artificial
23:58
generative intelligence these two things are do not exist it's marketing that they are racing
24:05
capital for this to work. We are fooled because they look like us but they are not us. So there are eight disciplines
24:12
in AI and one of the disciplines is language. So it's a replications on what
24:19
we are doing. So when I'm talking I'm nothing else than a large language models. I'm forming my words as I'm
24:26
speaking. My thoughts and my words are not necessarily connected. So this is quite
24:34
important to understand. So it reflects something that we are but we need to learn to author our own information and
24:41
structure our own information. And then the big AI revolution actually happens in the bio revolution because
24:48
most of what we are are organisms are by design algorithms and algorithms is what
24:55
we are based on. So this will be the big revolution that is the one that is coming and I will go through this but I
25:01
want to highlight to you one thing here that you as engineers need to focus on
25:08
very very much. The idea of prototyping is core to engineering studies.
25:15
Prototyping is that you're going through a one element and you are intentionally
25:20
looking for the mistakes to learn something out of it. So large language models is an easy way
25:29
to get information but it avoids for you the mistakes. So you're not seeing or
25:35
learning the same way. So you can easily write uh Porter's uh value chain and you can
25:42
it will give you description but next week you cannot repeat the same element. If you're not written down Porter's
25:48
value chain you're trying to do it and you failed with it a couple of times. The learning of this does not work. So
25:54
the way we learn and the way we innovate as humans is actually by doing mistakes
26:01
and engineering has that discipline at the core that we're doing prototyping to explore
26:08
where we go wrong to go back to do it differently and that's an important thing that we need to re-emphasize. So
26:14
when you look at from an engineering perspective, engineering consists of three different disciplines. Enterprise
26:21
engineering which are the principles of design think um
26:27
um design thinking, design principles, planning concepts, structural concepts,
26:32
quality concepts, integration concepts and testing. So that's classification, categorization, simplification
26:39
um of working out of the complex elements or decomposing. Right? So decomposing to a simple by order right
26:46
so you take a car and you split in thousand pieces to see how you can structure and order in a different way
26:52
together right so for this piece enterprise engineering the most important element you need for this is a
26:59
model of understanding so this is a principle we need to go back to we learn
27:04
in school but we are derating from so let me show you
27:10
a model of understanding And I guess you have all seen it but I just want to show it to you because
27:17
sometimes you see something and you learn in school but you just leave it behind.
27:23
Right? So if you all can see the screen this is a simplified model of understanding right.
27:30
So this is strategic tactical
27:36
and operational. That's a normal organization. So within that you have strategic, you have strategy, planning,
27:43
forecasting, budgeting and value. And you see how they're going forth and back. This is a very simplified way you
27:50
do it. This is a more complex model of understanding of an enterprise. What
27:58
pieces work with what? It's the same model just in with semantics and
28:03
ontology. So you're relating the things together. what sends out, what receives,
28:08
what can be modeled, and what can be changed. So,
28:14
I'm going back again to the presentation. Have you all seen a model of understanding before? Just thumbs up if
28:20
you've seen one.
28:30
Just thumbs up if you've seen a model of understanding before. Okay, that's good. And so the reasons
28:38
why this model of understanding is really really important because in the
28:44
model of understanding you can decompose something, how it relates together to to
28:50
decompose it and to assemble again because part of this is how we look at things, how it relates, what affects it
28:57
and what do we need to change. This is where the transformation and the innovation comes in. And then we have
29:03
the other pieces that we have which is enterprise modeling and enterprise
29:08
modeling. Enterprise modeling has come in from the element where we are designing business
29:15
models to rules information modeling. So data and infrastructure enterprise
29:22
architecture. We do measurements. We do process notations. Process notations are
29:27
decision cycles in information flow, data flow, performance flow. Right? We do performance modeling, service
29:34
modeling and value modeling. So enterprise architecture from the discipline of a core enterprise
29:41
architecture has moved into the core of an how an organization works and how it
29:46
operates within that organization. So that's also capability modeling within services. So you structure the people
29:53
you structure how they form, how they design, how the organiz is designed, how
29:59
financing works. So beyond organizing an engineering tool, you actually go into
30:05
the IT elements to it. So if you want to build a drone, if you want to build a robot, this is where these two pieces
30:11
come together. And then you have the enterprise architecture which is the element of architecting the
30:19
backbone for the serviceoriented solution information flow process flow technology and solution flow. Each of
30:25
them are the relationship connectivity design and physical expectations of
30:30
something. So from conceptual to physical. So this is where IoT comes in.
30:35
This is where AI relates to the other three. This is where these three worlds
30:40
collide together. And there's no other discipline where this is happening. That means in biioinformatics,
30:47
nanotechnology, all of these disciplines, they all collide together in these three worlds together. So even
30:53
though if you learned in school some pieces of it, today your discipline includes all of these three disciplines.
31:00
So you have to relate to them in terms of how you do your ontology,
31:06
semantics, object description of the nature. So what is the nature of this? Is this
31:12
non-core? Is it core differentiating? Right? How can I model it? What's the description of it? What is the
31:18
relationship to and what rules does it have? Right? So let me ask you, this is
31:23
where I'm just going to ask a question to everybody. Right? Do you all know what semantics and
31:28
anttology is?
31:40
Have you worked with it before? So the ontology is the meaning of a
31:47
word. And so for example, when you look at me,
31:53
I'm a dad, I have a wife, I have children, I um
32:01
Right. So uh I'm a grandfather. So for my children, I'm a coach. I'm a taxi
32:08
driver. I'm a supporter. I'm a financeier. I'm a project manager.
32:15
Right? And to my wife, I'm a I'm a lover. I'm um husband. I'm a um peer.
32:25
I'm so many things. But I'm to my sons, I'm not a lover. Right? So the word is
32:31
that I'm a father. I'm a grandfather and I'm a husband and I'm a lover. is the
32:36
hat I carry of what it is to be me. But being me is the relationship to who I'm
32:44
have a semantic. So the semantic is the relationship I have to my wife, the relationship I have to my um um sons or
32:52
to my grandchildren. So this is how you create a model of understanding and the model of understanding is how you
32:58
decompose it. So you're defining the archetype of something what is core and you cannot split it anymore. And then
33:05
you see how's this archetype relating to the other pieces and then you're
33:11
creating step by step. So a piece of advice I'm doing here for myself
33:16
normally every morning I have in my at home I have two whiteboards and I write
33:21
every month I have two questions of unsolved problems
33:28
and these unsolved problems I'm creating thereby a classification
33:34
and a categorization and the classification is a simple by order and I looking at the archetypes
33:41
and Then I look at how they relate to each other and then I decompose it and then I assemble again. And it's not that
33:48
I'm going to the internet a large language models to find a solution. I'm training my brain to see what I cannot
33:55
see. So semantics and ontologies is a core tool within engineering.
34:01
categorization, classification, decomposing are the tools box you have as engineers to see things, make a model
34:09
of understanding how you can change it, how you can alter it and you do scenario thinking, prototyping until you get out
34:15
to it. So this is the core tool you will use for anything in your discipline. So
34:21
I'm sharing the slides again. Um
34:28
I guess I was already sharing them.
34:34
Good. So why is this important? Because the discipline of an engineer
34:41
relates to any organizations in terms of the trends are coming. You can see them
34:46
in a visual element in your value chain where you do a strategic positioning. You can do a business model where you do
34:55
strategic tactical operational in terms of running the business or developing the business. This is normally what
35:00
you're involved in. Then you have your service model, your capability modeling with people, right? And you have your
35:06
operating model, your information model, data model, technology model, inf infrastructure model. Suddenly you
35:13
realize, holy smokes, Henrik, you just went through all of these principles we have. So some of the principles are in
35:19
systems, some of them are digital, some of them are virtual, right? And some of them are physical. And they are the four
35:25
worlds that you are going from one rainbow color to the other color. You're
35:30
the only one in your discipline that does that. So you have to be really good
35:36
at moving from one piece to the other piece. You have to have this hunger for knowledge to constantly learn new things
35:42
and new elements because you are the guys that need to manage strategy, the
35:48
physical world to develop stuff and systems. So this goes forth and back. So
35:53
let's move to the bio revolution. The bio revolution is the biggest AI
35:58
revolution that is coming and as I was mentioning the first out of the eight
36:04
discipline in AI is language models. The second one is AI molecular data and AI
36:11
molecular data. There is 100 times more data out there in the world than
36:16
language models. will be finished in two years in that the large language monster has consumed all information then it's
36:24
just producing crap comes out with more mistakes. So AI molecular data is our
36:31
cellular data. So the secret with our cellular data it's the binding of it the
36:37
information that it has and it's based on algorithms how it's binding. So as
36:42
our cells can carry data if you didn't know it our cells are 99% empty space
36:49
the rest of it is the cellular wall and the cellular information that is in there. So your cell can already carry
36:57
information. So what you will see the next couple of years is bios so living software is
37:04
moving in that direction. Biocomputing so bio machines and cyber physical
37:11
systems. These three elements is how your nervous system will work, how your DNA strings are working and how your
37:18
body, your chemical body is interacting with the algorithms that you're programming within these three layers.
37:24
Then you have the promise of cure is how promise of cure is going to to that it
37:31
will be customized element in terms of your body how you have evolved and uh
37:36
how your body can work on and that agriculture the future of food biotech agriculture how we have come the last 80
37:44
years in terms of we can harvest even more it will even change far more the
37:49
one thing we have care be careful about is that we're not using losing biod diversity
37:56
than smart material. Do you know why plastic is so difficult
38:01
for us? Plastic is so difficult for us because it's a molecular binding that is so
38:08
strong. It lets no air in. So it cannot decompose.
38:14
So will we develop material where we can decompose it? Yes.
38:21
Think about it. The future of food and the future of material relates to each other. The orange you eat today was not
38:28
the orange 200 years ago. The strawberry you eat today is also not the strawberry
38:34
you ate at that time. These strawberries has been polonized, polonized,
38:40
polonized, polonized. The orange was a gift to the Dutch king, right? That's
38:45
why they love the orange colors in Holland. So this is part of the biggest
38:51
change that you will see there where all data and information comes from outside
38:58
to your body. Think about the speed of how you put your data into your
39:03
information is in terms of how fast you can transform your data from here to here and that will change that will
39:10
change quite radically. Then we have the bio interface. It's where our reality
39:15
changes. So the bio revolution will be the biggest AI revolution. So what you see
39:22
today in AI is AI language models. The biggest AI revolution will happen in AI
39:28
molecular data. And molecular data will be open for everybody and shared for
39:35
everybody.
39:42
The after the bio revolution we have the consumer revolution and the consumer revolution emerges after the bio
39:49
revolution because today when you are on the internet you are the product when
39:55
you gather your data and web 3.0 was
40:01
always designed to come before blockchain or AI but they were so hungry
40:06
for money that they were more willing to have the money than protect the consumers. So web 3.0 is still to be
40:14
built and merged in the consumer revolution. That means you own your
40:19
information like they are doing in Europe right now. So you own your pictures, your
40:25
information, your medical data, all of this you you own. So you can monetize it
40:31
later. So the privacy, the ability to monetize what you own,
40:37
whatever information, attention you give, you also earn money on. that is shifting in the consumer revolution. It
40:43
changed the way that we consume and how companies are interacting with us. So
40:48
that's the big big shift. That's why it's the revolution after the bio revolution. And then we're coming to the
40:55
fusion revolution. That's your biggest revolution. That's unlimited energy,
41:01
abundant water from desanitation, interplanetary uh species traveling to whatever like
41:08
like these big guys wants to do. It would be an economic reset on the monitoring system. It would be a change
41:15
on the society on how society works because the consumer revolution will change society. Humans will be a
41:22
bioobotic elements where we are our bi by by biometrics life cycle will change
41:29
based on this. I'm not talking about living forever. I'm talking about optimizing our intention and willpower
41:37
and optimizing our bi biology. And then there will be a future on trans um
41:45
transportation. In all of these, they're driven by engineers, they're driven by you guys. So most of this is futuristic,
41:53
but it's not that far off, right? Nuclear fusion, salt infusion,
42:00
molten view fusion, water desanitation, it's already happening. So all of this
42:06
is not that far off, but it needs engineers like you that are imagining the future and inventing the future.
42:14
So my saying to this is always the more technology we driven we become the more
42:20
human humanity we need to become in there. So think about the following things. Humans we are the only ones who
42:27
have the ability to adapt. We are emotional beings and because we
42:33
are emotional beings our output is not always both based on machines. So in the
42:41
first two revolutions we replaced our
42:46
workforce hands with horsepower or machines. Right? In
42:52
the third and fourth revolution we're exchanging our brain power
42:57
for automation. But that doesn't replace the humans. The human is still the centerpiece of any evolution. And we
43:05
need to make sure that the human is there. Then we come to the quantum revolutions. I know most of you will not
43:11
really touch this because this is only something between China and US and then
43:16
in Switzerland and Germany maybe but it's a discipline that is is is the
43:22
science of crazy science.
43:28
If you probably listened quite carefully to your physics schools you realize both
43:34
Einstein and Nilso are right. So, um,
43:40
if you look, if this would be a pen and I'm putting I have 100 million
43:47
fibers here and I put in one of it one ticky,
43:54
where do you think the one tab comes out here? on the same one or on one of the other
44:02
ones or on any one.
44:07
The answer is quite simple. It comes wherever I'm looking at. So with this I'm changing both the past I'm changing
44:15
on where it was actually I'm moving back in time. So there's quantum is the the
44:21
science of the freaks. That means it it um
44:27
the high the lower down you go, the more quantum you have, the higher up you go,
44:33
the more physical science you have. So we need to go back to some of the fundamental physics and chemistry that
44:40
we have and rethink the different models. So some of these things are
44:46
already quite real. So when you see what is proven and what has an impact today and what is theoretically that will be
44:53
coming there right quantum communications is already real quantum
44:59
entanglement meaning that I can sit here and I have entangled two atoms he has
45:06
the same machine and I have the same machines we have split the two atoms and wherever I'm moving this it's moving in
45:13
the same direction so we can communicate without any connection between us. That's called quantum communications.
45:21
Then we have quantum computer, quantum cryptologology and quantum machine learning. These four elements are
45:28
already real. Then you have most of them are evolving or in prototyping and are
45:34
in testing. So you can ask yourself am I'm touching them and I'm interested in
45:40
them and I'm interested to move below that. Right? Because when you have quantum energy storage,
45:47
our biggest problem today with energy storage, it actually doesn't last very long. Lasts 5 years, 10 years. So yes,
45:56
then we use the material. But if we can move towards a better, more efficient and sustainable way to do that, holy
46:03
smokes, then we can really move towards electronics elements. Electronics today
46:10
is seems like a dead horse riding because the capital of return the
46:15
storage element the infrastructure all of this is not proving it has it's like
46:21
machine learning in AI it has hit like a death well and we need engineers to
46:27
bring us out of the death valley so energy storage is a big theme we need to
46:32
get you guys to focus on and work on so this was quite short about the fourth
46:40
industrial revolution. I think it gave you a picture in reality. I'm taking you very very quickly
46:48
through some you can take a picture you will get them. They are the trend radars I'm doing for the world economic forums.
46:54
That's why you see I'm doing that with the different universities. You can see which trends are affecting which
47:00
industries in which way and what are they implementing and how they implemented are depending on you. So this is from for manufacturing. This is
47:07
for supply chain. This is for energy. So there's energy generations, energy
47:13
storage and energy transportation or getting it from A to B. So you can take
47:18
a picture of it. You will get the presentation anyway. But this is the shortest version I want to get at. This is the piece I want to close off with
47:24
before I'm opening up for questions. Right? Your discipline is under a huge
47:30
change. That means you need to learn more technology in terms of which
47:35
merging technologies are merging up and how can you use your
47:41
basic discipline on engineer engineering um engineering IT or strategy and
47:48
engineering architecture you're going across all of these fields then financial engineering so how you do
47:55
inventory financing how you do setup in terms of assets how you can leverage assets You're using the same disciplines
48:02
you're using for engineering you use for financing. Financing works silos. You
48:07
are the only one that can look I'm decomposing it and I'm assembling it. You look at the profit and loss and
48:13
saying okay how do we need to model the profit and loss. This is your discipline. The same thing with
48:19
businesses. Businesses have a certain structure and you need to redesign business engineering to say good should
48:27
we change the structure we have today on inc is with shareholders should we sh change it with a shares and b
48:33
shareholders so we instead of having a stock market out then we create a stock market inside the company this is where
48:39
you guys need to come in because that's a discipline of business modeling it
48:45
where you understand the rules of engagement of the structure of the organization on how it works. That's why
48:51
you move into corporate engineering. Right? So then I'm proposing that you
48:57
guys hold the key for the future of work.
49:02
And the future of work is quite simple. The future of work is
49:07
you have program management, portfolio management, um project management and portfolio
49:14
management. Project management is over 150 years old. It's nothing else than a
49:20
gun chart within that if the portfolio management changes the project
49:26
management changes and when the PR management changes the program management changes. So if you change the organizations you're moving the head
49:33
like this. The link between portfolio management project management
49:38
and program management is often not established. This is your job to establish this link in terms of
49:45
performance SBOS's, performance measurements, roles, activities, right? If you align them together, you
49:52
strengthen the organization for performance and output. This is your job by the way, right? Then you need to
49:59
foster more humanentric cross discipline. You need to add new skills
50:04
to your disciplines and always have the human as the centerpiece of this. And my final
50:11
element that is a strategic imperative for you. We have been really really bad
50:17
and I'm going out of the presentation so you can have the last slide here. All
50:23
right. So I can see your face. We have been really really bad as research.
50:30
And I'm not blaming you guys. You probably written some research. Most research today, I'm a professor in
50:36
economics and strategy is not real research.
50:44
Most are a gathering of reports that are gathering something.
50:50
I'm so disappointed by the current generations on the research. I'm advising them to take some of the
50:57
biggest problems, do a model of understanding, try to solve the problem, but they want to go for what is what
51:04
they can get an output on and what they are making sure that they can succeed. the most valuable research. If you do a
51:11
research on a problem and the conclusion is that we tried this and this and this
51:16
was the outcome that means in four or five years later somebody in the same
51:21
discipline comes in and sees your research and say oh he had this approach and that was the outcome. Ah I think if
51:27
we change this pieces he's in a different field he can leverage it. So our research today is not based on
51:34
things that are not working. It's only based on success stories and we need good to go back to basic physics, basic
51:41
chemistry, rethink some of our basic models and allow ourself in research to
51:47
focus on mistakes. Hypothesis do the research come with the outcome
51:54
and be honest about it even if it doesn't work because that would be the biggest value for you guys later when
52:00
you try to build something and you cannot see it, you cannot work with it. That's the dis discipline that you need
52:05
to work on. So in closing for you guys,
52:11
I believe you live in one of the most exciting times.
52:16
We are under the biggest change ever. And you guys that are in the sound of my
52:22
voice, the future's on your shoulder to engineer the future, to think about it,
52:29
to challenge old principles, to decompose, to reassess. The biggest gift
52:37
that you have been given as a human is your ability to think strategically.
52:43
So use your time when you have I use my time in the
52:48
morning where I'm alone to think about things not because I want to solve something because I want to train my
52:55
brain when I'm driving my car. I drive a Porsche Panamera Turbo S. I'm not using
53:01
my GPS. Why? Because I need to train my brain indirectly. Right? So use your
53:08
most powerful tool to train them. Try to see what is not seen. The big difference
53:14
between you and AI is very simple. AI only works from the known. When you and
53:21
I work together, you come from one area, you come from another area. So as we come from two
53:28
areas, you and I have the ability to touch the unknown. And that's the unique
53:33
thing we have as human beings. So thank you very much for your time. I think the field that you live in as engineers are
53:39
one of the most exciting fields. The biggest innovation is currently happening in manufacturing and supply
53:44
chain if that's the field of your interest because that's where products are developed. That's where machines are
53:50
developed. That's where um the future resides on in manufacturing. So thank
53:57
you very much for your time and my opening up for question. Thank you so much professor Hill. It was
54:04
quite an interesting one. uh today. So you actually do have a couple of questions and ladies and gentlemen I did
54:11
ask for questions from the beginning. So it is going to work on a first confessor basis. If your questions come too late
54:19
then it means we will not be moving forward with your questions. So the first question that I have professor is
54:26
from Charles and he asks what frameworks should be established for regulating AIdriven biotechnological
54:33
uh innovations and whilst you're answering that I will upload the information for the certificates of
54:38
attendance. So I'm actually leading with Dr. Abia
54:44
Hadak the world economic formed regulatory intelligence committee where
54:49
we have gathered all the countries together to create best practices on how we can regulate that I'm establishing
54:56
for the world economic forum tons of committees I'm only participating in three in the regulatory ones in a
55:04
manufacturing one and in the supply chain one because I want to make a real big difference there so um the
55:10
regulatoratory aspects on AI is different Right. So the US has barely none,
55:17
Europe is overregulated and and China is um doing their own
55:24
stuff. Australia has gone baloney. They have just overloaded everything. So
55:29
Europe is taking the following approach. We have AI regulations one which protects the consumer and their
55:35
information. I've been working on this. I'm also working on the second one which is this AI act two which is focused on
55:41
number one um children below 16 should not have access to social media that's already implemented in in the Nordic
55:48
countries that will come to the other ones too number two um people under 21
55:53
should not have access to large language models because it in interferes with human development and number two um all
56:00
chips that are running 24/7 uh needs to have a tax model to them so they can be able to compensate the
56:08
governments to um reskill people. So we have a tight element on regulations. I'm
56:14
talking quite a lot to governments to help them and support them. Um for governments regulations is difficult.
56:21
It's very very difficult um because first they're not technology guys.
56:26
Secondly, once they write it in law, you need the approval of God, Muhammad, and Allah and Buddha all at the same table
56:34
to approve that it's not relevant anymore. So once they write it in the pen, it cannot be unwritten. So they're
56:40
very careful to do anything. So this is something um that is quite important
56:46
question. So Tom asked a very long question. However, I've just gone on to summarize
56:52
it. Basically, what it's asking is, is it still worth it to learn or master a software skill that isn't based on AI or
57:00
will AI become so advanced that the only jobs that will matter will be a real
57:06
world handon work experience like uh field engineering? Would it still be of
57:12
interest for someone to learn a software or should they get field um should they get skills rather uh in fields that are
57:19
of hands-on working? So what you hear about AI isn't hype.
57:25
It's the big guy selling you something. If you do AI yourself, you do robotic
57:30
process optimization on an existing system. If you build your own farm, right, you have classification,
57:37
categorization of data, you have mathematical models, you do um machine learning, you deep machine learnings
57:44
which are mathematical models that are linked together. I can show you the whole list. You can download them for
57:49
free. You categorize data, you censor data, you supervise data, you you do
57:56
unsupervised learning. So the machine produces outcomes and you optimize the outcome of the machine. The difference
58:02
is really are you giving this to large language models or you keeping that data yourself. That means it's the same thing
58:08
as a model of understanding. You're creating the data flow model of understanding to understand the output
58:13
and input. The big problems with large language models, they don't know how it
58:19
does it. And that's the first alarm clock for you engineers. If you don't
58:25
understand something that comes with an output, you step back and says, "Oops, I need to understand how the input and
58:32
output works." Why? Because if you don't understand it, you cannot model it. It's actually really important. Um, so it's
58:39
the same thing if you look at the car and says, "Whoa, why is the car moving forward?" You decompose the machine. You
58:44
look at the wheels. You look at all of this. So you know which wheel can I optimize? Can I run on smaller wheels?
58:50
Which material do I need for the wheels? Okay. Can I run besides can I run it on
58:55
water or just can only run on gasoline? Right? This is what you do as engineers. And that's important that you do that in
59:02
AI too. So whatever they tell you, don't drink the Kool-Aid. You have to learn it
59:08
to understand it yourself. So AI is part of the IT part of engineering. You need
59:14
to understand technology, architecture, information flow, data flow. You need to
59:20
understand this because you are the ones who model this for the business and you model this for engineering. So you have
59:25
these three disciplines. So just saying well large language model will work. I'm not going to work it anymore. I'm going to raise my fingers. Oops. You're the
59:33
only ones that can do the right thing for us. If you understand it, you can put brakes in it. You can put securities
59:39
bottles in it. You can structure it and so on. I would not trust the guys that
59:45
are earning money on it. So I do believe John's question is the
59:51
same as uh the previous question. He's just asking is it worth it to master the field or just look at reskilling in
59:58
another field to which I believe you just answered. Um Elijah asked, "How can
1:00:04
I incorporate let me ask a different Is it worthwhile for you if you do
1:00:10
robotics and you do drones? Robotics and drones you can buy cheap.
1:00:18
If you need to do software for robotic and drones, you customize the software. If you use
1:00:24
robotics to drive to drive over a field and you need to sensor and connect it in a certain way, you cannot download that
1:00:32
program. You need to develop that AI program yourself. You need to write the
1:00:37
code yourself. You cannot ask large language mod just to write it because it's a very customized model. If you
1:00:43
have a drone going over the mine to scan the mine and you look for gold or you
1:00:49
look for what you are the guys that needs to think okay what is the composition of gold and copper and water
1:00:56
or diamonds right you are the guys that are going into that field and you need to customize it so is it worthwhile
1:01:03
going there yes because AI needs to be highly specialized in a field and who's
1:01:08
highly specialized you guys. So there's two questions similar again
1:01:16
however one is for civil engineering and then the other is for chemical engineering disciplines. So the same
1:01:22
question is how does one incorporate AI in either civil engineering disciplines
1:01:28
uh and the other in chemical engineering. This is to answer both Elijah as well as Michael.
1:01:34
So in if you go in chemical so chemical engineering I would go in nanotechnology
1:01:40
biioinformatics right they're highly chemical elements and then I would focus
1:01:46
on within that element you have a very different version of AI because AI works
1:01:52
on language and pro probabilities of languages but a monocular data is not
1:01:59
the same way so it's it's it's a DNA string you take and you squeeze it
1:02:05
around like this and you squeeze it and you put in a thousand pieces and then you drill it out and you see which piece
1:02:11
relates to what in which manner what can I model so you're not you're doing drug discovery modeling so AI modeling not AI
1:02:19
machine learning so you use still software and programming but you use it
1:02:24
towards something very different what is the binding elements you can do with this and that and this so don't think
1:02:31
because large language models are there that everything in AI guys done. I rely on you guys to saying okay this is the
1:02:38
noise from here I need to go down there right
1:02:44
so uh another question um I've actually closed the questions uh professor so
1:02:49
these are the questions that you have to answer and then after that we will close the session so Leslie asked what
1:02:55
disciplines can boost or can one is a mechanical engineering um professional
1:03:02
or with a mechanical engineering uh background can they adapt into these
1:03:07
mega trends? So he wants to know as someone who's in mechanical engineering how can they boost these skills and
1:03:13
adapt them to the mega trends of uh today's topic.
1:03:18
So trends are forces and drivers that come from outside. I think the biggest adoption you can do as yourself is that
1:03:25
you develop the hardcore skills of an engineer. The decomposing, conceptual thinking,
1:03:33
physical thinking, relationship thinking, classification, categorization, data, all of this,
1:03:39
right? But that you develop yourself. You de you develop yourself your
1:03:44
personal self to see at something. And I would expect everybody of you
1:03:50
who's on the call that you when you look at an apple that you look at the apple with awe and say, "Wow, how beautiful."
1:03:58
You cut the apple and you see the outer shell, you see the apple, you see the seeds in it and all of this. And even
1:04:05
though you can describe the apple and all of this, it's still an awe that should take you as an engineers away and
1:04:12
see, okay, how can I create a model of understanding of this? How can I learn more of this? How can I see more of
1:04:18
this? So, what I'm asking you to do is to train yourself to be hungry. Train
1:04:24
yourself to view the things differently. Train yourself to be that each of you
1:04:30
are one of the guys that will challenge
1:04:35
old models to find something new. The world is going through a radical change
1:04:40
and we need people like you that are willing to find solutions that it will
1:04:45
become a smarter, a wealthier and a healthier earth. And
1:04:52
that's the foundation for me in closing to decide on how do you make sure that
1:04:57
this world becomes a better future for all. It's only because everybody if they can get smarter, wealthier and
1:05:04
healthier. Not few but all. So this should be your principle as engineers.
1:05:10
How can you design this? I put my faith in you guys and with a little blessings
1:05:16
I can give you. I hope that you um have can have the ability to see what is not
1:05:22
seen. I hope you one of you guys will find solutions for things that nobody's
1:05:27
looking for. Uh, professor, do you still have time to take about four more questions?
1:05:34
Sure. Okay. So, Isabelle asks, "Are there any resources that you could share to help
1:05:41
to help people rather uh in deeper realistic and more insightful research?
1:05:46
As you mentioned, you're quite disappointed uh with the material from research these days. So, she's asking
1:05:52
for resources for such. Oh, very very good.
1:05:57
So the research is today it's so disappointing. It's so um diversity
1:06:03
identity driven that I mean like we the we have got so little output on research
1:06:10
and we have so little fundamental research. Some of the fundamental elements in physics and chemistry we
1:06:17
have not even solved. So I would suggest if you find one of these problem I have
1:06:22
20 of these problems I have on my list go through them and says oh we still don't have an answer to that why don't
1:06:29
we have an answer to that and think about it and challenge it right so um if
1:06:35
if I want to add something to you right we are in a generation
1:06:41
um where we're looking for about ourself right but here's the funny part our own
1:06:49
evolution ution depends on other people. When I got married, it changed me. When
1:06:56
I got children, it changed me. So, what I'm recommending for you in your
1:07:02
personal evolution to see more to be better at things is not only train
1:07:07
yourself, but also commit yourself to marriage. Commit yourself to be
1:07:13
responsible for something. It changes the way that you look at things. I have grandchildren now and I see how they see
1:07:21
the world. They look at it differently. I see my
1:07:26
children. I see my wife and through that I see more. So if you want to see more
1:07:33
in your life, if you want to be gifted to develop more, it's actually probably
1:07:38
by committing to something. Um so we do have another question. I do
1:07:46
believe in Song is asking or before inissor asks where do you rate
1:07:52
environmental engineering on future innovation as well as growth.
1:07:58
So where do what where do you rate environmental engineering on future innovation or
1:08:05
growth? Zero.
1:08:12
We are just mind masturbating.
1:08:18
We can do far better in putting down the pollution. We can do far better than this. I work with the biggest
1:08:23
organizations and regulation is only set up that they're only blessed. They only
1:08:29
rewarded. They could do such a leap frog but they only do that much because they
1:08:34
have to do every year a 10% improvement. So companies are not
1:08:40
doing I do 10% improvement on polluting less. No, no, they're waiting. Okay, I can take the slap this year, next year
1:08:47
and then I do a big push but not too much because then I have these three, right? So we can do more.
1:08:55
We can do far far more on in in terms of this, right? So our challenge with
1:09:02
environmental innovation is that the people that are responsible for sustainability today in organizations
1:09:08
they are people that came from marketing that moved over to sustainability and
1:09:15
sustainability is moving the financial officer needs to move in together with
1:09:20
the marketing because before it's about how great they are now it needs to be about the numbers because companies are
1:09:26
only moving to hardcore sustainab ability to decrease the pollution when
1:09:32
it matters in the pocket. Okay. And Cis asks for instrumentation
1:09:41
uh for an instrumentation and automation engineer or engineers rather uh how do
1:09:46
how does it relate to the future technology? Um I'm reading it as it is.
1:09:52
I'm not sure what he meant but from my understanding he's asking how does instrumentation and automation tie into
1:09:59
the future technology especially in an era where there is AI models
1:10:06
so AI is normally used for automating so if you look at a warehouse and you look at an assembly line or warehouse
1:10:12
management and so on right you're using it in anything which is noncore so when you look at any object normally right
1:10:19
you normally look and saying okay I should optimize and integrate
1:10:25
the 60 to 80% should be automated because it's noncore everything which is
1:10:32
in nature this is the principle you do in engineering first what is the nature of this is this noncore then you
1:10:38
automatically know if it's non-core I can automate it integrate it and align it you can use AI principle into it then
1:10:45
you say everything which is unique in nature or complex in nature so when is
1:10:51
complex in nature like warehouse management you realize oops if I use the
1:10:57
same the principles to non-core I automate it then I'm doing something wrong I'm siloing what it's doing and
1:11:04
because it's complex in nature it needs to move all the time because it's performancedriven so warehouse
1:11:10
management you do digitalization you don't do automation so digitalization is different than AI
1:11:17
automation right so it's the nature Natures what you do with it. When it's
1:11:24
unique or strategic in nature, you either have risk assessment to it,
1:11:29
governance to it or forecast to it. Right? So the nature of what it is
1:11:35
decides on how you use. So these are I'm telling you engineering principles. So
1:11:41
engineering principles is also life cycles. life cycle of information, life cycle of
1:11:48
processes, of activities and outcomes. And the life cycles decide in which life
1:11:53
cycle you are which principles you will use.
1:11:58
So I'm just teaching you the same principles that are in engineering. So you're just moving away from the
1:12:04
theory to the practice. So here is our last question for today's
1:12:11
webinar. Uh Charlie asks if you can please provide info or resources for
1:12:16
understanding and implementing AI modeling and creating the customized uh
1:12:22
artificial intelligence models. I'm guessing that you are talking about
1:12:28
so if you have robotic process optimization search on the internet robotic process
1:12:35
optimiz I think I have the slide here somewhere for you guys.
1:12:44
Let me see if I
1:12:56
good. I'm just sharing the slides with you very fast. So you can see you you
1:13:02
will not get this one. So take the screenshot of it. Right. So this is the hype cycle of AI. Right? So if you look
1:13:10
here, these models are nothing else than mathematical models that you use.
1:13:18
So you can download them free from the internet. Machine learning, all these models are
1:13:25
free. Vector databases, all these models are free. If you come up here, you need an
1:13:33
experts to it. But this none of this is is something where you say well Henrik
1:13:39
well this is rocket science. No it's not rocket science. If you're in data and you do machine learning you are hardcore
1:13:47
going into mathematics. You're doing mathematical formulas supervised learning and non-supervised
1:13:54
learning. You're programming it in this way and this way. You can download models free from Groc. Brock is the only
1:14:01
large language models that shares all its sources for free. You can download
1:14:06
the mathematical models. You should be so excited about it. You should anybody
1:14:12
you should not use open source anymore. You should only use crop. Why? Because
1:14:17
you should support as an engineer somebody that shares opensource information that you can take these
1:14:23
mathematical models and build your own one in Africa to say, "Oh, I like these ones will work. I think I'm using this
1:14:30
for my drone solution for the props because today you don't get it anywhere else, right? And I must say uh Elon Musk
1:14:39
is probably a figure that is on both sides, good and bad, but in this side he
1:14:44
does the right thing, right? Our field is closed on AI mathematical formula and
1:14:51
he's the only one who opens it up for everybody. So you should praise him from
1:14:57
your own form so you can use it. That is it. We are done ladies and
1:15:03
gentlemen. Thank you so much Professor Henrik. It was quite entertaining as much as it was informative. Uh ladies
1:15:10
and gentlemen, you will receive uh a copy of this recording as well as the
1:15:15
information that the professor has provided us with. Thank you so much, Professor Hendrik. It was a pleasure.
1:15:21
Enjoy the rest of your
