## long_now

*Path: 0/lecture/long_now*

The Long Now Foundation is a non-profit organization established in 1996 to foster long-term thinking and counteract humanity's increasingly short-term mindset. The foundation's work addresses "civilization-scale challenges" by encouraging people to think within a 10,000-year framework, which they call "the long now". 

Origin and founding principles
The Long Now Foundation was founded by a group of forward-thinking individuals from diverse backgrounds:
- Stewart Brand: An author, environmentalist, and founder of the Whole Earth Catalog. He observed that civilization was developing a "pathologically short attention span".
- Danny Hillis: A computer scientist and inventor who proposed the initial idea for a 10,000-year clock to stimulate long-term thinking.
- Brian Eno: A musician and artist who coined the term "the long now" after observing the modern culture's accelerated sense of time. 
The founders' goal was to build a cultural institution that would not only talk about the long term but also undertake practical projects that embody and require a long-term perspective. 

Core projects
The foundation brings its mission to life through large-scale, symbolic, and practical projects:
- The Clock of the Long Now: A monument-scale mechanical clock, designed by Danny Hillis, that is intended to keep time for 10,000 years. The project is under construction inside a mountain in West Texas. The hope is that the clock will become a lasting mythic monument that inspires a multi-generational perspective.
- The Rosetta Project: An initiative to create a comprehensive, publicly accessible digital library of human languages to combat linguistic extinction. The project has also produced a durable nickel alloy disc containing thousands of languages, with one version having been sent into space on the European Space Agency's Rosetta Mission.
- Seminars About Long-Term Thinking (SALT): A monthly lecture series in San Francisco that features influential thinkers discussing topics relevant to the long-term future. The seminars are released as popular podcasts, spreading the ideas of long-term thinking to a global audience.
- The Manual for Civilization: A library of 3,500 books intended to provide a condensed, curated record of human knowledge and technology for the current generation and their descendants. The collection is housed at The Interval, the foundation's public space.
- PanLex: A linguistic project that seeks to build an open-source, panlingual lexical database to overcome language barriers to human information and rights.
- The Interval: A publicly accessible bar, café, and museum located at the foundation's headquarters in San Francisco. It serves as a social space for conversation and exhibits that promote long-term thinking. 

Broader influence
The Long Now Foundation has inspired several related projects and concepts:
- Revive & Restore: An organization that spun off from the foundation, focusing on genetic engineering projects, including the de-extinction of species.
- Use of 5-digit dates: To help visualize a 10,000-year timeframe, the foundation uses a five-digit year format (e.g., 02025) to solve the "Year 10,000 problem". 
Through its physical projects, events, and philosophical ideas, the Long Now Foundation seeks to reframe humanity's relationship with time and inspire responsibility for a deep and uncertain future.

## machine_learning_street_talk

*Path: 0/interviewers/ai/machine_learning_street_talk*

Hello! Tim Scarfe speaking here. You have reached our little corner of the internet.

Who Are We?

"Machine Learning Street Talk" co-hosts Tim Scarfe and Keith Duggar.
Dr. Tim Scarfe (left) started a successful software startup called Dot Net Solutions back in 2003, he has done stints at Microsoft as a Principal Engineer, Chief Data Scientist at bp, and founded several other tech startups and has a Ph.D in machine learning and a first-class degree in computer science.

Dr. Keith Duggar (right) who is often a co-interviewer on MLST — obtained his Ph.D from MIT and has done stints at IBM research, Wall Street, and Microsoft.

What is the ethos of MLST?

Intellectual curiosity.

We want to understand a broad range of views in the AI space, and this often involves getting our hands dirty — traversing deep and muddy philosophical trenches which undergird various ideas. We were covering many popular techniques years before they became mainstream, whether it was LLMs, active inference, neurosymbolic models or open-endedness.

Earlier on we were slightly more engineering-focussed and have drifted towards the theoretical since Yannic Kilcher’s departure but we may row back on that soon. Make no mistake though, we are engineers at heart. We often ground our analysis in computability theory, Physics, Bayesianism and cognitive philosophy. We often shift focus for periods of time, for example we have spent a lot of focus on Active Inference and Cognitive Science recently, before that — Linguistics.

We are in the extremely rare position that our salary does not depend on our technical opinion. We have the freedom to make content about anything which interests us. We love deep learning, but you won’t hear all the usual “tech bro” hype from us. We discovered the political “fault lines” of the AI community early on, it can be very hard to be opinionated and speak with a diverse group of people, but we will try our best to regardless.

The history of MLST and exciting news for 2024.

Machine Learning Street Talk grew out of a project which we started at Microsoft in 2018 called “Paper review calls”. We would run these fun weekly calls dissecting academic papers, often getting the actual researchers to present their work if from MSR. Sometimes - hundreds of Microsofties would join the calls! It was a rich community of some 6000 people, and Tim was recognised as the machine learning community champion of the year there in 2019. Admittedly, some of the recordings were cringeworthy but it was an incredible learning experience.

We launched the current incarnation of the project at the beginning of Covid in March 2021, teaming up with other fledgling YouTubers Yannic Kilcher and Connor Shorten. After about 60 episodes, Connor and Yannic departed to focus on their own personal projects — leaving Tim Scarfe running MLST with Keith Duggar on as a regular co-host. Keith and Tim co-founded a augmented reality company in 2021 which has taken up almost all of their time, so for much of 2023 MLST was in a bit of a holding pattern.

Doing MLST full-time in 2024

Tim Speaking. Here we are in 2024, and everything is about to change. Now that we have finished building the core technology for my startup company I co-founded with Keith — I have decided to step back and dedicate my full time and attention to MLST!

MLST was just a weekend project for me, but I have already built it up to be the number one technical AI podcast on Spotify — and we are about to hit 100K subscribers on YouTube, which is phenomenal!

This is only the beginning, the future will be exciting.

## pursuit_of_wonder

*Path: 0/creators/pursuit_of_wonder*

Pursuit of Wonder was created by Robert Pantano, a writer and author who initially planned to publish a book exploring philosophical ideas about meaning, self, and existence. After facing rejection from traditional publishers, he decided to create a YouTube channel to share his work.

Background and origins
- The book that wasn't: Pantano's initial project was a manuscript inspired by the feeling that important aspects of living an authentic life were not being adequately discussed. When it was rejected by agents and publishers, he chose to independently share its concepts through video essays on YouTube.
- The channel is born: The Pursuit of Wonder YouTube channel was established as a vehicle for sharing these philosophical ideas in an engaging and accessible way. Its success allowed the project to expand beyond video content.
- Evolution of purpose: What began as a personal drive to pursue curiosity evolved into a broader mission. The project now aims to "foster reflection through powerful ideas and stories" related to philosophy, psychology, science, literature, and well-being.

Key themes and approach
- Accessible philosophy: The content explores complex concepts from various philosophical traditions, including nihilism, existentialism, and Eastern philosophy, but presents them in a way that is easy for a general audience to grasp.
- Stories and thought experiments: Many videos are short, fictional stories or thought experiments designed to challenge viewers' perspectives on fundamental questions, such as the nature of reality, identity, and consciousness.
- Embracing uncertainty: A core theme is encouraging a comfort with the absurdity and uncertainty of existence. By facing life's complexities head-on, the project aims to inspire a sense of "child-like wonder".

Expansion into publishing
- Author Robert Pantano: Building on the channel's success, Pantano began publishing books under the Pursuit of Wonder umbrella. His first book, The Art of Living a Meaningless Existence, is a collection of essays based on the ideas from his original manuscript.
- Future releases: Pantano has continued to write and publish, with a new book, The Terrible Paradox of Self-Awareness, set for release in 2026.
- Collaborations: The brand has also expanded to include works by other authors. In 2024, Pursuit of Wonder published So You're Having an Existential Crisis, the debut book by Ben Thomas (known as Sisyphus 55).
