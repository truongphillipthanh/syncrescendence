## SUTRA

Two critical revisions: content pace 7→14 pieces via batch production + AI collaboration; consulting protocols specifying 3 tiers ($3K-50K), acquisition strategy, delivery protocols enabling realistic revenue.

---

## GLOSS

This enhancement resolves operational realism gaps in Business Operations Backbone. Content production pace revised from insufficient 7 pieces (sub-weekly) to algorithm-viable 14 pieces (weekly+) using batch production and AI collaboration. Consulting protocols fully specified with three tiers (Sprint, Program, Partnership), pricing philosophy, acquisition strategy per phase, delivery protocols, and risk management. Revenue projections calibrated to realistic timelines: meaningful revenue Month 4+, consulting closes Month 6-9.
