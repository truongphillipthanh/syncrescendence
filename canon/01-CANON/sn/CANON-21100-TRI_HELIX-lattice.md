# Κ-21100: Tri-Helical Timeline (SN)

TERM ThreeTimelines:
    sutra: "Tech maturity (external) + Business development (controlled) + Personal capability (cultivated)—must align"
    gloss:
        Three interdependent timelines must synchronize: Technological Maturity
        (external pacing clock, zero control), Business Development (operational
        execution, high control), Personal Capability (founder development,
        medium control requiring patience). Misalignment causes premature
        attempts, missed windows, strategic confusion.
    spec:
        Timeline_1_Technology:
            control: ZERO | adapt_to_this | cannot_create
            function: determines_WHEN_activities_become_viable

PROC SynchronizationMatrix:
    sutra: "Content aligns with tech maturity, curriculum with personal capability, revenue with demonstrated competence"
    gloss:
        Three alignment patterns: Content Production (business + technology),
        Curriculum Complexity (business + personal), Revenue Scaling (business
        + personal). Each has specific gates and timing requirements.
    spec:
        Content_Production_Strategy:
            Months_1-12:
                tech: Text_AI_85%_mature

                teachable: conceptual_frameworks | no_mastery_proof_required

            Infrastructure: year_3+ | proves_systematic_scalability
end

PROC DecisionGrounding:
    sutra: "Every decision checks all three timelines—if not aligned, identify what's blocking"
    gloss:
        Strategic decisions reference tri-helical logic: check technology
        maturity, business phase appropriateness, personal capability readiness.
        If not aligned, identify blocking timeline and when alignment will occur.
    spec:
        decision_protocol:
            1: what_timeline_dimension_does_this_depend_on
            2: are_all_relevant_timelines_aligned
            3: if_not_aligned_what_is_blocking | Tech_Business_Personal
            4: when_will_alignment_occur | use_timeline_coordinates
            5: what_preparation_enables_readiness
        example_video_content:
            check_Timeline_1: Vision_AI_mature_enough | 40%_now >> threshold_Month_6-9
            check_Timeline_2: does_current_phase_require | Foundation=no | Scaling=yes
            check_Timeline_3: visual_production_competence | develop_if_no
            answer: prepare_Month_1-6 | begin_Month_6-9_when_all_align
        example_Stage_3_curriculum:
            check_Timeline_3: HVAC_mastery | Year_2+
            check_Timeline_2: Institute_Phase | Year_2+
            check_Timeline_1: Physical_AI_30%+ | Year_2
            answer: Year_2_earliest_when_ALL_THREE_align
end

TERM AntiPatterns:
    sutra: "Ignoring any timeline = failure; arbitrary choices, impatience, missed windows"
    gloss:
        Three failure modes: ignoring Technology (video Month 1 = wasted effort),
        ignoring Business (consulting Month 2 = no trust), ignoring Personal
        (teaching physical Year 1 = no authenticity). Common errors: arbitrary
        choices, impatience, missed windows.
    spec:
        Ignoring_Technology:
            - video_content_Month_1_when_tools_immature >> wasted_effort
            - delaying_text_when_AI_mature >> missed_window
            - physical_curriculum_before_robotics >> premature_failure
        Ignoring_Business:
            - consulting_Month_2 >> no_expertise_proof
            - scaling_before_validation >> propagating_unproven
            - infrastructure_before_capital >> premature_collapse
        Ignoring_Personal:
            - teaching_physical_Year_1 >> lack_authenticity
            - claiming_mastery_without_competence >> credibility_destruction
            - forcing_pace >> burnout_quality_collapse
        common_errors:
            Arbitrary_Choices: no_timeline_grounding
            Impatience: forcing_timelines | Year_2_outcomes_in_Month_6
            Missed_Windows: ignoring_timelines | not_preparing_for_maturation
end

ARTIFACT TimelineSynchronization:
    sutra: "Timelines are reality constraints—when aligned, action becomes clear. Patience from awareness."
    gloss:
        Tri-helical thinking transforms confusion into grounded decisions.
        Cannot use technology before maturity, generate revenue before capability
        proven, teach what not mastered. When timelines align, action clear.
        Strategic patience from timeline awareness.
    spec:
        reality_constraints:
            - cannot_use_technology_before_maturity | Timeline_1
            - cannot_generate_revenue_before_capability_proven | Timeline_2
