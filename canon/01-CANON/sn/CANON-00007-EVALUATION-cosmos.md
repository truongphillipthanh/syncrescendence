    gloss:
        Framework commits to scientific rigor while honoring experiential depth.
        30 irresolutions acknowledge what remains unproven. Validation architecture

    gloss:
        Individual metrics specify thresholds for Seven Pulses progression, chain

    sutra: "50% second-gen success matching first-gen baseline—framework transfers"
    gloss:
        Transmission metrics evaluate teaching capacity, framework contributions,
        second-generation outcomes, network effects. Ultimate test: can framework

PROC EvidenceCollectionProtocols:
    sutra: "Triangulate self-report + peer + instructor—accept irreducible uncertainty"
    gloss:
        Quantitative streams (pulses, level assessments, adherence, economics)
        combined with qualitative (interviews, narratives, failures, successes).
        Triangulated assessment required at major checkpoints.
    spec:

TERM HonestAssessmentCommitment:
    sutra: "Publish all data, null results equal prominence—credibility through transparency"
    gloss:
        Framework credibility requires transparent reporting: all data published,
        null results foregrounded, failure rates honest, uncertainty acknowledged,
        adversarial collaboration welcomed.

PASS FailureModeRecognition:
    sutra: "Individual burnout to framework ossification—document all failure patterns"
    gloss:
        Three scales of failure require documentation: individual (burnout,
        fragmentation, bypassing), communal (guru dynamics, in-group superiority),
        framework (founder effect, measurement capture, obsolescence).

PASS ResistanceNavigation:
    sutra: "Academic/spiritual/pragmatic/skeptical—adjust register without losing substance"
    gloss:
        Four resistance profiles with navigation strategies: academic (too woo-woo),
        spiritual (too reductionist), pragmatic (too complex), skeptical (show
        me data). Language register adjusts while maintaining core content.

TERM ThirtyIrresolutions:
    sutra: "30 honest acknowledgments of what remains unknown, unproven, uncertain"
    gloss:
        Irresolutions are not weaknesses to hide but honest acknowledgment.
        Three primary: measurement paradox (instruments don't exist), developmental
        reification (stages may be fiction), cosmological necessity (mythology optional?).
