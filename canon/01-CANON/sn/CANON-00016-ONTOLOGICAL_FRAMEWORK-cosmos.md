# Κ-00016: Ontological Framework (SN)

TERM FrameworkPurpose:
    sutra: "Coordinate system for mapping any human experience—navigation tool, not belief system"
    gloss:
        Provides coordinates for locating any aspect of human experience and
        capability. Ontological substrate supporting all chain developments.
        NOT belief system to adopt but navigation tool for understanding,
        evaluating, integrating worldviews.
    spec:
        function: coordinate_system | mapping_human_experience
        relationship: substrate_supporting_all_chains | I >> W

        Pillars (Being, Purpose, Knowing, Form), Central Fountain (Information
        as Living Water, 15 streams), Recursive Architecture (any chamber
        contains complete palace in miniature).
