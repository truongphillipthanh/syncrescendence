TERM StrategicFramework:
    sutra: "Six orthogonal dimensions—any combination valid, impossible constraints violate design"
    gloss:
        Master Terminology Schema establishes six independent dimensions. Understanding
        their orthogonality prevents conceptual contamination. Multiple modals
        active within single Phase—dimensions combine freely.
    spec:
        dimensions:
            Scale: [1-4] | Micro/Meso/Macro/Meta | practitioner_cosmological_sophistication
            Level: [1-4] | Initial/Intermediate/Advanced/Mastery | chain_progression
            Degree: [0-5] | Latent >> Transmission | lunar_mastery_only
            Stage: [1-5] | Forum >> Portico | platform_maturity
            Phase: Foundation >> Infrastructure | business_timeline
            Modal: [1-4] | Abstraction >> Transcendence | technology_progression
        orthogonality_principle: dimensions_completely_independent | any_combination_valid
end

PROC ProgressiveDisclosure:
    sutra: "Seven Pulses universal entry—complexity reveals as capacity builds"
    gloss:
        Multi-tier presentation enables appropriate entry. Seven Pulses serves
        all scales. Practitioners progressively reveal deeper layers as capacity
        develops. Scale advancement optional—no hierarchical superiority.
    spec:
        Scale_1-Micro:
            - four_virtues | seven_pulses | six_chains
            - zero_cosmological_imagery

end

PROC DualTrackDevelopment:
    sutra: "Primary chain natural strength, complementary chain optional integration"
    gloss:
        Practitioners advance independently through six chains. Primary track
        develops strongest chain to Level 3+ minimum. Complementary track
        creates synergy. Integration optional after Level 2 in primary.
    spec:
        Primary_Track:
            - select_strongest_chain
            - advance_Level_1>>4 | individual_pace
            - reach_Level_3_minimum | teaching_capacity
            - honors_individual_rhythm
        Complementary_Track:
            - select_second_chain_supporting_primary
            - parallel_advancement
            - less_demanding_than_dual_mastery
        Integration:
            - after_Level_2_in_primary | optional
            - Scale_3-Macro_becomes_meaningful
            - Strategic_Harmony_emerges_from_maturity | not_enforced
        outcome: genuine_expertise_primary + secondary_capability + optional_cosmology

    sutra: "Foundation through Infrastructure—15+ year trajectory respecting Modal readiness"
    gloss:
        Five phases map to Modal Sequence but aren't identical. Multiple modals
        active within single Phase. Technology readiness determines modal
        transition, not arbitrary timeline.

        unlocks when underlying technology matures. Learning preparation
        overlaps—study cinematography during Modal 1.

TERM PlanetaryCorrespondence:
    sutra: "Six chains map to planets—Mercury fastest to Saturn/Kuiper outermost"
    gloss:
        Chains correspond to planetary bodies in nested orbital architecture.
        Strategic Harmony (Sun) unifies all six. Elemental alignment (Air/Water/
        Fire/Earth/Quintessence) informs organizational function.
