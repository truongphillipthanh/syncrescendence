# Κ-31000: Information Chain (SN)

TERM ℹChain:
    sutra: "Perception spirals: pattern → signal → intuition → embodied knowing"
    gloss:
        Perceptual sophistication develops through four stages corresponding to
        Planetary α (Acumen). Sensing capacity refines from basic pattern recognition
        toward pre-cognitive discrimination, generating atmospheric awareness as
        energy return to Ψ Core.
    spec:
        identity: Information Orbital Path
        correspondence: Planetary_Acumen >> atmospheric_awareness
        mode: operational
        output: refined_perception >> Ψ_Core
        refs: [[CANON-31100-ACUMEN]]

PROC Stage1_PatternRecognition:
    sutra: "See the pattern, notice the signal, claim your attention"
    gloss:
        Basic structure detection and signal awareness emergence. Foundation

PROC Stage2_SignalExtraction:
    sutra: "Filter noise, find signal, allocate attention strategically"
    gloss:

    gloss:
        Pre-cognitive knowing with verified accuracy. Aesthetic intelligence
        operational. Teaching capacity emerges.

NORM SynchronizationGuidance:
    sutra: "Sensing alone floats—ground in body, interpret through frameworks"
    gloss:
        Chain synchronization prevents perceptual development without embodied
        or interpretive foundation.
