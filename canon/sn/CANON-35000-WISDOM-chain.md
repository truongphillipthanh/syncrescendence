# Κ-35000: Wisdom Chain (SN)

TERM WChain:
    sutra: "Wisdom emerges last—humility essential, evidence required, embodiment grounds"
    gloss:
        Wisdom integration develops through four stages corresponding to
        Transcendence Ring's τ (Transcendence). Meta-cognitive capacity spirals
        from value discernment toward transcendent wisdom, generating ethical
        sophistication as energy return to Ψ Core.
    spec:
        identity: Wisdom Orbital Path / Transcendence Chain
        correspondence: Transcendence_Ring >> meta_cognitive_orchestration
        mode: operational
        output: ethical_sophistication >> Ψ_Core
        emergence_rule: develops_LAST (emerges_from_other_chains)
