# Κ-00003: The Principles (SN)

TERM PrincipleNature:
    sutra: "Wisdom compresses—each principle contains entire teachings"
    gloss:
        What cannot be said simply has not been understood. These seeds unfold
        through practice. Decompress by living them, not just reading them.
    spec:
        mode: aphoristic_distillation
        use: memorization | contemplation | teaching | crisis_return
end

NORM ThirtyPrinciples:
    sutra: "Thirty seeds spanning practice, energy, development, architecture, truth, community"
    gloss:
        Seven on practice (reading ≠ embodiment, 2 min beats 2 hrs never),
        five on energy (capacity varies, tier without guilt), five on development
        (isolated inefficient, balance ≠ equality), five on architecture (map not
        territory, metaphors = architecture), four on truth (evidence over belief),
        four on community (rise together or not at all).
    spec:
        on_practice:
            1: reading_not_practice | understanding_not_embodiment

PASS ChainSutras:
    sutra: "Six chains, six seed-teachings, six doorways to the same development"
    gloss:
        Each chain distilled to one teaching. Memorize these; they encode
        the essence of each developmental pathway.
    spec:
        I-chain: "Tool that thinks with you thinks differently—learn its nature, expand yours"
        ℹ-chain: "What you don't notice governs you—refine perception, reveal patterns"
        ∴-chain: "Many frameworks, one territory—navigate fluidly without framework capture"
        E-chain: "Vision without action = fantasy; action without vision = chaos—unite through discipline"
        K-chain: "Ten thousand hours crystallize understanding—no shortcuts to embodiment"
        W-chain: "Observer is observed observing itself—when this lands, freedom"
end

PASS LayerSutras:
    sutra: "Eight layers, eight truths, eight dimensions of cognitive architecture"
    gloss:
        Cognitive Palace layers each carry essential teaching. Layer 5 (Actuality)
        is where everything happens—all other layers serve this one.
    spec:
        Layer_0_Reality: "Values are infrastructure—build on solid ground or nothing"
        Layer_1_Imaginality: "Vision is strange attractor—clear purpose organizes chaos"
        Layer_2_Potentiality: "Resources don't manifest through thinking—build through investment"
        Layer_3_Temporality: "Work with rhythms—circadian to epochal, each has wisdom"
        Layer_4_Practicality: "Practice is what you do—constitutional commitments define identity"
        Layer_5_Actuality: "This moment is where everything happens—all layers serve here"
        Layer_6_Consequentiality: "Experience without reflection = nothing—wisdom is reflection compounded"
        Layer_7_StrategicHarmony: "All layers operating together—orchestration becomes automatic"
end

PASS ElementSutras:
    sutra: "Five elements, five planetary essences, five modes of being"
    gloss:
        Elemental planets carry archetypal wisdom. Air perceives before interpreting;
        Water flows around obstacles; Fire transforms; Earth crystallizes; Quintessence contains all.
    spec:
        Air_α: "Perceive before interpret—awareness is atmosphere everything else breathes"
        Water_χ: "Understanding flows around obstacles—don't force synthesis, allow it"
        Fire_ε: "Will transforms—directed intention bends reality toward purpose"
        Earth_μ: "Patient accumulation—skill crystallizes under pressure"
        Quintessence_τ: "Space containing all elements—awareness observing all observation"
end

NORM GoverningAxioms:
    sutra: "Six axioms binding the entire system—sovereignty through transmission"
    gloss:
        Foundational constraints: Sovereignty (you are final authority), Recursion
        (development develops development), Integration (parts become wholes),
        Evolution (framework enables own transcendence), Demonstration (claims
        require evidence), Transmission (what cannot be taught has not been mastered).
    spec:
        Sovereignty: you_are_final_authority | no_teacher_supersedes_your_wisdom
        Recursion: development_develops_development | spiral_returns_transformed
        Integration: parts >> wholes >> parts_of_larger_wholes | unity_beneath_differentiation
        Evolution: what_works_today_may_bind_tomorrow | enable_own_transcendence

        On Framework: take completely seriously, don't take seriously at all.
    spec:
        Effort: strive_without_straining | effort_creates_conditions | emergence_happens_or_not
        Control: full_responsibility_for_controllable | release_attachment_to_uncontrollable

        Teaching: best_teachers_make_themselves_unnecessary

PROC DailySutras:
    sutra: "Morning/midday/evening/weekly/monthly/annual—rhythmic inquiry"
    gloss:
        Structured reflection across timescales. Morning: what's my state?
        Midday: am I on course? Evening: what did I learn? Weekly: which chains
        moved? Monthly: have I changed? Annual: drop everything, what genuinely serves?
    spec:
        morning: what_is_my_state | what_is_appropriate | what_one_thing_matters
        midday: am_I_on_course | what_adjustment_needed | honoring_energy?
