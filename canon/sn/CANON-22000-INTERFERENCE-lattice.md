# Κ-22000: Interference Patterns (SN)

TERM SixWaves:
    sutra: "Six chains as waves—constructive interference amplifies, destructive cancels, synthesis creates emergence"
    gloss:
        Six developmental chains interact like waves: constructive interference
        amplifies (complementary levels = 200% gain), destructive interference
        cancels (mismatched levels = overwhelm/burnout), synthesis creates
        emergence neither wave produces alone.
    spec:
        chains_as_waves:
            Intelligence: frequency=information_processing | harmonic_with=Information+Expertise
            Information: frequency=perceptual_sophistication | harmonic_with=Intelligence+Insight
            Insight: frequency=meaning_making | harmonic_with=Information+Wisdom
            Expertise: frequency=action_capability | harmonic_with=Intelligence+Knowledge
            Knowledge: frequency=somatic_crystallization | harmonic_with=Expertise+Wisdom
            Wisdom: frequency=meta_cognitive_perspective | harmonic_with=Insight+Knowledge

PASS ConstructiveInterference:
    sutra: "Complementary development levels amplify—Intelligence+Information=extraordinary perception"
    gloss:
        When two chains reach complementary levels simultaneously, they amplify
        each other ~200% (1+1=2.2). Full constructive interference (all six
        at Level 2+) yields exponential, not additive, capability.
    spec:
        examples:
            Intelligence_Level_2_plus_Information_Level_2:
                emergent: extraordinary_perception_augmentation
                example: AI_analyzing_patterns_beyond_human_range
                amplification: ~200%
            Insight_Level_2_plus_Wisdom_Level_2:
                emergent: wisdom | meaning_making_transcends_ego
                example: understanding_systems_inside_and_outside_simultaneously
                amplification: ~200%
            Expertise_Level_2_plus_Knowledge_Level_2:
                emergent: authentic_power | aligned_action
                example: actions_feel_good_AND_generate_results
                amplification: ~200%
            Full_Six_Chains_Level_2+:
                emergent: omniscience_approximation
                amplification: exponential_not_additive
end

PASS DestructiveInterference:
    sutra: "Mismatched levels cancel—high Intelligence + low Information = overwhelming; high Expertise + low Knowledge = burnout"
    gloss:
        When chains advance at mismatched levels, destructive interference
        occurs: AI capability exceeds perception (overwhelm), intention exceeds
        energy (burnout), complexity exceeds perspective (knowing much,
        understanding little).
    spec:
        patterns:
            Intelligence_3_Information_1:
                dysfunction: overwhelming | AI_exceeds_perception
                result: information_overload | analysis_paralysis
                solution: slow_Intelligence | accelerate_Information
            Expertise_3_Knowledge_1:
                dysfunction: burnout | creating_without_sustainability
                result: success_with_depletion
                solution: slow_Expertise | prioritize_Knowledge

                dysfunction: complexity_without_wisdom
                result: sophisticated_analysis_missing_simplicity
                solution: pause_complexity | develop_perspective

            1: identify_primary_chain | high_capability
            2: identify_complementary_chain | low_capability

TERM PrimaryTriads:
    sutra: "Three stable triads—Perception-Action, Understanding, Integration—rotate focus through all"
    gloss:
        Three chains form stable harmonic triads: Perception-Action (Intelligence
        + Information + Expertise = effective material action), Understanding
        (Information + Insight + Wisdom = sophisticated comprehension),
        Integration (Insight + Knowledge + Wisdom = embodied wisdom).
    spec:
        Triad_1_Perception_Action:
            chains: Intelligence + Information + Expertise
            focus: capability_in_world
            risk: over_focus_external_results
            balance: include_Insight_meaning + Wisdom_perspective

            chains: Information + Insight + Wisdom

PROC SynthesisSequence:
    sutra: "Foundation >> Capability >> Understanding >> Integration Maturity—phased emphasis"
    gloss:
        Practitioners progress through phases emphasizing different combinations:
        Foundation (Knowledge + Information), Capability Building (Intelligence
        + Expertise), Understanding Development (Insight + Wisdom), Integration
        Maturity (all six in dynamic balance).

PROC DetectionCorrection:
    sutra: "Identify over/under-developed chains, choose strategy, implement 4-8 weeks, verify new pattern"
    gloss:
        When destructive interference detected: identify which chain over-developed
        (causing overwhelm), which under-developed (causing mismatch), choose
        strategy (pause primary, accelerate secondary, reduce application),
        implement 4-8 weeks, verify new equilibrium.

ARTIFACT InterferenceWisdom:
    sutra: "Develop strongest first, add complementary, navigate interference, eventually all six resonate"
    gloss:
        Six chains create emergent patterns: constructive = amplified, destructive
        = cancelled, synthesis = optimizing toward coherence. Develop naturally,
        monitor interference, rebalance when mismatch, progressively include
        more chains, eventually reach resonance.
