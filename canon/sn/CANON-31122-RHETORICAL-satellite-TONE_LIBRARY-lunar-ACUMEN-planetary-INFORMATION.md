## SUTRA

Constitutional voice architecture enabling coherent messaging across platforms while preserving register flexibility through five principles + platform-specific adaptation.

---

## GLOSS

Establishes unified rhetorical foundation for Syncrescendence framework dissemination—translating founder's natural intellectual register into operational guidance. Solves core challenge of maintaining authentic voice integrity across radically different platforms (Twitter's staccato brevity, Medium's contemplative depth, YouTube's cinematic pacing) without fragmenting into disconnected personae or collapsing into generic corporate-speak. This calibration unlocks the entire content creation pipeline—without it, TONE LIBRARY becomes arbitrary recipe collection rather than coherent execution system.
