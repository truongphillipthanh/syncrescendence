## SUTRA

Exhaustive operational specifications for five IICs—from cognitive personality through platform grammar to maintenance rhythms—enabling immediate implementation.

---

## GLOSS

Where CANON-31140 establishes architectural principles, this satellite delivers operational implementation details for each IIC modality. Provides complete cognitive personality specifications, platform grammars, content flow architectures, automation thresholds, curation philosophies, and maintenance protocols. These specifications are not theoretical—they represent operational intelligence systems refined through practice. Each IIC description integrates architectural vision with tactical implementation guidance.
