# Κ-34000: Knowledge Chain (SN)

TERM KChain:
    sutra: "Show don't tell—demonstration over claims, practice over planning"
    gloss:
        Capability crystallization develops through four stages corresponding to
        Planetary μ (Mastery). Embodied competence spirals from conceptual learning
        toward mastery teaching, generating tangible capability as energy return
        to Ψ Core.
    spec:
        identity: Knowledge Orbital Path / Embodiment Chain
        correspondence: Planetary_Mastery >> solid_competence
        mode: operational
        output: tangible_capability >> Ψ_Core
