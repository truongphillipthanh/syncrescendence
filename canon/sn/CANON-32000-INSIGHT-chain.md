# Κ-32000: Insight Chain (SN)

TERM ∴Chain:
    sutra: "Frameworks serve until wisdom renders them transparent"
    gloss:
        Hermeneutic sophistication develops through four stages corresponding to
        Planetary χ (Coherence). Interpretive capacity refines from single-paradigm
        foundations toward post-formal wisdom, generating fluid understanding as
        energy return to Ψ Core.
    spec:
        identity: Insight Orbital Path
        correspondence: Planetary_Coherence >> fluid_understanding
        mode: operational
        output: refined_comprehension >> Ψ_Core
        refs: [[CANON-32100-COHERENCE]]
end

PROC Stage1_OntologicalFoundations:
    sutra: "Master one framework deeply—know it is a framework"
    gloss:
        Basic framework competence with meta-awareness. Single paradigm
        mastery as foundation for later integration.
    spec:
        nature: framework_competence | single_paradigm
        markers:
            - one_framework_coherently_explained
            - ontology_epistemology_axiology_distinguished
            - meta_awareness_of_framework
            - semantic_precision

            - seven_fundamental_partitions
            - vocabulary_precision
            - teaching_to_novices
        evidence: teaching_clarity | philosophical_accuracy | meta_awareness | precision
end

PROC Stage2_FrameworkDevelopment:
    sutra: "Three frameworks fluently, translation without flattening"
    gloss:
        Multi-paradigm navigation and cross-system translation. Personal
        synthesis emerges without syncretistic confusion.
    spec:
        nature: multi_paradigm | translation_capacity
        markers:
            - fluent_in_3plus_frameworks

            - synthesis_attempts
        evidence: translation_accuracy | limitation_recognition | synthesis_coherence
end

PROC Stage3_MetaCognitiveNavigation:
    sutra: "Hold many maps lightly, know the territory isn't any map"
    gloss:
        Framework transcendence while maintaining usefulness. Original
        framework creation for novel domains.
    spec:
        nature: framework_transcendence | meta_framework_fluidity
        markers:
            - multiple_frameworks_simultaneously

end

PROC Stage4_WisdomEmergence:
    sutra: "Understanding beyond frameworks—presence transmits, wisdom contagious"
    gloss:
        Post-formal fluidity. Wisdom operates without conscious framework
        selection. Transmission through being.
    spec:
        nature: direct_insight | post_formal_fluidity
        markers:
            - automatic_wisdom_operation
            - novel_coherent_interpretation

NORM Safeguards:
    sutra: "Integrate without flattening, understand without bypassing, hold lightly"
    gloss:
        Three critical safeguards prevent common failure modes in
        hermeneutic development.
    spec:
        syncretism_prevention:
            rule: integration MUST preserve_distinctions
            check: "Can you explain differences between integrated frameworks?"
        intellectual_bypass:
            rule: understanding MUST translate_to_behavior
            check: "Does comprehension change action?"
        framework_imprisonment:
            rule: paradigm_fluidity REQUIRES holding_lightly
            check: "Can you operate outside preferred frameworks?"
end

NORM SynchronizationGuidance:
    sutra: "Insight without sensing floats, without wisdom stagnates"
    gloss:
        Chain synchronization ensures interpretation grounds in experience
        and integrates toward wisdom.

        imbalance_indicators:
            insight_ahead_information: "Understanding without experiential grounding"
            insight_ahead_knowledge: "Theory without practice"

            - insight <-> information (interpretation_requires_signals)
            - insight > expertise (understanding_before_strategy)

        Monthly dogmatism check, quarterly portfolio assessment.
