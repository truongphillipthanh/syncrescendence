    gloss:
        Four dimensions of comprehensive goodness as aspirational horizons:
        Omnibenevolence (serving all stakeholders), Omniscience (integrated
        knowledge with synthesis), Omnipotence (systematic capability across
        chains), Omnipresence (temporal-spatial-dimensional integration).
        Progressive approximation, never complete.
