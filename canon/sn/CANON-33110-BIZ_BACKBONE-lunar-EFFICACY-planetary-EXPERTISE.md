## SUTRA

Four-level progression: Initial (planning) → Intermediate (first revenue) → Advanced (sustainable) → Mastery (teaching L2+)—systematic operations scaling from strategic excellence to civilizational contribution.

---

## GLOSS

Business Operations Backbone provides systematic framework for economic capability development through Level 1-4 trajectory with explicit prerequisites, daily/weekly/monthly protocols, and assessment templates. Each level specifies timeline, essential competencies, practices, advancement criteria, and critical gates. Framework integration maintains orthogonality with Scale (sophistication), Stage (platform maturity), Degree (lunar mastery), and Phase (business timeline) dimensions.
