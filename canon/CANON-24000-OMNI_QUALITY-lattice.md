## PART I: OMNIBENEVOLENCE CULTIVATION

### Definition
Capacity to serve all stakeholders comprehensively, grounded in ethical sophistication and commitment to collective flourishing.

### Four-Stage Development

**Stage 1: Ethical Foundation (Months 1-3)**

*Objective*: Establish baseline ethical awareness

- Value system clarification (personal ethics articulated)
- Stakeholder mapping (who's affected by your actions?)
- Shadow work initiation (unconscious patterns recognized)
- Ethical reading/study (philosophy, wisdom traditions)

*Assessment*: Can you name your core values? Identify your blind spots?

**Stage 2: Conscious Practice (Months 3-12)**

*Objective*: Integrate ethics into decision-making

- Decision postmortem analysis (review impact)
- Multi-stakeholder consideration (think beyond self)
- Harm reduction protocols (minimize collateral damage)
- Accountability structures (wisdom council, mentor)

*Assessment*: Do decisions increasingly serve collective good? Evidence of impact?

**Stage 3: Systems Goodness (Year 2-3)**

*Objective*: Design structures enabling flourishing

- System design competence (create environments that serve others)
- Institutional ethics contribution (influence organizational culture)
- Regenerative modeling (contribution exceeds extraction)
- Second-generation cultivation (teach others ethical development)

*Assessment*: Are systems you create enabling flourishing? Teaching effective?

**Stage 4: Transmission & Innovation (Year 3+)**

*Objective*: Advance collective ethical capacity

- Teaching sophisticated ethical reasoning
- Framework contributions (advance ethics field)
- Institutional stewardship (shape civilization-scale ethics)
- Wisdom tradition participation (preserve/evolve ethical wisdom)

*Assessment*: Are second-generation practitioners emerging? Framework evolving?

---

## PART II: OMNISCIENCE CULTIVATION

### Definition
Integrated knowledge across domains with capacity for synthesis, pattern recognition, and sophisticated understanding.

### Prerequisite
**Intelligence Chain: Level: 1-Initial minimum** (AI collaboration enables knowledge amplification)

### Four-Stage Development

**Stage 1: Foundation Knowledge (Months 1-6)**

*Objective*: Establish breadth across domains

- Multi-domain exposure (4+ fields studied)
- Framework literacy (understand 3-5 major models)
- Synthesis practices (connect ideas across domains)
- Epistemic humility (recognize knowledge limitations)

*Assessment*: Can you articulate connections between domains? Framework conversant?

**Stage 2: Integrative Understanding (6-18 Months)**

*Objective*: Develop sophisticated synthesis capacity

- Deep domain expertise (master 1-2 fields)
- Cross-domain pattern recognition (similarities between fields)
- Meta-framework development (personal synthesis emerging)
- Teaching ability (explain complexity clearly)

*Assessment*: Novel insights emerging? Can teach others? Unique perspectives evident?

**Stage 3: Sophisticated Synthesis (Year 2-4)**

*Objective*: Create original frameworks integrating knowledge

- Novel framework articulation
- Multi-domain problem-solving
- Wisdom integration (connect knowledge with being)
- Civilization-scale thinking (planetary patterns recognized)

*Assessment*: Frameworks published/adopted? Problem-solving quality superior? Vision planetary-scale?

**Stage 4: Wisdom Teaching (Year 4+)**

*Objective*: Transmit integrated knowledge to next generation

- Second-generation teachers emerging
- Framework evolution through student contributions
- Institutional knowledge stewardship
- Cross-civilizational synthesis

*Assessment*: Teachers teaching? Frameworks evolving? Traditions preserved?

## PART III: OMNIPOTENCE CULTIVATION

### Definition
Systematic capability development across six causal chains generating volitional effectiveness.

### The Six Causal Chains

| Chain | Focus | Level: 4-Mastery Indicates |
|-------|-------|---------------------------|
| **Technology** | Intelligence amplification | AI collaboration mastery |
| **Sensing** | Perceptual sophistication | Pre-cognitive knowing |
| **Coherence** | Conceptual sophistication | Framework fluency |
| **Efficacy** | Economic capability | Sustainable value creation |
| **Embodiment** | Physical mastery | Demonstrated skill excellence |
| **Transcendence** | Meta-cognitive wisdom | Systems orchestration |

### Development Pathways

**Synchronization Track** (Balanced All-Chain Development)  
*Best for*: Neurotypical practitioners, generalists  
*Approach*: Develop all chains Level: 2+ simultaneously

**Specialization Track** (Focus-Chain Depth)  
*Best for*: Neurodivergent practitioners, specialists  
*Approach*: Advance 2-3 chains Level: 3+ while maintaining Level: 1 baseline in others

### Four-Stage Sequence

**Stage 1: Foundation Across All Chains (Months 1-6)**

- Level: 1-Initial in all six chains
- Technology prioritized (enables others)
- Track selection (Synchronization vs. Specialization)

**Stage 2: Coherent Advancement (6-18 Months)**

- **Synchronization**: All chains Level: 2-Intermediate
- **Specialization**: 2-3 chains Level: 2+, others Level: 1 maintained

**Stage 3: Mastery Emergence (Year 2-4)**

- **Synchronization**: 1-3 chains Level: 3-Advanced, others Level: 2+
- **Specialization**: 2-3 chains Level: 3-Advanced, others Level: 1-2

**Stage 4: Integrated Excellence (Year 4+)**

- Multi-chain coordination at Level: 3-4
- Teaching others effective (Level: 2+ demonstrated)
- Innovation emerging from mastery

- Planetary: Civilization perspective (global consciousness)

**Dimensional Integration** (Cognitive Palace)
