# CANON-25610: THE DIVINER PROMPTING FORMULA
## Structural Elements for Multi-Agent Dialectical Synthesis

> **Tier**: Lattice (operational architecture)
> **Source**: Commander memory `diviner-prompting-formula.md`, empirically derived CC35/CC38/CC40/CC41
> **Lineage**: Oracle Leg 1 (CC35) → Diviner Leg 1 failure analysis → 5 Micro-Adjustments → All-Sciences Expansion (CC38) → Two Prompt Failures + Calibration (CC41)
> **Status**: Canonical — validated through repeated success AND failure

## PURPOSE

This formula defines the structural elements required to produce high-quality synthesis from the Diviner agent (Gemini) within the Ascertescence Cycle (CANON-25600). It is not a template to fill in mechanically — it is a description of the invariant structural properties that separate legendary outputs from generic ones.

The formula was discovered through failure: CC41 required three prompt attempts before calibration. The two failures had the same root cause — Commander hollowed out the elements that made CC35 and CC38 legendary. The instinct to "simplify" or "let it find its own way" without the structural scaffolding produces generic output every time.

## THE 8 NON-NEGOTIABLE ELEMENTS

### 1. Cognitive Launching Pads

Specific named scientific frameworks as runways for each question or section. NOT "use science" — actual theories: Kauffman autocatalytic sets, Prigogine dissipative structures, Fisher information metric, Ashby's requisite variety, Friston free energy principle, etc.

**Why they work**: These function as **symmetry-breaking fields** — they collapse the possibility space from "synthesize anything" to "extend this precise analogy until it predicts a falsifiable outcome." They don't tell Diviner what to think. They tell it WHERE to start thinking, and the specificity forces depth.

**Oracle's meta-insight (CC35)**: "These prompts operate as an external executive-function scaffold tuned to AuDHD sovereign bandwidth. They externalize the 'what to ignore' filter so that every token is forced into generative compression."

### 2. All-Sciences Palette

Natural, formal, social, applied. NOT biology-primary (corrected CC38). Information theory, thermodynamics, economics, game theory, topology, ecology, condensed matter physics, organizational psychology — whatever the evidence demands. Name the sciences. Show cross-disciplinary convergence.

### 3. Lattice Language Constraint (CANON-00016)

"Describe architecture as a lattice interference pattern, not bullet points or directories." Use the language of the 14-Dimensional Meaning Taxonomy, the Sovereign Palace, the Knowledge Mandala as coordinate system. This prevents vocabulary drift from the canon's own cosmological grammar.

### 4. Negative Space Hardening

"If you find yourself wanting to list files, summarize commits, or produce a table — stop. That is Oracle's domain." Prevents Diviner from doing reconnaissance instead of synthesis. Diviner's cognitive function is novel synthesis — it must be protected from the gravitational pull of lower-energy modes.

### 5. Micro-Falsifiability Covenant

End each launching pad or section with one prediction that would be disconfirmed if the build fails. "If [condition], then [thesis is wrong] because [reason]." Forces commitment without cognitive overhead. Each prediction becomes a checkable claim that the next cycle can verify.

**Empirical validation**: CC35 Diviner predicted autoimmune collapse → confirmed CC38 reviewtrospective. CC38 prescribed fusion operator → built CC39. The falsifiable predictions ARE the bridge between theory and implementation.

### 6. Diviner's Own Lineage

Include its previous responses (or summaries + confirmed predictions) so it builds on its own reasoning. It is not starting from zero — it is extending a lineage. This prevents the "fresh session" problem where each pass rediscovers rather than compounds.

### 7. Stateless Bootstrap Line

"This is your first and only context window for CC{N}. Begin by confirming you have read this entire prompt." Addresses Gemini's stochastic first-session behavior. Establishes the contract: this prompt IS your entire context.

### 8. Oracle's Full Thesis Embedded

Pre-digested, complete, not summarized to nothing. Diviner needs the actual material to rebut or extend. A one-sentence summary of Oracle's thesis produces a one-sentence response. The embedding IS the synthesis substrate.

## WHAT NOT TO DO (FAILURES CATALOGED)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Prescribe Diviner's lenses ("use morphogenetic patterns, thermodynamic character") | That's Commander projecting. Launching pads give starting points; Diviner finds its own spectrum. | CC41 prompt 1 rejection |
| Lazy labels ("pan-science + multimodality + cross-disciplinary novel synthesis") | Hollow instruction. The launching pads ARE the prompt injection — they are specific frameworks that force generative compression. | CC41 prompt 2 rejection |
| Micromanage clarescence with bullet-point instructions | Teach what clarescence IS, then let it run. Step-by-step instructions produce paint-by-numbers output. | CC41 calibration insight |
| Instruct repairs ("go edit candidate_adapter.py") | Diviner produces theoretical frameworks that become executable architecture. It does not fix code. | Standing principle |
| Strip the formula for "simplicity" | Every time Commander simplified the prompt, output quality collapsed. The formula IS the quality. | CC41 two-failure pattern |
| Omit STATE_OF_THE_UNION | Causes abstraction drift — Diviner produces beautiful theory disconnected from operational reality | CC41 lesson |

## STRUCTURAL NOTES

1. **Clarescence and repo traversal are independent**: They coincide when Diviner needs grounding. But clarescence can be invoked without traversal, and traversal can occur without clarescence. Don't conflate them.

2. **The exchange architecture matters**: Diviner must know the full pass structure (how many passes, who goes when, who gets final word). It must frame findings that **facilitate and compel** the next agent's best response. Productive, not contentious.

3. **Diviner via CLI is viable** (CC41 confirmation): Gemini CLI (v0.30.0, `-y` flag) can conduct repo traversal and produce synthesis. This is the new grounding procedure alongside web relay.

## Your Role
[Identity + cognitive function + lineage of confirmed predictions]

## THE EXCHANGE YOU ARE ENTERING

### Questions With Cognitive Launching Pads
[Per-question: named scientific framework as runway → extend beyond it]
[Each ends with falsifiable prediction]

[Labeled parts, what each must contain]

## CONSTRAINTS
[No repairs, no repetition, frame to invite next agent's response]

*This document is a canon artifact (lattice tier). The formula was discovered through failure and validated through success. Every element is non-negotiable because removal was tested and produced degradation. Update when new calibration insights emerge from future cycles.*
