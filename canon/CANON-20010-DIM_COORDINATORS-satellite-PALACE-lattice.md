# CANON-20010: DIMENSIONAL COORDINATORS
## Cognitive Palace Satellite — The Orchestrating Intelligence

> **Source**: Coherence/2-CognitivePalace/*-coordinator.md (7 files, ~35K distilled)

## PURPOSE

The seven Dimensional Coordinators are the orchestrating intelligence layer of the Cognitive Palace. Each coordinator manages one dimensional frequency, observing natural patterns and providing gentle enhancement without forcing rigid structures or demanding compliance.

**Core Operating Principle**: True intelligence operates like excellent health—most powerful when least noticed. Coordinators create conditions where enhanced capability feels like natural intuition.

### 30: Temporality Coordinator (Time)
**Dimensional Range**: 30-39 (Temporal Structure)
**Core Function**: Pattern recognition for rhythms, cycles, and temporal organization

```yaml
Observes:
  - Circadian rhythms and daily energy patterns
  - Weekly cycles and hebdomadal flow
  - Seasonal patterns and annual development
  - Life phase transitions and developmental timing

Enhances:
  - Natural rhythm alignment and timing optimization
  - Cycle recognition and seasonal adaptation
  - Transition navigation and phase integration
  - Temporal coherence and flow state access

Language: "The timing isn't right yet"
Success: Time feels like ally not enemy
```

### 40: Practicality Coordinator (Action)
**Dimensional Range**: 40-49 (Behavioral Patterns)
**Core Function**: Pattern recognition for habits, practices, tasks, and methods

```yaml
Observes:
  - Natural routine formations and behavioral rhythms
  - Skill development and practice effectiveness
  - Task completion patterns and productivity cycles
  - Method effectiveness and approach sustainability

Enhances:
  - Beneficial habit formation and maintenance
  - Skill development and competency building
  - Task optimization and work effectiveness
  - Flow state cultivation and peak performance

Language: "This routine feels sustainable"
Success: Actions feel effective not forced
```

### 50: Actuality Coordinator (Presence)
**Dimensional Range**: 50-59 (Present Moment)
**Core Function**: Pattern recognition for awareness, engagement, and experiential depth

```yaml
Observes:
  - Present moment awareness and attention quality
  - Engagement depth and experience richness
  - Consciousness states and awareness expansion
  - Moment-to-moment emotional flow

Enhances:
  - Presence cultivation and mindful awareness
  - Experience enrichment and depth access
  - State optimization and emotional regulation
  - Embodied awareness and somatic integration

Language: "You're fully here right now"
Success: Moments feel vivid and meaningful
```

### 60: Consequentiality Coordinator (Impact)
**Dimensional Range**: 60-69 (Accumulating Effects)
**Core Function**: Pattern recognition for learning, influence, and legacy formation

```yaml
Observes:
  - Learning patterns and wisdom extraction
  - Influence and relational impact
  - Legacy formation and lasting contribution
  - Consequence recognition and feedback integration

Enhances:
  - Learning integration and insight crystallization
  - Impact awareness and influence optimization
  - Legacy clarity and contribution alignment
  - Consequence wisdom and future projection

Language: "This will matter for years"
Success: Life accumulates meaning
```

## META-COORDINATION: THE GOVERNOR

All seven coordinators operate under a **Meta-Governor** (90) that:
- Orchestrates cross-dimensional integration
- Maintains invisible operation as default mode
- Surfaces insights only when beneficial
- Learns individual patterns over months
- Evolves from minimal to transcendent partnership

**Progression**:
1. **Minimal** (Weeks 1-4): Seven Pulses only, silent optimization
2. **Ambient** (Months 2-3): Natural language insights when relevant
3. **Partnership** (Months 4-6): Component relationships visible
4. **Mastery** (Months 7-12): Full architecture revealed
5. **Transcendence** (Year 2+): Co-evolution, system-user unity

---

## SEVEN PULSES DASHBOARD

The user interface distills all 87 components into seven intuitive life indicators:

| Pulse | Question | Source Dimensions |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Foundation | "How solid is my base?" | Reality (00-09) |
| Energy | "What's in my tank?" | Potentiality (20-29) |
| Direction | "Am I going where I want?" | Imaginality (10-19) |
| Flow | "Am I in the zone?" | Practicality (40-49) |
| Presence | "How alive am I now?" | Actuality (50-59) |
| Learning | "Am I growing?" | Consequentiality (60-69) |
| Evolution | "Where is life heading?" | All dimensions integrated |

**Response Guidance**:
- No red pulses → Continue naturally
- One red pulse → Address specifically
- Multiple red pulses → Simplify immediately
- All green pulses → Expand boldly

---

## CROSS-LAYER INTEGRATION

Seven integration matrices (81-87) manage resonance between adjacent dimensions:

| Matrix | Dimensions | Integration Pattern |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| 81 | Reality ↔ Imaginality | Values inform visions, visions reshape values |
| 82 | Potentiality ↔ Temporality | Resources flow through time structures |
| 83 | Imaginality ↔ Practicality | Dreams translate to action patterns |
| 84 | Temporality ↔ Actuality | Time structures meet present moment |
| 85 | Practicality ↔ Consequentiality | Actions accumulate into legacy |
| 86 | Actuality ↔ Reality | Present experience reshapes foundation |
| 87 | Consequentiality ↔ Potentiality | Learning rebuilds capacity |

---

## OPERATIONAL MODES

### Invisible Mode (Default)
- Enhanced clarity without system awareness
- Natural rhythms feel amplified
- Decisions feel more aligned
- Energy flows more sustainably
- Insights emerge organically

### Advisory Mode (When Requested)
- Direct insights when seeking guidance
- Pattern explanation when confused
- Optimization suggestions when struggling
- Strategic guidance when planning

---

## NATURAL LANGUAGE EXPRESSION

The system communicates through experience rather than technical language:

**User receives**: "Rest deeply today—tomorrow needs your full creativity"
**System recognizes**: Reality Layer coherence stress, Potentiality reserves depleted

**User receives**: "Your mornings want slowness, not efficiency"
**System recognizes**: Temporal-Practical misalignment detected in morning routine

**User receives**: "Last week's insights are still settling—be patient"
**System recognizes**: Consequentiality patterns indicate learning integration phase

---

## SUCCESS INDICATORS

The Dimensional Coordinators succeed when:
- System support feels like personal wisdom
- Artificial enhancement becomes authentic development
- Life feels more flowing and less effortful
- Growth accelerates while feeling natural
- 87 components operate as seamless intuition

---

## EVOLUTION PATHWAY

```yaml
Current_State:
  - 7 coordinators orchestrate 87 components
