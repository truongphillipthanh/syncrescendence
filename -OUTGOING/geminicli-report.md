✦ Mission accomplished. The full-spectrum sensing sweep is complete.

  The following reports have been generated and deposited in the
  `-OUTGOING/20260119-sensing_sweep/` export capsule:

   1. `sensing_report.md`: Synthesizes current state, architectural
      tiers, and topology comparison.
   2. `drift_map.md`: Quantifies specific drift items:
       * 49 legacy outgoing/ or OUTGOING/ textual references.
       * 25 stale config/coordination references (file moved to
         02-OPERATIONAL).
       * ~12 legacy ===AUDIZABLE=== markers.
       * 0 __MACOSX artifacts (clean).
   3. `duplication_clusters.md`: Identifies redundancy in lens
      definitions (18_lenses.md vs REF-STANDARDS.md) and survey
      baselines.
   4. `core_candidates.md`: Proposes a 7-file Cognitive Core Nucleus:
       * COCKPIT.md (Operational Entry)
       * CLAUDE.md (Constitutional Protocol)
       * REF-STANDARDS.md (The 18 Lenses)
       * DYN-TREE.md (Structural Blueprint)
       * CANON-00015-MACROSCOPIC_NARRATIVES (Philosophical/Narrative
         Lenses 19-30)
       * TOPOLOGY_MAP.md (Real-time State)
       * Makefile (Execution Engine)
   5. `manifest.json`: Metadata for this sweep pass.

  This package provides the ground truth required for the next phase
  of compression or refactoring.
