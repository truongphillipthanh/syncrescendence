# Sensing Sweep Report: Syncrescendence
**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Status**: Synthesis of Current State

## Executive Summary
The repository is in a state of transition from a legacy flat structure to a tiered, numbered orchestration model. While the core standards (18 Lenses) are well-defined in `00-ORCHESTRATION`, there is significant 'shadow' topology in the `-OUTGOING` and `-INBOX` directories that has not yet been fully canonized.

## State Synthesis
- **Orchestration**: Strong. `REF-STANDARDS.md` provides a clear constitutional framework.
- **Canon**: Expanding. `CANON-00015` introduces macroscopic narratives that bridge technical and philosophical domains.
- **Operational**: Active. The presence of a `Makefile` and `COCKPIT.md` suggests a functional execution layer.

## Topology Comparison
- **Baseline (DYN-TREE.md)**: Expects a clean 00-06 hierarchy.
- **Current (TOPOLOGY_MAP.md)**: Shows 'drift' in the form of temporary folders (`.tmp.drivedownload`) and legacy casing in path references.
