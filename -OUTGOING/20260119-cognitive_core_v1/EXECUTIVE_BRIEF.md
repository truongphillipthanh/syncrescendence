# Cognitive Core v1 — Executive Brief
**Date**: 2026-01-19

## Purpose
Create a minimal, high-truth-density nucleus: interface contract + evaluation governors + retention doctrine + decision atom schema.

## Inputs used
- `CLAUDE.md` (constitution)
- `COCKPIT.md` (entrypoints)
- `00-ORCHESTRATION/state/REF-STANDARDS.md` (18 lenses)
- `01-CANON/CANON-00015-MACROSCOPIC_NARRATIVES-cosmos.md` (narrative lenses)
- `02-OPERATIONAL/coordination.yaml` (model routing)
- Lane A sensing outputs: `-OUTGOING/20260119-sensing_sweep/*` and `-OUTGOING/20260119-corpus_survey/CORE_CANDIDATES.md`

## Outputs created
- `00-ORCHESTRATION/cognitive_core.md`
- `00-ORCHESTRATION/decision_atoms.md`
- `00-ORCHESTRATION/lens_governance.md`
- `00-ORCHESTRATION/model_orchestration.md`

## Intentional exclusions (and why)
- **Full lens definitions**: already canonical in `00-ORCHESTRATION/state/REF-STANDARDS.md`; nucleus only points.
- **Complete narrative lens catalog**: already in `01-CANON/CANON-00015-MACROSCOPIC_NARRATIVES-cosmos.md`; nucleus only maps 19-30 and points.
- **Operational protocols and scripts**: live in `00-ORCHESTRATION/state/` and `00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/`; excluded to keep nucleus small.
- **Model profiles and prompt bodies**: retained in `02-OPERATIONAL/`; nucleus only defines topology.

## Placement note
The nucleus is stored as flat files in `00-ORCHESTRATION/` to respect the flat-directory constraint in `CLAUDE.md`. If a dedicated `00-ORCHESTRATION/core/` folder is later sanctioned, these files can be moved without content changes.
