# Entrypoint Recommendation

## Primary Entrypoint for Defrag Execution (when approved)
- outgoing/DEFRAG_CONVICTION_PASS_20260117_1609/04_defrag_plan/defrag_plan.md
  - Rationale: canonical ordered operations and blockers list.

## Governance Entrypoint (before any apply)
- outgoing/TELEOLOGY_PASS_4_20260117_1430/02_CONCIERGE_COCKPIT_CONSTITUTION.md
  - Rationale: objective lock and closure gate requirements for high-stakes operations.

## Packet/Receipt Entrypoint (for apply audit trail)
- 00-ORCHESTRATION/schemas/packet_protocol.json
  - Rationale: align defrag apply receipts with protocol schema.

## Supporting Context
- outgoing/TELEOLOGY_RING7_PASS_3_20260116_2330/04_PACKETS_AND_PROTOCOLS_V2.md
- outgoing/RING7_PHASESHIFT_PASS_20260116_2219/EXECUTION_PROTOCOL_RING7.md
