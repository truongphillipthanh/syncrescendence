1. Conduct a thorough and complete survey of every artifact (located within the Claude's Projects Files) as metacognition. This step does not need output tokens.
2. Identify all artifacts needed to be reproduced (annealed) according to system prompt, calibrated to the most recent annealment guidelines (also located in Project Files) that can be completed in a single thread because of length limits as a concise high level schema.
3. Produce those updated canonical artifacts in order, and produce as artifacts. DUE TO LENGTH LIMITS PRODUCE THIS STEP AS ARTIFACTS.
4. Culminate IN-LINE with a report of progress, and a next batch outline, as context engineering.
