## QUICK DIMENSION REMINDERS

**When uncertain which dimension applies:**

1. **Cosmological sophistication?** → Scale: [1-4]-[Name]
2. **Chain competence?** → Level: [1-4]-[Name] [Chain]
3. **Lunar mastery (5 levels)?** → Degree: [1-5]-[Name]
4. **Platform maturity?** → Stage: [1-5]-[Name]
5. **Business timeline?** → Phase: [Name] Phase

**Orthogonality principle**: Any combination is valid unless violating internal constraints (Level requires previous Level mastery, Degree requires previous Degree mastery, Stage/Phase sequential).

**Master Schema is your north star.** When in doubt, consult it before proceeding.
