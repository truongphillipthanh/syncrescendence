# MASTER TERMINOLOGY SCHEMA v1.0: Locked Canonical Reference

**Status**: LOCKED & AUTHORITATIVE  
**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Authority**: Single point of truth for entire Syncrescendence corpus  
**Principle**: Five non-overlapping dimensions, named scales as primary, numbers secondary  
**Version Stability**: Do not modify without explicit decision

---

## THE FIVE DIMENSIONS (AUTHORITATIVE)

### DIMENSION 1: SCALE
**Purpose**: Practitioner cosmological sophistication (optional advancement)  
**Primary Label**: Scale  
**Numbered Secondary**: 1-4  
**Use**: Describe how much cosmological framework practitioner engages with

```
Scale: 1-Micro
├─ Definition: Seven Pulses only, no cosmology
├─ Cosmological Framework: None
├─ Entry Point: Universal (anyone can begin)
├─ Time to Attain: Immediate
└─ Example: "I'm practicing at Scale: 1-Micro"

Scale: 2-Meso  
├─ Definition: Air/Water/Fire/Earth elemental framing
├─ Cosmological Framework: Elemental correspondence, seasonal cycles
├─ Time to Attain: 1-3 months engagement
└─ Example: "I'm exploring Scale: 2-Meso practices"

Scale: 3-Macro
├─ Definition: Full planetary mechanics and cosmological architecture
├─ Cosmological Framework: Complete six planets, all systems integrated
├─ Time to Attain: 3-12 months engagement
└─ Example: "I practice at Scale: 3-Macro"

Scale: 4-Meta
├─ Definition: Avatar manifestations, mythological depth, civilizations
├─ Cosmological Framework: Maximum symbolic integration, archetypal sophistication
├─ Time to Attain: 1-3 years engagement
└─ Example: "I'm working with Scale: 4-Meta frameworks"
```

**Key Principle**: 
- Advancement is **optional** (not required)
- Practitioners can remain at any Scale indefinitely with full benefit
- Scale: 1-Micro is perfectly sufficient for complete practice
- No superiority hierarchy (Meta ≠ better than Micro)

---

### DIMENSION 2: LEVEL
**Purpose**: Chain development progression (competence within specific chains)  
**Primary Label**: Level  
**Numbered Secondary**: 1-4  
**Application**: Six chains (Technology, Sensing, Coherence, Efficacy, Embodiment, Transcendence)  
**Use**: Describe advancement in specific developmental domain

```
Level: 1-Initial
├─ Duration Typical: 3-6 months focused practice
├─ Characteristic: Basic literacy, pattern recognition, foundational concepts
├─ Evidence of Attainment: Can identify and describe core concepts reliably
├─ Advancement Gate: Demonstrated competence (not just exposure)
├─ Teaching Capacity: None yet (still learning)
└─ Example: "I'm at Level: 1-Initial in the Coherence Chain"

Level: 2-Intermediate
├─ Duration Typical: 6-12 months intensive engagement
├─ Characteristic: Sophistication increase, tool mastery, consistent application
├─ Evidence of Attainment: Can deploy knowledge strategically, measurable results
├─ Advancement Gate: Reliable capability demonstrated repeatedly
├─ Teaching Capacity: Limited teaching (beginners only, supervised)
└─ Example: "I've reached Level: 2-Intermediate in Technology Chain"

Level: 3-Advanced
├─ Duration Typical: 1-3 years sustained practice
├─ Characteristic: Meta-cognitive awareness, intuitive use, adaptive application
├─ Evidence of Attainment: Automatic competence, can handle novel situations
├─ Advancement Gate: Successfully teaching others complex concepts
├─ Teaching Capacity: Full teaching capacity (any student, unsupervised)
└─ Example: "I'm operating at Level: 3-Advanced in Efficacy Chain"

Level: 4-Mastery
├─ Duration Typical: 3-10+ years embodied wisdom
├─ Characteristic: Framework transcendence, lived integration, wisdom transmission
├─ Evidence of Attainment: Second-generation students developing through you
├─ Advancement Gate: Your students teaching successfully at Level: 3-Advanced
├─ Teaching Capacity: Teaching teachers, framework evolution capacity
└─ Example: "I've attained Level: 4-Mastery in Embodiment Chain"
```

**Key Principles**:
- Advancement **requires demonstrated competence** at previous Level
- Practitioners can be **different Levels in different chains** (e.g., Level: 2-Intermediate in Technology, Level: 3-Advanced in Coherence)
- No universal prerequisite (can start Efficacy while Technology still at Level: 1-Initial, with compensation)
- Teaching capacity **increases with Level advancement**

---

### DIMENSION 3: DEGREE

- Founder progression through Phases ≠ student progression through Levels
- All dimensions evolving **simultaneously across all Phases**

---

## ORTHOGONALITY PRINCIPLE (DEFINITIVE)

These five dimensions are **COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT**. Any valid combination:

### Valid Combinations (All Possible)

```
Scale: 1-Micro, Level: 4-Mastery, Degree: 3-Commitment, Stage: 4-Atrium, Phase: Scaling
→ Elemental practitioner teaching advanced chain work to YouTube audience while business scales

Scale: 4-Meta, Level: 1-Initial, Degree: 5-Transmission, Stage: 1-Forum, Phase: Foundation
→ Mythological practitioner beginning chain development while transmitting Lunar wisdom via newsletter in early business

Scale: 2-Meso, Level: 2-Intermediate, Degree: 2-Exploration, Stage: 3-Amphitheatre, Phase: Institute
→ Elemental practitioner, developing intermediate competence, exploring Lunar integration, writing long-form, during institutional development

Scale: 3-Macro, Level: 3-Advanced, Degree: 4-Integration, Stage: 2-Podium, Stage: 5-Portico, Phase: Scaling
→ Complete practitioner, advanced chains, integrated Lunar, tweeting and publishing simultaneously, during scaling phase

Scale: 1-Micro, Level: 4-Mastery, Degree: 1-Recognition, Stage: 1-Forum, Phase: Foundation
→ Functional practitioner, chain mastery, recognizing Lunar systems newly, newsletter only, early stage
```

### Impossible Constraints (Do Not Enforce)

```
✗ "Must reach Scale: 3-Macro before Level: 2-Intermediate" ← WRONG
✗ "Can only reach Degree: 4-Integration if all Levels at 3-Advanced" ← WRONG  
✗ "Stage: 5-Portico requires Degree: 5-Transmission" ← WRONG
✗ "Can't start Stage: 4-Atrium until Phase: Scaling" ← WRONG
✗ "Scale advancement gates Level advancement" ← WRONG
✗ "Degree progression follows Stage progression" ← WRONG
```

## DIMENSION INDEPENDENCE MATRIX

| **Scale** | **Level** | **Degree** | **Stage** | **Phase** | **Valid?** |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Any | Any | Any | Any | Any | ✓ YES |
| 1-Micro | 4-Mastery | 5-Trans | 5-Portico | Institute | ✓ YES |
| 4-Meta | 1-Initial | 1-Recog | 1-Forum | Foundation | ✓ YES |
| 2-Meso | 3-Advanced | 2-Expl | 3-Amphitheatre | Scaling | ✓ YES |
| *[any combo]* | *[any]* | *[any]* | *[any]* | *[any]* | ✓ YES |

**Rule**: Any combination of Scale, Level, Degree, Stage, and Phase is valid **unless** internal dimension constraints violated:
- Level advancement: requires previous Level mastery
- Degree advancement: requires previous Degree mastery
- Stage sequencing: Forum → Podium → Amphitheatre → Atrium → Portico (organizational gating)
- Phase sequencing: Foundation → Validation → Scaling → Institute → Infrastructure (time ordering)
- Scale selection: free choice, no ordering

## MASTER GLOSSARY: QUICK REFERENCE

### Terminology Eliminated (Effective Immediately)
- ~~"Tier"~~ → Use "Scale" (practitioner), "Stage" (platform), or "Level" (chain)
- ~~"Mastery Level"~~ → Use "Degree" (Lunar) or "Level: 4-Mastery" (chain)
- ~~"Phase of development"~~ → Use "Level" or "Degree"

### Terminology Standardized (Effective Immediately)
- **Scale: [Number]-[Name]** → Scale: 1-Micro, 2-Meso, 3-Macro, 4-Meta
- **Level: [Number]-[Name]** → Level: 1-Initial, 2-Intermediate, 3-Advanced, 4-Mastery
- **Degree: [Number]-[Name]** → Degree: 1-Recognition through 5-Transmission
- **Stage: [Number]-[Name]** → Stage: 1-Forum, 2-Podium, 3-Amphitheatre, 4-Atrium, 5-Portico
- **Phase: [Name] Phase** → Foundation, Validation, Scaling, Institute, Infrastructure

### Usage Examples (Model These)

**Correct**:
- "I'm practicing at Scale: 2-Meso and Level: 3-Advanced in Technology Chain"
- "We're launching Stage: 2-Podium content while in Phase: Foundation"
- "She's reached Degree: 4-Integration of Lunar Systems"
- "Level: 1-Initial in Efficacy Chain is prerequisite for Level: 2-Intermediate"

**Incorrect** (Never Use):
- "I'm at Tier 3" ← Ambiguous, use "Scale: 3-Macro" or "Level: 3-Advanced"
- "Practice Level with five mastery levels" ← Confused dimensions
- "We're in the development phase" ← Vague, use "Phase: Scaling" or "Level: 2-Intermediate"
- "Advanced tier practitioners" ← Use "Advanced Level practitioners" or "Scale: 3-Macro"

---

## IMPLEMENTATION RULES

### When Writing About Scale
Always format: **Scale: [1-4]-[Name]** with name as primary label  
Example: "Scale: 3-Macro practitioners engage full cosmology"

### When Writing About Level
Always format: **Level: [1-4]-[Name]** specifying chain when relevant  
Example: "She's at Level: 2-Intermediate in the Sensing Chain"

### When Writing About Degree  
Always format: **Degree: [1-5]-[Name]**  
Example: "Students reaching Degree: 3-Commitment show transformation"

### When Writing About Stage
Always format: **Stage: [1-5]-[Name]** or **Stage: [Name]** interchangeably  
Example: "Stage: 3-Amphitheatre content drives deeper engagement"

### When Writing About Phase
Always format: **Phase: [Name] Phase** explicitly  
Example: "During Phase: Scaling, we expect 20-50 students annually"
