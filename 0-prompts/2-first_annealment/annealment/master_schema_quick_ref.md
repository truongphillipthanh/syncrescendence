## THE FIVE DIMENSIONS AT A GLANCE

| Dimension | Primary Label | Range | Names | Purpose | Context |
|-----------|---------------|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| **Scale** | Scale: [1-4]-[Name] | 1-4 | Micro, Meso, Macro, Meta | Practitioner cosmological sophistication | Optional advancement, no hierarchy |
| **Level** | Level: [1-4]-[Name] [Chain] | 1-4 | Initial, Intermediate, Advanced, Mastery | Chain development progression | Specific to 6 chains; requires previous mastery |
| **Degree** | Degree: [1-5]-[Name] | 1-5 | Recognition, Exploration, Commitment, Integration, Transmission | Lunar mastery (Coherence/Transcendence) | Orthogonal from all others; requires previous mastery |
| **Stage** | Stage: [1-5]-[Name] | 1-5 | Forum, Podium, Amphitheatre, Atrium, Portico | Content production platform maturity | Organizational gating; sequential prerequisites |
| **Phase** | Phase: [Name] Phase | — | Foundation, Validation, Scaling, Institute, Infrastructure | Business operational timeline | Chronological; not practitioner progression |

## DIMENSION 1: SCALE
**What It Measures**: Practitioner cosmological sophistication  
**Primary Label**: Scale: [1-4]-[Name]  
**Key Principle**: Optional advancement, no superiority hierarchy

```
Scale: 1-Micro
  → Seven Pulses only, no cosmology
  → Entry point: Universal (anyone can begin)
  → "I'm practicing at Scale: 1-Micro"

Scale: 2-Meso
  → Air/Water/Fire/Earth elemental framing
  → Time to attain: 1-3 months engagement
  → "I'm exploring Scale: 2-Meso practices"

Scale: 3-Macro
  → Full planetary mechanics, complete cosmological architecture
  → Time to attain: 3-12 months engagement
  → "I practice at Scale: 3-Macro"

Scale: 4-Meta
  → Avatar manifestations, mythological depth, civilizations
  → Time to attain: 1-3 years engagement
  → "I'm working with Scale: 4-Meta frameworks"
```

**Critical Rule**: 
- Scale: 1-Micro practitioners have FULL BENEFIT
- Advancement is OPTIONAL (not required)
- No "better than" hierarchy—just different complexity levels

---

## DIMENSION 2: LEVEL
**What It Measures**: Chain development progression (competence within specific developmental domain)  
**Primary Label**: Level: [1-4]-[Name] [Chain Name]  
**Key Principle**: Always specify which chain; advancement requires demonstrated mastery of previous level

```
The Six Chains: Technology, Sensing, Coherence, Efficacy, Embodiment, Transcendence

Level: 1-Initial
  → 3-6 months typical focused practice per chain
  → Basic literacy, pattern recognition, foundation building
  → "She's at Level: 1-Initial in Sensing Chain"

Level: 2-Intermediate
  → 6-12 months typical practice per chain
  → Applied competence, teaching emerging capability
  → "He's at Level: 2-Intermediate in Technology Chain"

Level: 3-Advanced
  → 1-3 years typical practice per chain
  → Mastered fundamentals, synthetic application, integration beginning
  → "They're at Level: 3-Advanced in Efficacy Chain"

Level: 4-Mastery
  → 3-10+ years typical practice per chain
  → Teaching authoritatively, modifying frameworks, civilization-scale contribution
  → "She's reached Level: 4-Mastery in Embodiment Chain"
```

**Critical Rules**:
- ALWAYS specify the chain (never just "Level: 2")
- Use format: "Level: [1-4]-[Name] in [Chain Name]"
- Advancement requires demonstrated previous level competence
- Each chain is independent (can be Level: 1-Initial in one, Level: 4-Mastery in another)

---

## DIMENSION 3: DEGREE
**What It Measures**: Lunar mastery progression (Coherence & Transcendence systems specifically)  
**Primary Label**: Degree: [1-5]-[Name]  
**Key Principle**: Orthogonal from all other dimensions; Lunar-specific; advancement requires previous degree mastery

```
Degree: 1-Recognition
  → Initial awareness of Lunar system
  → Understanding that system exists and its basic structure
  → "She's at Degree: 1-Recognition of Transcendence"

Degree: 2-Exploration
  → Active experimentation and engagement
  → Testing frameworks, discovering personal patterns
  → "He's moving through Degree: 2-Exploration of Coherence"

Degree: 3-Commitment
  → Committed daily/regular practice
  → Integration into life structure
  → "They've reached Degree: 3-Commitment in Lunar systems"

Degree: 4-Integration
  → System fully integrated into life
  → Teaching capability emerging
  → "She's at Degree: 4-Integration of Coherence"

Degree: 5-Transmission
  → Teaching authoritatively, transmitting lineage
  → Modification and innovation, civilization-scale contribution
  → "He's reached Degree: 5-Transmission of both systems"
```

**Critical Rules**:
- Degree: applies ONLY to Lunar systems (Coherence + Transcendence)
- Can be Degree: [1-5] while at Scale: 1-Micro (independent)
- Can be Degree: [1-5] while Level: 1-Initial (independent)
- Advancement requires demonstrated previous Degree mastery
- Same five levels for both Coherence and Transcendence (parallel structure)

## DIMENSION 4: STAGE
**What It Measures**: Content production platform maturity (organizational capability)  
**Primary Label**: Stage: [1-5]-[Name]  
**Key Principle**: Sequential organizational gating; prerequisites exist; reflects production capability

```
Stage: 1-Forum
  → Newsletter (direct email communication)
  → Weekly synthesis content (1000-1500 words)
  → Direct subscriber base, intimate personal communication
  → Prerequisites: None (can start immediately)
  → "We're launching Stage: 1-Forum content"

Stage: 2-Podium
  → X/Twitter (compressed messaging platform)
  → Compressed sparks (280-character precision thinking)
  → Attention-driven discovery, rapid iteration
  → Prerequisites: Stage: 1-Forum established
  → "Stage: 2-Podium deployment validates core message"

Stage: 3-Amphitheatre
  → Medium/Substack (expandable long-form platform)
  → Expandable arguments (3000-8000 words depth)
  → Deep readers, substantive engagement
  → Prerequisites: Stage: 2-Podium established
  → "Stage: 3-Amphitheatre pieces deepen argument"

Stage: 4-Atrium
  → YouTube (cinematic visual demonstration)
  → Cinematic demonstrations (10-30 minute videos)
  → Visual learners, production sophistication
  → Prerequisites: Stage: 3-Amphitheatre established
  → "Stage: 4-Atrium enables broader reach"

Stage: 5-Portico
  → Book/Live Events (enduring artifacts)
  → Comprehensive bound works and live experience
  → Permanent record, civilization-scale contribution
  → Prerequisites: Stage: 4-Atrium established
  → "Stage: 5-Portico represents full institutional maturity"
```

**Critical Rules**:
- Sequential gating: Forum → Podium → Amphitheatre → Atrium → Portico (in order)
- Stage describes PLATFORM MATURITY, not practitioner sophistication
- Can be Stage: 1-Forum while Scale: 4-Meta (independent)
- Can be Stage: 5-Portico while Level: 1-Initial (independent)
- Organizational prerequisites exist (must complete each stage before next)

## DIMENSION 5: PHASE
**What It Measures**: Business operational timeline  
**Primary Label**: Phase: [Name] Phase  
**Key Principle**: Chronological business timeline; orthogonal from all other dimensions

```
Phase: Foundation Phase
  → Early exploration, system design, proof of concept
  → Building infrastructure, discovering what works
  → "We're in Phase: Foundation Phase"

Phase: Validation Phase
  → Testing framework with first practitioners
  → Gathering evidence, refining approach
  → "We're completing Phase: Validation Phase"

Phase: Scaling Phase
  → Expanding practitioner base, 20-50 students annually
  → Replication and systematization
  → "We're entering Phase: Scaling Phase"

Phase: Institute Phase
  → Institutional establishment, 100+ practitioners
  → Teaching infrastructure, community formation
  → "We've begun Phase: Institute Phase"

Phase: Infrastructure Phase
  → Civilization-scale infrastructure, enduring institutions
  → Multi-decade trajectory
  → "We're investing in Phase: Infrastructure Phase"
```

**Critical Rules**:
- Phase describes BUSINESS TIMELINE, NOT practitioner development
- Sequential chronological ordering: Foundation → Validation → Scaling → Institute → Infrastructure
- Can be Phase: Scaling while at Scale: 1-Micro (independent)
- Never confuse Phase with Level or Degree (completely different dimensions)
- "Phase of practice" or "practice phase" is WRONG—use Level or Degree

## ORTHOGONALITY MATRIX: VALID & IMPOSSIBLE COMBINATIONS

### ✓ VALID COMBINATIONS (All Possible)

```
Scale: 1-Micro, Level: 4-Mastery, Degree: 3-Commitment, Stage: 4-Atrium, Phase: Scaling
→ Elemental practitioner teaching advanced chains to YouTube audience while business scales

Scale: 4-Meta, Level: 1-Initial, Degree: 5-Transmission, Stage: 1-Forum, Phase: Foundation
→ Mythological practitioner beginning chains while transmitting Lunar wisdom via newsletter

Scale: 2-Meso, Level: 2-Intermediate, Degree: 2-Exploration, Stage: 3-Amphitheatre, Phase: Institute
→ Elemental practitioner, intermediate competence, exploring Lunar, writing long-form essays

ANY COMBINATION IS VALID UNLESS VIOLATING INTERNAL CONSTRAINTS (see below)
```

### ✗ IMPOSSIBLE CONSTRAINTS (Never Enforce)

```
✗ "Must reach Scale: 3-Macro before Level: 2-Intermediate"
  → WRONG: Scale and Level are independent

✗ "Can only reach Degree: 4-Integration if all Levels at 3-Advanced"
  → WRONG: Degree and Level are independent

✗ "Stage: 5-Portico requires Degree: 5-Transmission"
  → WRONG: Stage and Degree are independent

✗ "Can't start Stage: 4-Atrium until Phase: Scaling"
  → WRONG: Stage and Phase are independent

✗ "Scale advancement gates Level advancement"
  → WRONG: Each dimension advances independently

✗ "Degree progression follows Stage progression"
  → WRONG: Completely orthogonal systems
```

### ✓ REAL CONSTRAINTS (Enforce These)

```
✓ Level: 2-Intermediate requires demonstrated Level: 1-Initial mastery
  → Advancement within Level dimension has ordering

✓ Degree: 3-Commitment requires demonstrated Degree: 1-Recognition AND Degree: 2-Exploration mastery
  → Advancement within Degree dimension has ordering

✓ Stage: 3-Amphitheatre requires Stage: 1-Forum AND Stage: 2-Podium first
  → Stage sequencing is organizational gating (must complete previous stages)

✓ Phase: Scaling comes after Phase: Foundation and Phase: Validation
  → Phase sequencing is chronological business timeline

✓ Scale selection is free (no ordering)
  → Practitioners can choose any Scale and remain there indefinitely
```

## TERMINOLOGY STANDARDIZATION: WHAT TO REPLACE

### Find & Replace Mapping

```
OLD TERMINOLOGY               → NEW TERMINOLOGY
"Tier"                        → Scale/Level/Stage/Degree (context-dependent)
"Content Tier"                → Stage: [1-5]-[Name]
"Practice Tier"               → Scale: [1-4]-[Name]
"Mastery Level" (5-level)     → Degree: [1-5]-[Name]
"Mastery Level" (4-level)     → Level: 4-Mastery [Chain]
"Level" (in Lunar context)    → Degree: [1-5]-[Name]
"Level" (ambiguous)           → Level: [1-4]-[Name] [Chain] (add chain context)
"Stage" (chain progression)   → Level: [1-4]-[Name] [Chain]
"Phase" (practitioner dev)    → Level or Degree (not Phase)
"Development phase"           → Level: [1-4] or Degree: [1-5] (not Phase)
"Advanced tier"               → Scale: 3-Macro / Level: 3-Advanced / Degree: 4-Integration (context)
```

### Correct Usage Examples

✓ "She's at Scale: 2-Meso and Level: 3-Advanced in Technology Chain"  
✓ "He's reached Degree: 4-Integration of Coherence while in Stage: 2-Podium"  
✓ "We're launching Stage: 2-Podium during Phase: Foundation Phase"  
✓ "Level: 1-Initial Efficacy practitioners begin with Core Competencies"  
✓ "Scale: 1-Micro provides complete sufficiency for transformation"

### Incorrect Usage Examples (Fix If Found)

✗ "I'm at Tier 3" (ambiguous which dimension)  
✗ "Five mastery levels of practice" (confuses dimensions)  
✗ "Advanced phase of development" (Phase ≠ development)  
✗ "Must reach Tier 2 before starting Tier 3" (no hierarchy between dimensions)  
✗ "Stage 2 requires Scale 3" (dimensions independent)

## ANTI-PATTERNS: COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Mistake 1: Blind Find-Replace
```
✗ Replace all "Level" → "Level: [1-4]" without checking context
✓ Verify each instance—is it Degree, Level, Stage, or Scale?
```

### Mistake 2: Incomplete Chain Context
```
✗ "Level: 2" (which chain?)
✓ "Level: 2-Intermediate in Sensing Chain"
```

### Mistake 3: Dimensional Contamination
```
✗ "Must reach Scale: 3 before Level: 2"
✓ Each dimension independent; no ordering between them
```

### Mistake 4: Confusing Phase with Progression
```
✗ "She's in the advanced phase of practice"
✓ "She's at Level: 3-Advanced in Technology Chain"
```

### Mistake 5: Mixing Orthogonal Dimensions
```
✗ "Stage: 5-Portico requires Degree: 5-Transmission"
✓ Stage and Degree are independent; any combination valid
```
