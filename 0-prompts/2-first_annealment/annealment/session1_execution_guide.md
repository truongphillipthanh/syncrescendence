## TIER 1: FOUNDATION ARTIFACTS

### Document 1.1: CANON-00006-SYNCRESCENDENT_OPERATIONS_V2_1.md

**Impact Level**: HIGH  
**Estimated References**: ~80  
**Status**: Mostly v2.1 clean, mixed terminology exists  
**Time Estimate**: 25-30 minutes

#### Find-Replace Operations (in sequence):

**OPERATION 1: Preserve Correct Terminology**
```
Search: "Practice Level"
Action: LEAVE UNCHANGED (already correct)
Rationale: Already standardized in v2.1
Estimated Count: ~5 instances
```

**OPERATION 2: Platform Maturity Standardization**
```
Search: "Content Tier"
Replace With: "Stage: [N]-[Name]" where:
  • Tier 0 → Stage: 1-Forum
  • Tier 1 → Stage: 2-Podium
  • Tier 2 → Stage: 3-Amphitheatre
  • Tier 3 → Stage: 4-Atrium
  • Tier 4 → Stage: 5-Portico

Verification: Confirm context is PLATFORM/CONTENT, not chain progression
Estimated Count: ~20 replacements
```

**OPERATION 3: Lunar Progression Terminology**
```
Search: "Mastery Levels" (5-level systems)
Replace With: "Degree: [1-5]-[Name]"
Mapping: Recognition, Exploration, Commitment, Integration, Transmission
Verification: Only for Coherence/Transcendence chains (Lunar contexts)
Estimated Count: ~8 replacements
```

**OPERATION 4: Chain Progression Clarification**
```
Search: "Stage" (when referring to chain development)
Replace With: "Level: [1-4]-[Name]"
Mapping: Initial, Intermediate, Advanced, Mastery
Verification: Each instance—confirm it's about chain, NOT platform maturity
Estimated Count: ~15 replacements
```

**OPERATION 5: Generic Tier Removal**
```
Search: "Tier" (standalone, ambiguous usage)
Action: Context-dependent replacement:
  • Practitioner sophistication → "Scale: [1-4]-[Name]"
  • Platform → "Stage: [1-5]-[Name]"
  • Chain progression → "Level: [1-4]-[Name]"
Verification: NEVER blind replace—verify each context
Estimated Count: ~10 replacements
```

**OPERATION 6: Numeric References Without Chain**
```
Search: "Level [1-3]" (ambiguous numeric reference)
Check: Does it specify a chain? (e.g., "Level 2 in Technology")
  • If YES: Keep and add chain context if missing
  • If NO: Determine appropriate dimension from context
Estimated Count: ~5 spot-checks
```

**Validation Checklist (After Doc 1.1)**:
- [ ] All "Stage:" references include theatrical names (Forum, Podium, etc.)
- [ ] Zero remaining "Content Tier" or ambiguous "Tier"
- [ ] "Practice Level" preserved as-is
- [ ] "Degree:" used only for Lunar (Coherence/Transcendence)
- [ ] Document reads cohesively with no dimensional confusion

```
Search: "Phase" (if referring to practitioner development)
Action: ONLY replace if it's practitioner progression, NOT business timeline
Replace With: "Level: [1-4]-[Chain]" or "Degree: [1-5]" (verify Lunar vs chain)
Note: Phases (Foundation, Validation, Scaling, etc.) = business timeline—leave those alone
Estimated Count: ~3-5 replacements
```

**OPERATION 4: Chain Progression in Strategy**
```
Search: "Stage" (if referring to chain development)
Replace With: "Level: [1-4]-[Name]"
Verification: Check each instance—confirm it's about chain, not platform

```

**OPERATION 5: Generic Tier Removal**
```
Search: "Tier" (standalone)

**OPERATION 6: Orthogonality Verification**
```
Before finalizing: Scan for dimensional mixing statements
Flag if found: "Must reach Scale 3 before Level 2" ✗

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO PREVENT

**Pattern 1: Blind Find-Replace**
- ✗ Replace all "Level" → "Level: [1-4]"
- ✓ Verify each "Level" context before replacing

**Pattern 2: Incomplete Chain Context**
- ✗ "Level: 2" (ambiguous which chain?)
- ✓ "Level: 2-Intermediate in Technology Chain"

**Pattern 3: Dimensional Contamination**
- ✗ "Must reach Scale 3 before Level 2"
- ✓ Each dimension independent (no ordering between them)

**Pattern 4: Losing Orthogonality**
- ✗ Implying dimensional hierarchy or dependencies
- ✓ Maintaining that all valid combinations are possible
