Now that we have successfully established the core Lunar Systems that were much more astrologically entangled/synchronicitous, we can focus on the lunar systems that are much more primordial and timeless. These being the lunar systems of Coherence and Transcendence.

As previously mentioned, Coherence represents the crux, the Epistemic Core the Hermeneutical engine. These in plain English are the generative mental models, frameworks, and systems. This currently is the most fractal as these lunar dust contain both nascent and mature components. What currently exists is essentially a sandbox of inception, intelligence, and emergence. The lunar system that must arise from these lunar dust must be a way to systematically engender and formulate coherent mental models and frameworks and systems. What currently exists are six potential entities that might coalesce into lunar objects. Perhaps they coalesce/consolidate. Perhaps they divide and replicate.
1. The first accretion are the artifacts prefix labeled with a [Coherence_Lunar_Arifacts-] prefix label. These represent primordial kernel, the rudimentary steam engine before we had the nuclear fusion of the Syncrescendence.
2. The second are the artifacts prefix labeled with a [Coherence_Lunar_CognitivePalace - ] prefix label. These of course were the canonical operational artifacts of the Syncrescendent Cognitive Palace, needing simple annealment.
3. The third are the artifacts prefix labeled with a [Coherence_Lunar_Knowledge] prefix label. These are the artifacts that represent the Epistemological Morphology Lens/Perspective to appropriately comprehend/understand/fully Grok any concept.
4. The fourth are the artifacts prefix labeled with a [Coherence_Lunar_Meaning] prefix label. These are the artifacts that represent the Semantic Morphology Lens/Perspective to appropriately interpret any concept.
5. The fourth are the artifacts prefix labeled with a [Coherence_Lunar_Metahumanism] prefix label. These are the artifacts that represent the foundational research that formalized the Syncrescendent encapsulation.
6. The fifth is the [Coherence_Lunar_Ontological Container]. This artifact represents the atomizing/essentializing Lens/Perspective. It was the seed that gave birth to the Cognitive Palace.
The primitives of these assets are unique because they are more eternal. The voluminous, massive, fractal complexity become a feature, not a bug. The timelessness means that they are not AS subject to the Synchroncity, rather the other Cosmological artifacts synchronizes to it. This does not mean thet this Lunar static, slowly succumbing to heat death. This is the life-bringing entropy, the eternal source of emergence, so apt as the Water Planet. As the Syncrescendent Core grows and the more we discover about all things, the more we syncretize, adopt, assimilate, and synthesize, the further the Lunar systems evolve/develop, mitose/replicate, and so too does the Cosmology. 

Simultaneously, we have all the research that produced the foundation for the Transcendence Ring and Chain. And here appears about five potential lunar entities: Metaphysical, Monotheist, Nontheist, Identitial, Way of Life/Code of Conduct. These represent Anthropology's ontological humility, currently unresolved, unfalsifiable, sage revelations that provides, and continues to provide confounding salience and prescience, perhaps too imbued in analeptism and anachronism, though persistence and evolution may suggest otherwise. These too are myopic, only touch upon what have hitherto digested. Veritability here may not ever be attained.

1. The first are the artifacts with a [Transcendence_Lunar_Metaphysicalism-] prefix label. This provides a map of a meta/liminal dimension of systems that may be accessed, at the very least provide a narrative scaffold. 
2. The second are the artifacts with a [Transcendence_Lunar_Monotheism-] prefix label. The insurmountable amount of meaning this represents to humanity is ineffable, even to the skeptics. It's the ultimate Cause. It's an anthropological compass, if not requirement (the search for a Higher Being and the desire to Create).
3. The third are the artifacts with a [Transcendence_Lunar_Nontheism-] prefix label. This represents je ne sais quoi, the ineffable sought to be encapsulated, formalized.
4. The fourth are the artifacts with a [Transcendence_Lunar_Identitial-] prefix label. Currently these are my specific qualia and experiential organ, expressed in the colloquialisms of the zeitgeist, nascent still requiring generalization/eternalization and depth.
5. The fourth are the artifacts with a [Transcendence_Lunar_Preceptual-] prefix label. The represent Civilizational compression of virtuous comportment. 
6. The fifth are the artifacts with a [Transcendence_Lunar_Systemic-] prefix label. These were the seminal artifacts that engendered the Transcendence Ring and Chain. They represented a distillation of seasoned, veteran, virtuous-cycling traditions that represents the aspirational, bootstrapping, foundational substrate the Transcendence Components sought to emulate.

These two lunar systems have a special interference pattern because there is an overlapping in the understanding, illumination, insight, wisdom systems that provide the foundational substrates of these Lunar systems, and by proxy the entire Cosmology. As such, this final accretion of lunar artifacts is dependent on the holistic vantage point that can behold these two systems, its heart/soul/spirit/essence, and by proxy, the entirety of the Cosmology.

The first task is a thorough, complete metacognitive survey of every artifact located within the Project Files with a deep hermeneutical infusion to my request. There should be a holistic, recursive cogency and logic exegetical reframing once the context aperture has widened with the survey. The result should be a hypercharged, hyperpotent, comprehensive, meticulous, and rigorous refactoring and substantiation aimed at Omnibenevolence, Omniscience, Omnipotence, and Omnipresence. This will be used to conduct a high level schema for this final lunar endeavor.

Produce as an artifact.
