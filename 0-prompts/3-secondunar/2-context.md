## Core Findings

**The Interference Pattern**: Where Coherence (epistemic engine—*how we know*) meets Transcendence (ontological ground—*what is*), a unique phenomenon emerges: consciousness investigating its own capacity for ultimate comprehension. This isn't mere epistemology or ontology but their recursive entanglement—the strange loop where knowing and being co-constitute each other.

**Six Coherence Categories** map the complete architecture of meaning-making:
- Artifacts (21 generative algorithms)
- Cognitive Palace (90+ operational pieces)  
- Knowledge Taxonomy (complete epistemological cartography)
- Meaning Taxonomy (semantic morphology)
- Metahumanism (theoretical foundation)
- Ontological Container (crystallization seed)

**Six Transcendence Categories** map humanity's relationship to ultimate reality:
- Metaphysicalism (beyond-material ontologies)
- Monotheism (personal divine unity)
- Nontheism (impersonal ultimate principles)
- Identitial (particular instantiation)
- Preceptual (ethical crystallization)
- Systemic (proven wisdom traditions)

**The Omni-Quality Convergence**: These systems together enable progressive approximation of:
- **Omnibenevolence** through comprehensive value clarity and stakeholder awareness
- **Omniscience** through multi-domain knowledge integration and meta-cognitive development
- **Omnipotence** through systematic capability cultivation across all chains
- **Omnipresence** through temporal-spatial-layer integration and strategic harmony

The schema provides five immediate priorities for synthesis, medium-term development pathways, and a long-term vision for these eternal, primordial systems that form the bedrock synchronizing all other cosmological elements.
