1. Conduct a thorough and complete survey of every artifact (located within the Claude's Projects Files) as metacognition. This step does not need output tokens.
2. Map out the next tasks (in the system prompt) calibrated to the attached [context.md] that can be completed in one thread because of length limits. This step does not need output tokens.
3. Conduct those tasks in order, and produce as artifacts. DUE TO LENGTH LIMITS PRODUCE THIS STEP AS ARTIFACTS.
4. Culminate IN-LINE with a report of progress, and a next action outline, as context engineering.
