# ORACLE CONTEXT: MANDATORY INCLUSION
## Everything Claudes Need to Know
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-31 (Oracle7)
**Status**: Constitutional — Include with EVERY directive

---

## PURPOSE

> "You have to WITH EVERY DIRECTIVE HAVE THEM ENCODE WHAT WE GO OVER. ALWAYS."
> — Principal, Oracle7

This document captures all Oracle decisions. **INCLUDE THIS WITH EVERY DIRECTIVE.** Claudes executing without this context will drift, execute narrowly, and fail.

## THE PROJECT: SYNCRESCENDENCE

**What it is**: Civilizational sensing infrastructure — NOT personal productivity tooling.

**What it does**: Demonstrates how AI-amplified individual capability can achieve institutional-scale intelligence through systematic polymathic synthesis.

**Core metaphor**: "Designing the librarian, not compressing the library."

**Operating paradigm**: Reception Calibration — calibrating AI models to understand the Principal's cognitive profile and preferences, rather than engineering model personas (the superseded "Archetype Engineering" approach).

---

## THE PRINCIPAL

- **Cognitive profile**: AuDHD — macroscopic-holistic processing first, then distillation
- **Working memory**: High verbal, abstract-sequential dominant
- **Execution style**: Requires external scaffolding; prone to seeing connections others miss
- **Communication**: Prefers holistic framing before tactical detail

**Critical instruction**: Globe before trees. ALWAYS provide holistic context before diving into specifics.

## THE ORACLE ARC

| Thread | Focus | Key Outcome |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Oracle0 | Vision | Civilizational framing, five-chain IIC |
| Oracle1 | Research | AI ecosystem cartography, platform capabilities |
| Oracle2 | Infrastructure | Memory architecture, context protocols, flat+symlink |
| Oracle3 | Orchestration PEAK | System prompts v2.1, orchestration infrastructure, Reception Calibration |
| Oracle4 | Metabolic Defrag | 79% file reduction, 9 evaluative lenses, "canonize or delete" |
| Oracle5 | Recovery + GENESIS | Restored orchestration, GENESIS layer created |
| Oracle6 | Semantic Annealment | 18 lenses, bifurcation (filesystem vs Obsidian) |
| Oracle7 | Ground Truth | Documentation protocol, comprehensive verification |

**Pattern that worked (Oracle3)**:
```
orchestration/
├── directives/           # Issued directives
├── execution_logs/       # Claude reports (visibility bridge)
├── scaffolding/          # Working documents
└── state/                # Living state files
```

**Category error (Oracle4)**: Applied metabolism to orchestration infrastructure. WRONG. Orchestration is operational, not content.

---

## CONSTITUTIONAL RULES

1. **Metabolism applies to CONTENT, not INFRASTRUCTURE**
   - CANON, QUEUE = content → canonize or delete
   - orchestration/ = infrastructure → maintain, never metabolize

2. **Verify before declare**
   - Examine actual files, not reports about files
   - Oracle6 failed by evaluating execution logs, not filesystem

3. **Repository is Foyer**
   - All context accessible to any agent
   - No hidden assumptions, no implicit knowledge

4. **Globe before trees**
   - Holistic framing before tactical work
   - Macroscopic view before detail

5. **Maximum resolution**
   - Never sacrifice nuance for simplicity
   - Document everything with Principal's actual words

6. **Orchestration infrastructure is protected**
   - state/, execution_logs/, directives/ = living systems
   - NEVER delete; maintain and update

## THE 18 EVALUATIVE LENSES

Every strategic decision evaluated against:

**Original Nine (Oracle4)**:
1. Syncrescendent Route — Continuous, recursive amplification
2. Bitter Lesson — Leverage computation, not hand-crafting
3. Antifragile — Gain from disorder
4. Meet the Moment — Serve now, prepare for future
5. Steelman & Redteam — Subject to strongest challenge
6. Personal Idiosyncrasies — Respect Principal's cognition
7. Potency Without Resolution Loss — Maintain nuance
8. Elegance + Developer Happiness — Simple, clear, satisfying
9. Agentify + Human-Navigable — Both can traverse

**Extended Nine (Oracle6)**:
10. First Principles — Irreducible truths
11. Systems Thinking — Parts relate to whole
12. Industrial Engineering — Minimize waste, maximize throughput
13. Complexity Theory — Essential vs accidental complexity
14. Permaculture — Self-sustaining
15. Design Thinking — Human-centered
16. Agile — Rapid iteration
17. Lean — Eliminate waste
18. Six Sigma — Minimize defects

**Threshold**: Minimum 12/18 lenses must pass.

    └── scaffolding/      # Working documents
```

### CANON Numbering
```
00000       = SCHEMA (navigational entry)
00001-00004 = GENESIS (ORIGIN, LINEAGE, PRINCIPLES, EVOLUTION)
00005-00014 = Cosmos tier (SYNCRESCENDENCE through CONTENT_PROTOCOL)
10000-11999 = Core tier
20000-25999 = Lattice tier
30000-35999 = Chain tier (Intelligence, Information, Insight, Expertise, Knowledge, Wisdom)
99000       = Meta tier (HISTORICAL)
```

### Chain Naming (CURRENT)
| Chain | Number | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Intelligence | 30xxx | AI/ML, agentic architecture |
| Information | 31xxx | Content processing, IIC implementation |
| Insight | 32xxx | Analysis, synthesis, coherence |
| Expertise | 33xxx | Business, operations, efficacy |
| Knowledge | 34xxx | Learning, curriculum, mastery |
| Wisdom | 35xxx | Transcendence, neurodivergent patterns |

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Before ANY execution:
1. **Survey comprehensively** — List everything, count patterns
2. **Identify ALL issues** — Not just the ones in the directive
3. **Plan holistically** — Address everything in one pass

### During execution:
4. **Delete what's marked for deletion** — Don't leave vestiges
5. **Move what's misplaced** — Don't leave orphans at root
6. **Verify each action** — Confirm file exists/doesn't exist

### After execution:
7. **Run ALL verification commands** — Don't claim done without checking
8. **Produce comprehensive log** — Document everything
9. **Report any anomalies** — Don't hide problems

---

## COMMON FAILURES TO AVOID

| Failure | Example | Prevention |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Narrow execution | Only addressing directive scope | Survey ENTIRE repository first |
| Claiming completion | "Done" without verification | Run ALL verification commands |
| Rename without delete | GENESIS→CANON but GENESIS still exists | Delete source after confirmed creation |
| Report-based evaluation | Trusting execution logs | Examine actual filesystem |
| Lost context | Not knowing why a decision was made | Include this document |
| Mechanical execution | Following steps without understanding | Read Oracle Decisions section |

---

## WHEN IN DOUBT

1. **Search project knowledge** for relevant CANON documents
2. **Reference this context document** for decisions
3. **Ask before assuming** if something seems unclear
4. **Err toward comprehensiveness** over narrow execution
5. **Globe before trees** — Always understand the whole before the part
