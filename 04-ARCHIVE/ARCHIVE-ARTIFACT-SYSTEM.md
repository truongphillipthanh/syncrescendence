## Pattern Language Vision

These 21 artifacts constitute a **generative grammar** for collaborative human-AI practice. Each artifact:

1. **Defines a pattern** — Reusable solution to recurring challenge
2. **Connects to others** — Forms coherent language through inter-artifact references
3. **Evolves through use** — Improves via community contribution and validation
4. **Enables composition** — Combines with other patterns for complex solutions

The system enables practitioners to:
- Share effective practices across contexts
- Build on each other's discoveries
- Evolve the pattern language collectively
- Maintain coherence while enabling diversity
