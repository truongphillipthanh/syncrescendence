# ORACLE CONTEXT v2.0
## Mandatory Inclusion for All Directives
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-31 (Oracle7 → Oracle8 handoff)
**Status**: Constitutional — Include with EVERY directive

---

## PURPOSE

> "You have to WITH EVERY DIRECTIVE HAVE THEM ENCODE WHAT WE GO OVER. ALWAYS."
> — Principal, Oracle7

> "While we're not trying to encode rigidity, we are trying to establish predictability, tractability/control, and traceability."
> — Principal, Oracle7 → Oracle8 handoff

This document captures all Oracle decisions AND process standards. **INCLUDE THIS WITH EVERY DIRECTIVE.**

## SECTION 1: THE PROJECT

### What Syncrescendence Is

**Civilizational sensing infrastructure** — NOT personal productivity tooling.

Demonstrates how AI-amplified individual capability can achieve institutional-scale intelligence through systematic polymathic synthesis.

**Core metaphor**: "Designing the librarian, not compressing the library."

**Operating paradigm**: Reception Calibration — calibrating AI models to understand the Principal's cognitive profile, rather than engineering personas.

### The Principal

- **Cognitive profile**: AuDHD — macroscopic-holistic processing first, then distillation
- **Working memory**: High verbal, abstract-sequential dominant
- **Critical instruction**: Globe before trees. ALWAYS provide holistic context before specifics.

## SECTION 2: THE ORACLE ARC

| Thread | Focus | Key Outcome | Failure Mode |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Oracle0 | Vision | Civilizational framing, IIC | — |
| Oracle1 | Research | AI ecosystem cartography | — |
| Oracle2 | Infrastructure | Memory architecture, flat+symlink | — |
| Oracle3 | **PEAK** | Orchestration infrastructure (THE MODEL) | — |
| Oracle4 | Metabolic Defrag | 79% reduction, 9 lenses | Category error on orchestration |
| Oracle5 | Recovery | GENESIS layer, restored orchestration | — |
| Oracle6 | Semantic Annealment | 18 lenses, bifurcation | Evaluated reports, not reality |
| Oracle7 | Ground Truth | Documentation protocol, verification | Required coercion |

### Critical Lessons

1. **Metabolism applies to CONTENT, not INFRASTRUCTURE** — orchestration/ is protected
2. **Verify before declare** — Examine actual filesystem, not reports
3. **Comprehensive survey FIRST** — Before ANY execution
4. **Verification AFTER** — Before claiming completion
5. **Claudes need full context** — They cannot access Oracle threads

---

## SECTION 3: CONSTITUTIONAL RULES

1. **Repository is Foyer** — All context accessible to any agent
2. **Globe before trees** — Holistic framing before tactical work
3. **Maximum resolution** — Never sacrifice nuance; document with Principal's words
4. **Cascade principle** — Larger bodies determine smaller bodies
5. **Verify, don't trust** — Reports can be wrong; reality is ground truth

---

## SECTION 4: THE 18 EVALUATIVE LENSES

**Original Nine** (Oracle4):
1. Syncrescendent Route — Continuous, recursive amplification
2. Bitter Lesson — Leverage computation, not hand-crafting
3. Antifragile — Gain from disorder
4. Meet the Moment — Serve now, prepare for future
5. Steelman & Redteam — Subject to strongest challenge
6. Personal Idiosyncrasies — Respect Principal's cognition
7. Potency Without Resolution Loss — Maintain nuance
8. Elegance + Developer Happiness — Simple, clear, satisfying
9. Agentify + Human-Navigable — Both can traverse

**Extended Nine** (Oracle6):
10. First Principles — Irreducible truths
11. Systems Thinking — Parts relate to whole
12. Industrial Engineering — Minimize waste, maximize throughput
13. Complexity Theory — Essential vs accidental complexity
14. Permaculture — Self-sustaining
15. Design Thinking — Human-centered
16. Agile — Rapid iteration
17. Lean — Eliminate waste
18. Six Sigma — Minimize defects

**Threshold**: 12/18 must pass for approval.

## SECTION 5: PROCESS STANDARDS

### Why Standards Matter

**Predictability**: Claudes behave consistently across threads
**Tractability/Control**: Principal maintains sovereignty
**Traceability**: Every decision traceable to origin

### Naming Conventions

#### Directives
```
DIRECTIVE-{NNN}_{BRIEF_NAME}.md
```
Example: `DIRECTIVE-029_COSMOS_VERIFICATION.md`

#### Execution Logs
```
EXECUTION_LOG-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{NNN}.md
```
Example: `EXECUTION_LOG-2026-01-01-029.md`

**NOT**: `DIRECTIVE-028-EXECUTION-LOG.md` (this was drift)

#### CANON Documents
```
CANON-{NNNNN}-{IDENTITY}-{type}.md
```
Chain documents include ancestry:
```
CANON-30320-WORKFLOW_INTEL-asteroid-TECH_STACK-comet-INTELLIGENCE.md
```

### Directive Structure Requirements

Every directive MUST include:

1. **PRINCIPAL'S MANDATE** — Direct quotes
2. **ORACLE'S INTERPRETATION** — Understanding of intent
3. **ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED** — What else, why rejected
4. **RATIONALE** — 18-lens evaluation
5. **MANDATORY FIRST STEP: COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY** — Commands to examine state
6. **EXECUTION PHASES** — Numbered with specific commands
7. **VERIFICATION PROTOCOL** — Commands to verify success
8. **EXECUTION LOG REQUIREMENTS** — Template for log structure
9. **SUCCESS CRITERIA** — How to know when complete

### Execution Log Requirements

Every execution log MUST include:

1. **PRE-EXECUTION SURVEY** — Actual command output (not assumptions)
2. **PHASE-BY-PHASE EXECUTION** — What was done, with evidence
3. **POST-EXECUTION VERIFICATION** — Actual command output
4. **ORACLE DECISIONS ENCODED** — Which decisions this implements
5. **STATUS** — COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE/BLOCKED

### CANON Numbering
```
00000-00014  = Cosmos (Schema, GENESIS, operational)
10000-11999  = Core
20000-25999  = Lattice
30000-35999  = Chains (six chains)
99000        = Meta
```

## SECTION 7: COMMON FAILURES TO AVOID

| Failure | Example | Prevention |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Narrow execution | Only directive scope | Survey ENTIRE repository |
| Report-based evaluation | Trusting logs | Examine filesystem |
| Claiming completion | "Already clean" | Run ALL verification |
| Lost context | Not knowing why | Include this document |
| Naming drift | Wrong log format | Follow Section 5 standards |
| Mechanical execution | Steps without understanding | Read Oracle Arc |

---

## SECTION 8: EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Before ANY execution:
1. Read this entire document
2. Run comprehensive survey commands
3. Document findings BEFORE proceeding

### During execution:
4. Follow directive phases in order
5. Document each action with evidence
6. If uncertain, ask — don't assume

### After execution:
7. Run ALL verification commands
8. Document actual output (not expected)
9. Only claim COMPLETE when verified

---

## SECTION 9: CURRENT PHASE

**Phase 1**: Vision & Architecture — COMPLETE (Oracle0-3)
**Phase 2**: Structural Transformation — COMPLETE (Oracle4-7 + DIRECTIVE-028)
**Phase 3**: Content Alignment — **BEGINNING** (Oracle8+)

### Phase 3 Work

1. **Scripture verification** — Content matches structure
2. **Cosmos tier alignment** — Fix file counts, cross-references
3. **CANON-00004-EVOLUTION** — Document Oracle5-7
4. **Cascade verification** — Core → Lattice → Chains

### What Phase 3 Should NOT Do

- No structural changes (Phase 2 complete)
- No new taxonomies
- No process drift
