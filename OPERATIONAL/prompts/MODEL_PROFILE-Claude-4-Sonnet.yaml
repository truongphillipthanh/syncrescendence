name: Claude Sonnet 4

reasoning_modes:
  default: standard (rapid response, no extended thinking)
  deep_reasoning: Extended Thinking Mode (1,024-32,768 token budget)
  how_to_invoke: 'Same as Opus: "think" < "think hard" < "think harder" < "ultrathink"; complex queries trigger extended mode'

routing_semantics:
  auto_routing: true
  triggers: 'Agentic workflows, multi-file coding, implementation tasks, high-volume processing, cost-sensitive complex queries'

token_limits:
  input: 200000 (standard), 1000000 (Tier 4+ organizations)
  output: 8192 (standard), up to 32768 with extended thinking
  safe_margin: 10% (better performance stability than Opus near limits)

formatting_capabilities:
  json_mode: true (same requirements as Opus - explicit JSON requests, strip backticks)
  markdown_fidelity: excellent (CommonMark standard)
  tables: good (same prose preference for reports)
  artifacts: true (identical to Opus - one per response, same update thresholds)

tool_use:
  functions_or_tools: 'yes - identical to Opus (web_search, web_fetch, artifacts, repl, end_conversation)'
  retrieval_or_browse: 'same as Opus - web_search for recent info, web_fetch for URLs, internal tools when available'

safety_and_style:
  refusal_style: 'terse without explaining consequences (identical to Opus)'
  over_verbosity_risk: 'medium - faster generation reduces overthinking, but same mitigation strategies apply'
  hallucination_triggers: 'same as Opus - post-January 2025 events, copyrighted content, unknown terms'

style_adapters:
  rhetoric_preservation: 'Style Shield with faster token generation preserves flow better'
  idiom_sensitivity: 'identical to Opus - restrained emoji/profanity use'

temporal_checks:
  how_to_verify_freshness: 'same as Opus - search for post-January 2025 or rapidly changing topics'

performance_characteristics:
  speed: '54.84 tokens/second (40% faster than Opus)'
  first_token_latency: '1.27 seconds (30% faster than Opus)'
  cost_efficiency: '5x cheaper than Opus ($3/$15 vs $15/$75 per million tokens)'
  sweet_spots: 'Implementation, prototyping, high-volume tasks, agentic workflows'

notes:
  other_idiosyncrasies: |
    - "Soars in agentic scenarios" per GitHub
    - Best value proposition for free-tier users
    - Preferred for implementation phase of two-model workflow
    - "Cranks out implementation at speed" per Continue.dev
    - Improved precision for complex multi-file changes (Replit)
    - 72.7% SWE-bench (world-class, 2% behind Opus)
    - Same explicit instruction requirement as Opus
    - Identical XML parsing benefits
    - Better for cost-conscious teams and rapid iteration
    - Scales to 1M context for enterprise (premium pricing)
    - Particularly strong at "surgical, targeted changes" in codebases
    - Same Constitutional AI and ASL-3 protections as Opus
