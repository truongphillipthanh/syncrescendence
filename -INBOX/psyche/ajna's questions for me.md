 Stream C landed — full OpenClaw web research synthesis written to
 04-SOURCES/research/openclaw/SYNTHESIS-openclaw.md. Created by Peter Steinberger (PSPDFKit
 founder), went through four name changes before "OpenClaw," and the key finding is it's
 architecturally unique as a persistent daemon rather than an agent framework — which is
 exactly why it fits as the 9th Constellation role. All three toolchain syntheses are now in
 the corpus (Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenClaw). Ready for the convergence pass whenever you want
 to cross-synthesize them.


 Yes, please claresce. Once upon a time, we created our own idiosyncratic terminology and
 aligned it with claude code firstparty+consensus interaction dynamics. We’ll want to do the
 same holistically to openclaw, gemini cli, and codex cli. Please refer to
 00-ORCHESTRATION/state/DYN-EXECUTION_STAGING.md. Things are all still a bit out of sync, we
 want our OpenClaw+ClaudeCode+CodexCLI+GeminiCLI to be in lock step.


 Full clarescence written to 00-ORCHESTRATION/state/ARCH-TOOLCHAIN_CLARESCENCE.md.

 What it found — the core misalignment is that CANON-31150 only covers 3 of 10+
 Constellation roles. The four CLI tools are complementary along four orthogonal dimensions:

 - Commander (Claude Code) = thinks deep (extended thinking, filesystem sovereignty)
 - Adjudicator (Codex CLI) = executes wide (parallel cloud containers, GitHub native)
 - Cartographer (Gemini CLI) = senses far (1M-2M context, corpus-scale)
 - OpenClaw (Ajna/Psyche) = persists always (only member that survives between sessions)

 No single tool covers all four. That's the argument for the lock-step model.

 The clarescence specifies a 3-stream micro-Blitzkrieg to operationalize:
 - Stream A: CANON-31150 v3.0.0 (3→7 platform entries)
 - Stream B: Missing Avatar files + 11 new Rosetta terms
 - Stream C: DYN-TOOLCHAIN_INTERACTION_PROTOCOL.md (the actual dispatch spec)

 Want me to execute any of these streams, or do you want to review the clarescence first?
