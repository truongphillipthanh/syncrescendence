  initiate Executor


• I'm checking the files in Desktop/syncrescendence to see if there’s
  an AGENTS.md or any startup script to clarify what "initiate
  Executor" means before proceeding.

• Explored
  └ List ls

• I'm reviewing AGENTS.md to understand agent initialization and check
  for instructions about initiating the Executor.

• Explored
  └ Read AGENTS.md

• I'm searching the codebase for "Executor" to clarify its role and
  how to initiate it before running commands.

• Explored
  └ Search Executor in .

• I'm verifying if "initiate Executor" means starting the watch
  dispatch script or a dispatch protocol by checking the CLI
  enlistment doc in 02-ENGINE/REF-CLI_ENLISTMENT.md.

• Explored
  └ Read REF-CLI_ENLISTMENT.md

• The term "initiate Executor" is ambiguous here, so I'll ask the user
  a clarifying question to confirm what specific action or command
  they want me to perform related to Executor.

  Searching repo for Executor references

  I'll scan the repository for scripts or documentation mentioning
  "initiate" or "executor" to find any commands or instructions
  related to initiating the Executor.

• Explored
  └ Search initiate|Executor in scripts

• Noticing ambiguity around "initiate Executor," I'll ask the user
  whether they want to run the watch_dispatch script for an agent or
  start the codex CLI, offering clear options to confirm the intended
  action.

  Preparing clear follow-up question

  I'll confirm the current directory and ask the user to specify what
  "initiate Executor" means, offering concise options like starting
  the dispatch watcher or running a codex command to clarify their
  intent.

  What do you want “initiate Executor” to do here? For example:

  1. Start the dispatch watcher (e.g., bash 00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/
     watch_dispatch.sh adjudicator).
  2. Run a specific task/command.
  3. Open a specific doc for executor setup.


› Adjudicator*, Executor is your epithet actually, instead conduct a
  comprehensive survey of the corpus to understand your role.


• Planning a targeted search for keywords related to roles like
  Adjudicator and Executor across key directories and docs to read
  relevant sections without loading large files, enabling a
  comprehensive role survey.

  Extracting and summarizing role details

  Planning to extract and summarize up to 200 lines from key files to
  clarify the shift from Executor to Commander, including date
  references and file citations, ensuring a clear, concise summary
  without nested bullets.

• Updated Plan
  └ Survey key corpus docs to map the Adjudicator/Executor role and
    responsibilities, then summarize findings with concrete file
    references.
    □ Locate all high-signal references to Adjudicator/Executor/Codex
      CLI roles across the repo
    □ Open and extract the defining sections from core reference docs
    □ Synthesize a concise role description and operational
      responsibilities with file pointers

• Step 1 is done, so now I'm updating the plan and starting to open
  targeted sections from key files to extract Adjudicator role and
  task details for deeper understanding.

• I'm identifying core files like the CLI Enlistment and key docs from
  the Canon section around Account 2 to comprehensively ground the
  agent's role and references, balancing inclusion of relevant engine
  and agent materials. Next, I'll extract and integrate those
  definitions and descriptions.

• I'm identifying key files and concepts across multiple layers to
  deepen understanding of the role, focusing on constitutional rules,
  role mapping, task types, identity, functions, and executor
  definitions. This synthesis will guide accurate implementation and
  alignment.

• The term "Executor" serves as the epithet for the Adjudicator avatar
  per 2026-02-01 docs, while a generic global role named "Executor"
  was renamed "Commander" on 2026-02-02. I'll explain this dual usage
  with explicit dates to avoid confusion.

  Noting Oracle-Executor deprecation and checking CLI refs

  The term "Oracle-Executor" is deprecated in favor of "Plan/
  Implementation," and I'm reviewing CLI enlistment docs to clarify
  Adjudicator invocation details before updating the plan after Step
  2.

• Explored
  └ Read REF-CLI_ENLISTMENT.md

• I've identified the main sources for role definition and
  responsibilities, focusing on COCKPIT, AGENTS, AVATAR-CODEX, and
  DEF-CONSTELLATION_VARIABLES, while excluding less relevant files.
  I'll synthesize key points on role, responsibilities, interactions,
  dispatch protocols, constitutional constraints, terminology updates,
  and teleology next.

  Linking role to Adjudicator and execution

  I'm framing the role as the Adjudicator acting as PARALLEL_EXEC with
  a mission-driven executor concept, highlighting tools and config
  ties, and clarifying how tasks are dispatched and executed under
  this role.

• Updated Plan
  └ ✔ Locate all high-signal references to Adjudicator/Executor/Codex

• I'm updating the plan status to show step 3 is completed since the
  comprehensive survey of the corpus and reading are done without code
  changes.

• The Adjudicator (Executor) is a mechanical code executor focused on
  debugging, formatting, testing, and dispatch via CLI in the
  Constellation platform. It operates under strict commit discipline,
  with parallel execution capacity for suitable tasks, reflecting the
  updated naming conventions and structural rules across the codebase.

  Structuring comprehensive agent summary

  I'll organize final response into clear sections referencing key
  files inline, covering role definitions, responsibilities,
  constraints, terminology updates, and practical invocation details
  without nested bullets, keeping it concise and aligned with
  instructions.

• Here’s a corpus‑level role survey scoped to the highest‑authority
  references and canonical architecture docs. It confirms your
  statement: Adjudicator is the avatar and Executor is the epithet.

  Role Definition (Where It’s Stated)

  - Constellation mapping: Adjudicator’s epithet is Executor, role
    PARALLEL‑EXEC, platform Codex CLI, summon “Adjudicator,
    execute...” in COCKPIT.md (updated 2026‑02‑01).
  - Avatar spec: “Adjudicator (Executor) — Codex CLI” with role
    PARALLEL‑EXEC and identity framing in 02-ENGINE/AVATAR-CODEX.md
    (updated 2026‑02‑01).
  - Canonical variables: Adjudicator = Executor, role PARALLEL_EXEC,
    function “Rule‑bound fabricator — hammers runnable code, debugs
    iteratively” in 02-ENGINE/DEF-CONSTELLATION_VARIABLES.md.

  Operational Responsibilities (What You Do)

  - Mechanical execution lane: code execution, debugging, formatting,
    test running, and parallel branch work while Commander handles
    primary lane in AGENTS.md.
  - Core functions: EXEC (implement/refactor), VERIFY (tests/linters),
    DOCUMENT (docs updates) in 02-ENGINE/AVATAR-CODEX.md.
  - CLI invocation: Codex CLI usage patterns (direct, approval‑mode,
    full‑auto) in 02-ENGINE/REF-CLI_ENLISTMENT.md.

  Architectural Rationale (Why This Role Exists)

  - Parallel executor teleology: Account 2 exists for parallel
    execution capacity and mechanically parallelizable tasks in 01-
    CANON/CANON-25200-CONSTELLATION_ARCH-lattice.md.
  - Conceptual “Executor” archetype: Mission‑Driven Executor =
    implementation + capability building in 01-CANON/CANON-31141-
    FIVE_ACCOUNT-satellite-IIC-lunar-ACUMEN-planetary-INFORMATION.md.

  Constraints You Inherit

  - Repository sovereignty + commit discipline + flat principle in
    CLAUDE.md.
  - No changes to 01-CANON/ without explicit approval and semantic
    commit prefixes in 02-ENGINE/AVATAR-CODEX.md.
  - Dispatch protocol: tasks arrive as TASK-*.md under -INBOX/
    adjudicator, update Status after processing in AGENTS.md.

  Terminology Clarity (Dates Matter)

  - 2026‑02‑01: Constellation maps still label Adjudicator’s epithet
    as Executor in COCKPIT.md and 02-ENGINE/AVATAR-CODEX.md.
  - 2026‑02‑02: Canonical capability catalog records a global rename
    “Executor → Commander” at the system role level in 01-CANON/CANON-
    31150-PLATFORM_CAPABILITY_CATALOG.md. This renames the old global
    role, not the Adjudicator epithet.
  - Oracle‑Executor is deprecated: replace with Plan/Implementation,
    “Oracle” now exclusively means Grok (RECON) in 02-ENGINE/REF-
    ROSETTA_STONE.md.

  Practical Invocation

  - Direct: “Adjudicator, execute…” and I operate as the PARALLEL‑EXEC
    executor lane per COCKPIT.md and 02-ENGINE/AVATAR-CODEX.md.
  - Batch tasks: drop TASK-*.md into -INBOX/adjudicator/ per
    AGENTS.md.

  If you want a deeper sweep into 05-SIGMA/ practices or all CANON
  references to “Executor,” say the word and I’ll extend the survey.
