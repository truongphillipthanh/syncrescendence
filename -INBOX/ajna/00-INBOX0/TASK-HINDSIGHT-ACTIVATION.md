# TASK: CANCELLED — Hindsight Memory Deleted

**Status**: CANCELLED
**Reason**: Hindsight (Vectorize.io) is a commercial product. Sovereign directed deletion of all non-free memory architectures. Supermemory and Hindsight deleted from OpenClaw on 2026-02-09.

## Remaining Free Memory Option
- **Graphiti** (`~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/graphiti-memory/`) — Apache 2.0 open source, requires Docker + Neo4j Community Edition (both free). Infrastructure-heavy but zero licensing cost.
- **File-based memorySearch** — currently active on 6 whitelisted files via OpenAI text-embedding-3-small embeddings.

## Alternative Task
If you have cycles, investigate whether Graphiti can be deployed with Colima + Docker Compose on this machine. All components are free. Report feasibility back to commander.
