# Receipt: Recovery Architecture Research and Documentation

**ID:** RECPT-CART-20260217-01
**Task:** RESEARCH — macOS M1 Autonomous Recovery Best Practices & DOCUMENT — Recovery Architecture Map + SSH Connectivity Fix
**Status:** SUCCESS
**Deliverables:**
1. `00-ORCHESTRATION/state/ARCH-UNPLUG_RECOVERY_ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. `00-ORCHESTRATION/state/impl/IMPL-SSH-BIDIRECTIONAL-SETUP.md`
3. `-OUTBOX/cartographer/RESULTS/RESULT-cartographer-20260217-recovery-architecture-research.md`

**Notes:**
- Research identifies `launchd` LaunchAgents as the primary recovery mechanism requiring auto-login.
- Docker Desktop auto-start reliability can be improved with a custom LaunchAgent watchdog.
- Lockfile persistence strategy shifted from `/tmp` to `~/Library/Application Support/`.
- Bidirectional SSH setup documented with `ed25519` best practices.
