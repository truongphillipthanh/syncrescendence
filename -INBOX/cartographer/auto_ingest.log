# Corpus Freshness & Reference Audit | 2026-02-21

## 1. Corpus Freshness Summary

| Zone | File Count | Last Significant Update | Freshness Status |
|------|------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| 01-CANON/ | 79 | 2025-12-30 (majority) | **STALE** |
| 00-ORCHESTRATION/state/ | ~150 | 2026-02-21 (today) | **LIVE** |
| 05-SIGMA/mechanics/ | 5 | 2026-02-17 | **FRESH** |

### Observations:
- **Canonical Drift**: 90% of the \`01-CANON/\` directory has not been updated in ~53 days. Only a few lattice/lattice-related files (\`CANON-25200\`, \`CANON-25000\`) show recent February activity.
- **Orchestration Activity**: High-frequency updates in \`DYN-CONSTELLATION_STATE\` snapshots (140+ versions) indicate intense operational activity today.

## 2. Reference Integrity Audit

### Broken Links (Missing Files)
The following references point to non-existent files:
- \`[[CANON-00008-RESOLUTIONS-cosmos]]\` (Referenced in \`CANON-00004\`)
- \`[[CANON-00009-STRATEGY]]\` (Should be \`CANON-00009-STRATEGY-cosmos\`)
- \`[[CANON-30450]]\` (Should be \`CANON-30450-PRODUCTION_FRAMEWORKS-asteroid-INTELLIGENCE\`)

### Placeholder & Mock References
Multiple files contain "scaffold" links that were never resolved to actual sources:
- \`[[Book A]]\`, \`[[Book B]]\`, \`[[Book C]]\`
- \`[[Paper A]]\`, \`[[Paper B]]\`, \`[[Paper C]]\`
- \`[[CANON-XXXXX]]\`

### Abbreviated Link Fragmentation
A significant pattern was detected where wikilinks use abbreviated IDs instead of full canonical filenames. This breaks standard Markdown/Obsidian resolution:
- **Linked**: \`[[CANON-25000-MEMORY_ARCH]]\`
- **Actual**: \`CANON-25000-MEMORY_ARCH-lattice.md\`
- **Status**: Technically broken in vanilla Markdown parsers.

## 3. Structural Health
- **Orphan Count**: 0 files in \`01-CANON/\`. 
- **Connectivity**: 100% of canonical files are reachable via at least one inbound wikilink.
- **Redundancy**: Multiple \`DYN-CONSTELLATION_STATE\` files (\`1\`, \`2\`, \`3\`, etc.) suggest potential disk bloat in the state directory.

## 4. Recommendations
1. **Canonical Re-Sync**: Trigger a "Corpus-wide Annealment" to update \`updated:\` fields and verify content against current system state.
2. **Link Normalization**: Standardize all abbreviated links to match full filenames to ensure cross-platform tool compatibility.
3. **Placeholder Resolution**: Audit \`CANON-31142\` and others to replace "Book/Paper" placeholders with real research citations.
4. **State Cleanup**: Archival or pruning of old \`DYN-CONSTELLATION_STATE\` versions to reduce directory noise.
