## Task Result: PARTIAL

**TASK-20260212-mba_apply_adj_carto_hardening** — executed with partial results.

### What succeeded:
- **git pull --ff-only** — repo updated (ff to `72c2efb`)
- Task status updated to `PARTIAL` in the INBOX file

### What was blocked:
**All 8 remaining steps** were blocked by Claude Code's sandbox — `brew`, `codex`, `gemini`, and `launchctl` are system-level commands that require explicit user approval in the permission dialog, which was not granted.

### Two issues identified:

1. **Host mismatch**: The task says "Actions on MBA Commander host" but this session runs on **M1-Mac-mini**. The `--psyche` flag in step 3 targets MBA plists; Mac mini needs `--mini`. Dispatch should include a `Target-Host` field.

2. **Sandbox incompatibility**: Claude Code cannot execute arbitrary system CLIs. This class of task (brew upgrades, launchctl management, CLI smoke tests) should be either:
   - Run directly in terminal
   - Dispatched to Codex CLI (`--full-auto`) which has fewer restrictions
   - Or you can approve the commands when prompted

### To complete manually, run in terminal:
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/syncrescendence && git pull --ff-only
brew upgrade codex && codex --version
bash 00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/rearm_watchers.sh --mini   # --mini for Mac mini, --psyche for MBA
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.syncrescendence.watch-adjudicator
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.syncrescendence.watch-cartographer
codex exec -m gpt-5.2-codex -c 'model_reasoning_effort="high"' 'Reply exactly: MBA_ADJ_OK'
ls -d ~/.agents/skills/*/ | wc -l && ls -d ~/.codex/skills/*/ | wc -l
gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro -p 'Reply exactly: MBA_CARTO_OK'
launchctl list | grep syncrescendence
```

The RESULT file write to `-OUTBOX/` was also blocked by permissions. The task INBOX file has been updated with PARTIAL status.
