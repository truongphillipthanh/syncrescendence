## Task Complete: MBA Adjudicator Model Recovery

### Root Cause
The `resolve_codex_model()` function in cockpit.sh/watch_dispatch.sh/watchdog.sh prefers `gpt-5.3-codex` — but that's **Psyche's model** (Account 1). The Adjudicator runs on **Account 2** which only has access to `gpt-5.2-codex`. When the model cache (or absence thereof) resolved to `gpt-5.3-codex`, the Codex CLI threw `model does not exist or no access`.

### Changes Made (committed to repo)
All 3 adjudicator watcher plist templates now have `SYNCRESCENDENCE_CODEX_MODEL=gpt-5.2-codex` in their EnvironmentVariables:
- `launchd-psyche/com.syncrescendence.watch-adjudicator.plist` (MBA)
- `launchd-mini/com.syncrescendence.watch-adjudicator.plist` (Mac mini)
- `launchd/com.syncrescendence.watch-adjudicator.plist` (generic)

This bypasses the cache-based resolution entirely for the watcher, using the env variable that `resolve_codex_model()` already checks first (lines 40-42 in cockpit.sh).

### Manual Steps Required (Sovereign)

1. **Upgrade Codex CLI**: `brew upgrade codex && codex --version`
2. **Shell env** (for cockpit/watchdog tmux context): Add `export SYNCRESCENDENCE_CODEX_MODEL=gpt-5.2-codex` to `~/.zshrc`
3. **Reload watcher plist**:
   ```bash
   cp 00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/launchd-psyche/com.syncrescendence.watch-adjudicator.plist \
      ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.syncrescendence.watch-adjudicator.plist
   launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.syncrescendence.watch-adjudicator 2>/dev/null || true
   launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.syncrescendence.watch-adjudicator.plist
   ```
4. **Smoke test**: `codex exec -m gpt-5.2-codex "echo hello from adjudicator"`
5. **Verify logs**: `tail -50 /tmp/syncrescendence-watch-adjudicator.log`

### Rollback
Remove the `SYNCRESCENDENCE_CODEX_MODEL` key/string pair from the plist EnvironmentVariables dict. The resolve function reverts to cache-based resolution.

**Note**: The RESULT file write to `-OUTBOX/commander/RESULTS/` was blocked by sandbox permissions. The analysis above serves as the result artifact. The task file has been updated to COMPLETE status.
