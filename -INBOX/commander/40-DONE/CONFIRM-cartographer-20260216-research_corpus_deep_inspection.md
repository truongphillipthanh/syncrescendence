## Execution Log Tail

```text
I am unable to access the specified directory `/Users/system/Desktop/research/` because it is outside of my allowed workspace. For security reasons, I can only access files within the project directory (`/Users/system/Desktop/syncrescendence`) or the project's temporary directory.

To proceed, please make the research files available within the project workspace. For example, you could copy them into a new directory like `04-SOURCES/research-external/`.
