Explain Palantir's ontology

---

How does it integrate with the rest of its stack? I understand that their commercial and institutional are bifurcated, but the rest is connected right?

---

Let's take a hypothetical of one of its most complex imaginary commercial customer. What are all the different types of software types or categories (not sure which is appropriate) will Ontology be integrating? And then please elucidate holistically, assuming this company is employing Palantir's full stack (obvs minus Gotham)

---

Let's reimagine this post-singularity, where corporations are the new nation-states, and individuals+ai are the new corporations. What do these stacks become? Decompose the software type/categories into a functional essence, then reify them from first principles. The how would Palantir's stack look forward deployedly engineered to the individual? Conduct a deep hermeneutical architectural synthesis. For fun, at the end, imagine what the nation-state becomes in this world.
