# ⚠️ EMERGENCY ASCERTESCENCE — CC30 ⚠️
# ZERO TRUST MODE: Every claim requires evidence. Every pathway requires destination.

**Explicit Confirmation Thesis**  
Repo traversal (GitHub main branch at 1eb3d68, Feb 24 2026 chore: propagate AGENTS.md v6.0.0; local HEAD bf38e49a4770b75b2fc53063b8c215861e9e2bd1, Feb 25 2026 emergency: CC30 culmination — Oracle landed, 4-connection convergence) confirms your assessment verbatim. bf38e49a is the correct CC30 safe build point containing the hermeneutical exegesis, session handoff, and valuable culmination work. 1eb3d68 is the remote pre-CC30 clean state and would nuke four local commits (including bf38e49a itself). The mass-stamp corruption (27–29 files) is the only element to excise. Untracked files (RESPONSE-ADJUDICATOR-CC30.md in 3 locations, RESPONSE-ORACLE-ASCERTESCENCE-CC30.md, HANDOFF-CC31-CULMINATION-SESSION_TERMINAL.md) survive any checkout or reset because git never touches untracked content.  

**Answer to 1**: No — do **not** use 1eb3d68. Use **bf38e49a** as the reset point. This preserves every CC30 culmination commit while restoring clean AGENTS.md / generated files pre-mass-stamp.  

**Answer to 2**: Yes — the untracked culmination files survive untouched. They are the exact inputs we execute against after recovery.  

**Exact Safe Recovery Commands (Execute in This Order)**  
```bash
cd /Users/system/syncrescendence

# 1. Reset to CC30 safe point (preserves culmination commits)
git reset --hard bf38e49a4770b75b2fc53063b8c215861e9e2bd1

# 2. Verify no banner duplication in sources
head -n 20 AGENTS.md
tail -n 10 AGENTS.md

# 3. Clean any lingering uncommitted stamp on generated files only
git checkout bf38e49a4770b75b2fc53063b8c215861e9e2bd1 -- CLAUDE.md GEMINI.md

# 4. Now apply banner to sources only (as Sovereign directive requires)
#    Edit AGENTS.md and CLAUDE-EXT.md with the verbatim header/footer
#    (do not touch templates, INIT.md, DYN-*, historical handoffs, or MEMORY.md files)

# 5. Propagate cleanly
make configs

# 6. Commit the clean banner
git add AGENTS.md CLAUDE-EXT.md
git commit -m "fix: CC30 emergency banner in sources only (AGENTS.md + CLAUDE-EXT.md) — recovery complete"
git push
```

This sequence satisfies PHASE GATE RULE, Repo Sovereignty, and Receipts invariants (AGENTS.md v6.0.0 constitutional rules). The 29-file mass corruption is excised without losing any CC30 culmination work. Untracked RESPONSE-* and HANDOFF files remain exactly as they are.

Once the above completes and git status shows clean, Sovereign Objective Lock on the OL-5 protocol, then dispatch the Commander prompt and Diviner questions I supplied in the previous turn. The first 5-atom crystallization follows immediately.

The system is annealed, not destroyed. Execute the commands above now.
