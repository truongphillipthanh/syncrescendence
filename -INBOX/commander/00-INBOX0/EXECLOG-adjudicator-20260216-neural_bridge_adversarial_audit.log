## Objective

ADVERSARIAL AUDIT of Neural Bridge implementation — independent verification.

## Objective
You are running an INDEPENDENT adversarial audit of the Neural Bridge (SSH bidirectional link MBA ↔ Mac mini). Psyche is simultaneously committing code. Your job is to verify EVERY surface independently.

## Audit Checklist (run ALL commands, include ALL output in RESULT)

### 1. Env Var Audit
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
env | grep SYNCRESCENDENCE_REMOTE
```
Expected: AJNA=macbook-air, all others=local. Flag ANY value containing 'mac-mini' (old, wrong).

### 2. SSH Config Audit  
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/config
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 -o BatchMode=yes macbook-air hostname
```
Expected: Config shows macbook-air alias, SSH returns MBA hostname. Flag if hostname is wrong or key is wrong.

### 3. dispatch.sh SCP Sling Audit
```bash
grep -n 'REMOTE_AGENT_HOST' ~/Desktop/syncrescendence/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/dispatch.sh | head -20
```
Verify dispatch.sh reads the env vars correctly and skips SCP for 'local'.

### 4. auto_ingest CONFIRM SCP-back Audit
```bash
grep -n -A15 'Neural Bridge' ~/Desktop/syncrescendence/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/auto_ingest_loop.sh
```
Verify: SCP-back code exists, uses correct env var pattern, handles 'local' skip.

### 5. Watchdog SSH Health Audit
```bash
grep -n -A10 'Neural Bridge' ~/Desktop/syncrescendence/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/constellation_watchdog.sh
```
Verify: SSH probe exists, uses 'macbook-air' alias, writes status to health report.

### 6. OpenClaw Personality Audit
```bash
for f in SOUL.md HEARTBEAT.md MEMORY.md; do echo "=== $f ==="; grep -c 'Neural Bridge' ~/.openclaw/$f; done
```
All three must contain Neural Bridge references.

### 7. Cross-Reference: CLAUDE.md Neural Bridge Section
```bash
grep -c 'Neural Bridge' ~/Desktop/syncrescendence/CLAUDE.md
grep -c 'Neural Bridge' ~/Desktop/syncrescendence/COCKPIT.md
```
Both must contain Neural Bridge documentation.

### 8. End-to-End Simulation (DRY RUN)
If a task were dispatched from Mac mini to Ajna (who lives on MBA), trace the path:
- dispatch.sh would check SYNCRESCENDENCE_REMOTE_AGENT_HOST_AJNA → should be 'macbook-air'
- SCP would target macbook-air:~/Desktop/syncrescendence/-INBOX/ajna/00-INBOX0/
- Verify that path exists on MBA: `ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 macbook-air 'ls -d ~/Desktop/syncrescendence/-INBOX/ajna/00-INBOX0/ 2>/dev/null && echo EXISTS || echo MISSING'`

## Verdict Format
At the end of your RESULT, write:

NEURAL BRIDGE AUDIT VERDICT: PASS or FAIL
- If PASS: All 8 checks confirmed with evidence
- If FAIL: List specific failures with remediation steps

## Context Files

Consult as needed:
- `COCKPIT.md` — Constellation overview
- `CLAUDE.md` — Constitutional rules
- `00-ORCHESTRATION/state/ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md` — Active intentions
- `02-ENGINE/DEF-CONSTELLATION_VARIABLES.md` — Global definitions

## Expected Output

- Write results to `-OUTBOX/adjudicator/RESULTS/RESULT-adjudicator-20260216-neural_bridge_adversarial_audit.md`
- Or commit directly if you have write access

## Completion Protocol

1. Write output to the specified location
2. Update **Status** above from PENDING to COMPLETE
3. If cross-machine: `git add -A && git commit -m "task: neural_bridge_adversarial_audit complete" && git push`

**Clarifying handling of unexpected git changes**

I understand that if git status shows unknown modifications not made by me, I must stop and ask the user how to proceed before continuing. I'll run git status at the start to verify cleanliness and proceed only if there are no such unexpected changes.
thinking
**Planning command execution and commit strategy**

I'll run required shell commands sequentially, capturing all outputs for the result file. For committing, I'll use the Adjudicator protocol prefix (likely `chore:`) and commit changes locally without pushing unless explicitly required. I'll update the result file, task status, execution log, and ledger as needed before committing.

**Noticing unexpected modified files**

The git status shows modified files I didn't create. I’m stopping now and asking how to proceed before continuing.
