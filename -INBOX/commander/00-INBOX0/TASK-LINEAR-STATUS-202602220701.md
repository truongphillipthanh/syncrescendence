# Linear SYN Status Report — 2026-02-22 07:01

**Generated by**: claudecron/linear-status-check
**Status**: BLOCKED

## Summary

**Unable to fetch Linear data.** Two access methods attempted, both failed:

1. **Direct API (`curl`)**: `LINEAR_API_KEY` environment variable is not set in the shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.zprofile`). The cron task spec assumed it would be available, but no export was found.
2. **Linear MCP tool**: Available via `mcp__claude_ai_Linear__list_issues`, but requires interactive permission approval — incompatible with background/scheduled execution.

## Required Actions

- **Option A (preferred)**: Add `export LINEAR_API_KEY="lin_api_..."` to `~/.zshrc` on Mac mini, then this cron task will work via curl on next run.
- **Option B**: Grant the Linear MCP tool blanket permission in Claude Code settings (`allowedTools` or session pre-approval), enabling MCP-based fetches in background tasks.

## Recommendations

1. Store the Linear API key in `~/.zshrc` alongside the other `SYNCRESCENDENCE_REMOTE_AGENT_HOST_*` env vars.
2. Consider adding MCP tool pre-approvals for read-only Linear operations to the Claude Code config so scheduled tasks can use them unattended.
