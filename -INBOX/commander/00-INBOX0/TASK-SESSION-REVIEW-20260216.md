## Sessions Today

Today was one of the highest-throughput days in Syncrescendence history. Multiple Commander sessions plus autonomous agent work across all 5 constellation agents.

| Time Window (PST) | Key Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 03:00–05:30 | Ajna sync baseline, auto-compact wisdom |
| 05:30–09:30 | **Session 17 climax**: Meta-clarescence audit (48 files), 6-lane swarm execution, research corpus deep inspection, 267 files → 14 NotebookLM notebooks, 46 insights extracted, 46 backlog items injected, Rosetta v2.7.0, Runbook v3.0.0 |
| 13:00–15:45 | **Session 18 Sovereign directive**: Research partitioning finalization, decision DA-RESEARCH-PARTITION-001 recorded |
| 18:30–20:48 | **Session 18 continued**: Token economics + antifragile constellation, Cline/OpenCode reconnaissance, watchdog fixes, 3 reinforcement tasks dispatched (Cartographer, Psyche, Adjudicator), 5-pass deep sensing inspection completed |
| 22:00–23:59 | **Hardening sprint**: Auto-ingest fix, zero-offline operational encoding, Psyche hardening dispatch, Neural Bridge infrastructure begins |

## Intention Alignment

| Intention | Progress Today | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| INT-1202 "Capitalize on heavy machinery" | Massive multi-agent execution across 5 agents. ~60 substantive commits. | **On track** — peak velocity day |
| INT-1612 "Begin ALL automations" | Watchdog fixed (tmux socket), auto-ingest fix deployed, auto-compact running. Cline/OpenCode scouted but not operational yet. | **Advancing** — infrastructure hardened, open model onboarding deferred |
| INT-1701 "Progressive Disclosure" | Research corpus partitioned into 14 notebooks per progressive disclosure pattern | **On track** |
| INT-1708 "Research → NotebookLM pipeline" | 267 files partitioned, 14 notebook directories created, pipeline spec drafted. MVP not yet automated. | **Advancing** — manual partition done, automation pending |
| INT-1801 "Token Economics Dispatch" | Documented in Session 18 commit. Shared rate limit awareness codified as INT-P023. | **Captured** — policy set, not yet enforced programmatically |
| INT-1802 "Model Role Specialization" | Four-tier intelligence model documented. Psyche (5.3-codex) validated as meticulous executor. | **Captured** — policy set |
| INT-1803 "Cline + OpenCode onboarding" | Cline v2.2.2 found at `/opt/homebrew/bin/cline`. OpenCode not installed. Auth not configured. | **Stalled** — scouted only, needs OpenRouter API key setup |
| INT-1804 "Antifragile agent infrastructure" | Unplug recovery architecture dispatched → Cartographer documented → Adjudicator audited → Psyche hardened 7 blockers → Neural Bridge genetic embedding committed. FileVault disabled + autoboot configured. | **Major progress** — autonomous boot chain verified PASS |

## Commits Today (Non-Sync Substantive)

```
feat:       7 commits (session18, research partitioning, hardening, bridge, resilience, dispatch)
fix:        4 commits (auto-ingest, watchdog, resilience coordination, resilience blockers)
research:   1 commit (5-pass deep sensing)
audit:      1 commit (adversarial unplug recovery)
docs:       2 commits (bridge architecture, resilience architecture)
merge:      1 commit (MBA/mm reconciliation)
chore:      ~20 commits (heartbeats, auto-compacts, dispatch cleanup)
```

Total: ~60+ commits (including ~24 sync(ajna) automated syncs).

## Agent Activity Summary

| Agent | Tasks Claimed | Completed | Failed | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Commander | orchestrator | — | — | Drove all sessions, dispatched 6+ tasks |
| Cartographer | 3 | 2 | 1 | Research deep inspection FAILED (likely rate limit), research multipass FAILED, bridge docs COMPLETED |
| Psyche | 1 | 1 | 0 | Pipeline coherence audit + targeted 7-blocker hardening |
| Adjudicator | 2 | 2 | 0 | Architecture verification + session18 validation + adversarial audit |
| Ajna | 1 | 1 | 0 | Pipeline coherence audit (dispatched after Cartographer failure) |

## Gaps Identified

1. **Execution staging log is EMPTY**. The `DYN-EXECUTION_STAGING.md` contains only the header — no behavioral logs were written despite massive execution. Either the hook is not firing or entries auto-compacted without evidence. This is a verification gap.

2. **Cartographer failure rate**: 1 out of 3 tasks failed (33%). Gemini free-tier rate limits remain a constraint. The failover to Ajna worked, validating antifragile dispatch, but Cartographer reliability needs monitoring.

3. **INT-1803 (Cline/OpenCode)**: Scouted but zero operational progress. This is correct prioritization (infrastructure before tools), but should not drift beyond this week.

4. **No VERIFY gate evidence**: Despite the Hard-Gate Skills mandate (DEC-C3), no explicit `/verification-before-completion` artifacts are visible in today's ledger. Sessions may have verified informally without recording the gate.

## Tomorrow's Priority

1. **Neural Bridge hardening** — The bridge commits are fresh and the Psyche/Commander dispatches for verification are in-flight. Process CONFIRM/RESULT files when they land.
2. **Process inbox completions** — Multiple CONFIRM files from today's dispatches need acknowledgment.
3. **Execution staging audit** — Determine why DYN-EXECUTION_STAGING.md is empty despite ~60 commits. Fix the hook or manually backfill.
4. **INT-1803 next step** — Configure OpenRouter API key for Cline, attempt first tmux-dispatched housekeeping task.

## Token Economics

| Agent Platform | Estimated Sessions | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Commander (Claude Opus 4.6) | 4-5 sessions | Heavy context usage across multiple long sessions |
| Psyche (GPT-5.3-codex) | 1-2 | Shared ChatGPT Plus pool |
| Adjudicator (GPT-5.2-codex) | 2-3 | Shared ChatGPT Plus pool — combined pressure with Psyche |
| Cartographer (Gemini 2.5 Pro) | 3 (1 failed) | Free tier, rate limit hit |
| Ajna (Kimi K2.5) | 1 | Overflow dispatch |

Estimated API spend: Moderate-to-heavy. Anthropic API (Commander) bore the largest share. ChatGPT Plus pool was stressed by concurrent Psyche + Adjudicator work. Gemini free tier hit limits.

---

**Assessment**: Today was a **high-velocity, infrastructure-focused day**. The constellation operated as a genuine multi-agent system — all 5 agents contributed substantively. The antifragile resilience sprint (unplug recovery, Neural Bridge, autoboot) represents meaningful progress toward INT-1804. The research partitioning (267→14 notebooks) closes a major organizational debt. The gap is in verification discipline and execution log capture — the system produced enormous output but the observability layer didn't keep pace.
