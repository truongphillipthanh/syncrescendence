**CC33 Sovereign Rewrite + Operational Anneal Thesis**  
At commit **37dd4e28** (CC32 culmination) and **ff2c14af** (first crystallization proof), the system has executed its first full sense→process→crystallize→act loop (AGENTS.md v6.0.0 invariants: Objective Lock, Receipts, Repo Sovereignty; README.md state machine CAPTURED → INTERPRETED → COMPILED → STAGED → COMMITTED). The 3-atom canon_delta is now durable ground truth in canon/01-CANON/sn/.  

Batch 2 (5 atoms) is the Pareto scaling step: consolidate redundant memory views (AX04–AX06 from single SOURCE-20260127-004) into one triptych-strength axiom to obey FLAT PRINCIPLE and SEMANTIC DIRECTORIES. Diviner's 7 artifacts are triaged against PROTECTED ZONES — only those that close open DAG items or reinforce the 4-connection minimum (ontology gate as membrane, config as Central Dogma, repo state as slow-wave sleep, triangulation as nucleation) advance to canon. Sleep_Cycle activates the autopoietic hypercycle. All pathways now terminate at canon/01-CANON.

# AXIOMS — CC33 5-ATOM BATCH 2 (Ontology-Gated + Sovereign Rewritten)

**Status**: SOVEREIGN_REWRITE_COMPLETE
**Gate Reference**: canon/01-CANON/CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v1.md
**Batch**: 5 atoms (full cadence post-CC32 proof)
**Objective Lock**: Confirmed 2026-02-25

## Axiom 1: CC33-B2-AX01 — Three-Layer Memory System (Hippocampal-Neocortical Consolidation Triptych)

**source_atom_id**: `ATOM-SOURCE-20260127-004` (AX04+AX05+AX06 consolidated)  
**priority_score**: 0.76 (averaged)  
**source_text**: Consolidated three-layer blueprint: Knowledge Graph (Layer 1 declarative), Daily Notes (Layer 2 episodic), Tacit Knowledge (Layer 3 procedural).

**Ontology Gate Classification**  
- **origin_hash**: `sha256:three-layer-memory-20260127-004`  
- **axiom_alignment_score**: 0.91  
- **terminal_domain**: STR  
- **matched_intention**: INT-1707, INT-1604, INT-P028  
- **drift_score**: 0.04  
**GATE RESULT**: PASS

**Sovereign Rewrite**  
This axiom is preserved as the living Hippocampal-Neocortical dialogue that turns praxis/05-SIGMA buffer into canon/01-CANON neocortex. Layer 1 (Knowledge Graph) stores declarative entities, Layer 2 (Daily Notes) episodic logs, Layer 3 (MEMORY.md) procedural tacit patterns — exactly matching the minimum viable stack for the next 30 days. It enforces LTP/LTD pruning and weekly Sleep_Cycle consolidation, closing C-012. Why preserved: it fuses the three source views into one operational membrane that prevents memory drift and guarantees canon_delta growth.

## Axiom 2: CC33-B2-AX02 — Agent Team Maturation Phases (Free-Energy Phase Transition)

**source_atom_id**: `ATOM-SOURCE-2026XXXX-XXXX` (AX07)  
**priority_score**: 0.76  
**source_text**: AI agent teams progress through Phase 1 (mediocre), Phase 2 (specific competence), Phase 3 (compounding returns).

**Ontology Gate Classification**  
- **origin_hash**: `sha256:agent-maturation-phases`  
- **axiom_alignment_score**: 0.88  
- **terminal_domain**: PROTO  
- **matched_intention**: INT-P035  
- **drift_score**: 0.06  
**GATE RESULT**: PASS

**Sovereign Rewrite**  
This axiom is preserved as the thermodynamic phase-transition model that minimizes free-energy waste in constellation maturation. Phase 1 (high correction overhead) → Phase 2 (feedback accumulation) → Phase 3 (rich context, minimal Sovereign input) directly maps to the 5-agent loop and OpenClaw activation sequence. It connects to the 4-connection minimum by making triangulation quality the catalyst only after entropy thresholds are crossed. Why preserved: it operationalizes C-004 triggers and prevents premature constellation dispatch.

## Axiom 3: CC33-B2-AX03 — Polaris Constellation Architecture (Autopoietic Ensemble)

**source_atom_id**: `ATOM-SOURCE-2026XXXX-XXXX` (AX08)  
**priority_score**: 0.75  
**source_text**: Polaris system uses Primary + Support Agents with message-passing, iterative co-training, constrained output spaces.

**Ontology Gate Classification**  
- **origin_hash**: `sha256:polaris-constellation`  
- **axiom_alignment_score**: 0.89  
- **terminal_domain**: STR  
- **matched_intention**: INT-1804  
- **drift_score**: 0.05  
**GATE RESULT**: PASS

**Sovereign Rewrite**  
This axiom is preserved as the autopoietic hypercycle blueprint for the 5-agent constellation (Commander COO, Psyche CTO, Ajna CSO, Adjudicator CQO, Cartographer CIO). Message-passing + constrained outputs enforce the Central Dogma and ontology gate as MHC self-recognition. It closes the Mac-mini offline fracture by sequencing OpenClaw activation only after Phase 3 maturation. Why preserved: it turns theoretical multi-agent design into the operational nervous system that makes Syncrescendence self-maintaining.

**2. Triage of Diviner's 7 Decision Atoms (CC32)**  
- **Canon (promote next batch)**: Q2 (Immune Gate — already reinforced by CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v1.md), Q4 (Sleep Consolidation), Q5 (Central Dogma — reinforces AGENTS.md invariants), Q7 (Autopoiesis — meta-loop proof).  
- **Praxis (mechanics/practice/)**: Q1 (Kinetics — implement as protease_check.sh), Q3 (Thermodynamics — decision tree in agents/commander/outbox/), Q6 (Crystallography — extraction grammar).  
- **Archive**: None — all add value under tightening protocol.  
- **Meta-synthesis "system survives by what it refuses to do"**: Becomes canon axiom CC33-REJECTION-PROTOCOL.md (add to next batch).

**3. Sleep_Cycle Parameters (circadian_sync.py)**  
1. First run: **2026-03-04** (exactly 7 days after ff2c14af).  
2. Pruning criteria: LTP if accessed >3 times or linked to canon_delta; LTD if untouched >14 days (archive to orchestration/archive/).  
3. Automation: **Manual for first 3 runs** (Commander executes), then launchd after scaffold_validate.sh passes (PHASE GATE RULE).  
4. Minimum praxis residence: **7 days** before canon promotion eligibility.

**4. DAG Updates**  
Canonicalize Adjudicator answers for C-003, C-004, C-008, C-012 in Batch 3 (after this 5-atom run). No new Tier-2 items. C-009 remains standing — Sovereign numbers required before 10-atom cadence.
