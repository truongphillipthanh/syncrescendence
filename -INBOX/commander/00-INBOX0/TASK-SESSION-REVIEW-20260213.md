# Daily Session Review — 2026-02-13

**Generated by**: claudecron/session-review
**Status**: PENDING

## Sessions Today

| Time (UTC) | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|------------|----------|------------------|
| 00:00–04:45 | ~4h 45m | Skills pipeline (registry, 8 white-label wrappers, skill sync launchd), security audit (236 skills), Cartographer reactivation + MODEL-INDEX refresh, ontology ingest (295 Rosetta relations), cross-agent convergence activation, Codex upgrade smoke test, Chroma restart investigation, Sovereign Interaction Protocol codified |
| 13:00 | ~15m | Stage 31 launchd plists (watchers + sensing constellation) |
| 19:00–21:53 | Sync only | Ajna sync commits only — no substantive work |

**Total substantive sessions**: 2 (overnight burst + afternoon launchd staging)
**Dead zone**: 05:00–13:00 (8 hours), 13:15–EOD (no new work after launchd staging)

## Intention Alignment

| Intention | Progress Today | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| INT-1612 "Begin ALL automations" (P0) | 31 launchd plists staged. Watchers + sensing constellation committed. | **On track** — plists staged but need loading verification |
| INT-1209 "Temporal intelligence refresh pipeline" | MODEL-INDEX refreshed by Cartographer. Cartographer reactivated. | **Progressed** — one-shot refresh done, recurring pipeline not yet automated |
| INT-1202 "Maximum velocity during capability window" | Heavy overnight session (~30 substantive commits). Afternoon dropped off sharply. | **Mixed** — strong burst, weak sustained throughput |
| INT-1501/1503 "Close 30% autonomy gap" | Sovereign Interaction Protocol codified globally. Cross-agent convergence activation clarescence produced. | **Incremental** — policy exists, behavioral evidence of gap closure still TBD |
| INT-1504 "Cascade deployment MBA ← mini" | Ajna syncs flowing regularly. MBA SSH key install completed. | **On track** |
| INT-1601 "Syncrescript synchronized to corpus" | No progress | **Stalled** |
| INT-1603 "JIT-software / HighCommand tmux dashboard" | No progress | **Stalled** |
| INT-1604 "Web app memory audit + RAG strategy" | No progress | **Stalled** |

## Commits Today

**Total**: ~40 commits (including syncs)
**Substantive** (excluding sync/compact):

| Hash | Prefix | Summary |

| 9139346 | feat(ontology): | Ingest 295 Rosetta Bridge relations into strategic_relationships |
| f0c0090 | clarescence: | (clarescence)^3 triple-pass constellation calibration |
| 203b03d | policy(global): | Codify Sovereign Interaction Protocol — execute first, dispatch |
| 529762b | feat(skills): | ARCH-SKILL_REGISTRY.md — centralized manifest for 246 skills |
| d8d1ff1 | feat(skills): | Pipeline DAG edges, 5 skill chains, entry/terminal nodes |
| dbf996f | feat(ops): | Instant skill sync via WatchPaths launchd + extracted skill_sync.sh |
| 281897b | feat(skills): | 8 white-label wrappers for top third-party skills |
| c874a59 | task: | codex_upgrade_and_smoke_test complete |
| ffc23c0 | task: | skill_architecture_strategic_review_retry complete |

## Agent Activity

| Agent | Tasks Completed | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| Commander | 5 commits (feat/ops) | Primary driver overnight |
| Psyche | 6 task completions | Cartographer plist fix (x3), Adjudicator model update (x3) — duplicate claim/complete cycles suggest retry noise |
| Ajna | 3 task completions | SSH key install, skill architecture review (x2) |
| Adjudicator | 2 task completions | Security skill audit 236 (duplicate signal) |
| Cartographer | 1 task completion | MODEL-INDEX refresh |

## Gaps & Concerns

1. **Psyche duplicate cycles**: TASK-CARTOGRAPHER-PLIST-FIX and TASK-ADJUDICATOR-MODEL-UPDATE each show 3 claim/complete pairs in the ledger. This is either retry noise or a watcher re-firing bug. Investigate.
2. **Execution staging stale references**: All 14 auto-generated entries reference commit `69dc42d` — the ledger check is not updating its fingerprint. The `create_execution_log.sh` hook may be caching stale state.
3. **Long dead zone**: 8-hour gap (05:00–13:00 UTC) with zero activity. Launchd sensing jobs appear to fire but produce only ledger-check noise, not substantive work.
4. **Sync commit volume**: ~20 of ~40 commits are Ajna syncs. High ratio suggests the sync cadence may need throttling or the sync hook fires too aggressively.

## Tomorrow's Priority

1. **Verify launchd plists are loaded** — 31 plists were staged but `launchctl load` confirmation is missing. This blocks INT-1612 (P0).
2. **Fix execution staging fingerprint bug** — every auto-entry points to the same commit hash. Root cause the `create_execution_log.sh` hook.
3. **Investigate Psyche duplicate task cycles** — determine if watcher re-firing or claim race condition.
4. **Advance stalled intentions** — INT-1601 (Syncrescript), INT-1603 (tmux dashboard), INT-1604 (web app memory audit) have had zero movement. At minimum, create dispatch tasks.

## Token Economics

- **Estimated sessions**: 2 substantive + ~15 hook/sync fires
- **Estimated API spend**: ~$2–4 (overnight burst likely dominated; afternoon session minimal)
- **Efficiency note**: Hook fires producing duplicate ledger entries without substantive work represent wasted tokens. Consider gating hooks behind a "has HEAD changed?" check.
