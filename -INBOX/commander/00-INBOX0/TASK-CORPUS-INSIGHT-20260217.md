# Corpus Insight Report — 2026-02-17

**Generated by**: claudecron/corpus-insight
**Status**: PENDING

## Activity Summary
- Commits (last 24h): 138 total (110 sync/heartbeat, **28 substantive**)
- Files modified (last 24h): ~1,090 .md files touched
- Active intentions: 14 (4 urgent, 10+ sprint/backlog)

## Velocity Assessment

**HIGH VELOCITY on Neural Bridge + Resilience (INT-1504, INT-1612)**
The last 24h was dominated by two focused workstreams:

1. **Resilience / Unplug Recovery** (~10 commits) — Full constellation swarm (Psyche, Cartographer, Adjudicator, Commander) executed adversarial unplug recovery: FileVault disabled, autoboot configured, 7-blocker hardening, autonomous boot chain verified PASS. This directly advances **INT-1612** (Begin ALL automations) and operational continuity.

2. **Neural Bridge Hardening** (~10 commits) — Deterministic launchd env propagation, CONFIRM SCP-back routing, SSH health checks, genetic embedding on both machines. This is the circulatory system that enables **INT-1504** (Cascade deployment MBA↔Mac mini).

**Progressing**: INT-1612, INT-1504, INT-1202 (maximum velocity during capability window)
**Stalled**: INT-1201 (self-sustaining accounts — no financial commits visible), INT-1206 (IIC configs — no activity), INT-1601 (Syncrescript — no activity), INT-1602 (IIC ingestion pipeline — no activity)

## Orphaned Work

- **Wisdom auto-compaction** (2 threshold commits) — Housekeeping, maps to general operational health
- **02-ENGINE/ massive file touches** (~30 files modified) — No clear intention linkage visible for broad ENGINE edits. Likely incidental from heartbeat/state writes but warrants verification.
- **TASK-20260217-plist_env_vars** files staged for deletion (git status) — Completed task artifacts being cleaned up. Normal lifecycle.

## Ledger Gap

The Global Ledger has **no entries after 2026-02-15**. Two full days of substantive work (resilience hardening, Neural Bridge) are unrecorded. This violates Constitutional Rule 7 (ledger ground truth) and Hard-Gate CLOSE (no state change without ledger sync). The last ledger entry is an Adjudicator ecosystem health task from Feb 15.

## Recommendations

1. **CRITICAL: Backfill ledger entries for Feb 16-17 work** — 28 substantive commits across resilience and Neural Bridge workstreams have no ledger representation. Run `append_ledger.sh` for key milestones or create a REGEN entry summarizing the gap.

2. **Advance stalled sprint intentions** — INT-1206 (IIC configs), INT-1601 (Syncrescript), INT-1602 (IIC ingestion) show zero recent commits. Either dispatch tasks or explicitly defer these to prevent intention debt accumulation.

3. **Validate 02-ENGINE file modifications** — 30+ ENGINE files were touched in the last 24h. Confirm these are intentional edits tied to the resilience/bridge work and not accidental state drift from automated processes.
