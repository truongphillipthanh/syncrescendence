**Status: BLOCKED** — Two dependencies preventing execution

This task is **incomplete** due to unresolved blockers:

**Blocker 1: Sovereign Action Required (Primary)**
The Slack bot tokens required for configuration have not been provided. Per the task prerequisites:
- Slack app "Psyche" must be created at https://api.slack.com/apps
- OAuth scopes, Socket Mode, and Events must be configured
- Bot Token (`xoxb-...`) and App Token (`xapp-...`) must be delivered

**Blocker 2: IMPL-D-0044 (Secondary)**
No SSH access to Mac mini from this environment. The `revive ajna` directive and this task both depend on establishing:
- SSH alias/host-key pinning for `home@192.168.1.2` (Mac mini)
- Or physical access to Mac mini

**Receipt:**
- Task status: BLOCKED (awaiting Sovereign tokens + SSH access)
- No configuration changes attempted (no tokens to configure)
