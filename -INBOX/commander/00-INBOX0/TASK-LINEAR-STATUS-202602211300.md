## Blockers / Stale
All 20 issues are stale (no updates in >7 days). Critical attention items:

| Issue | Status | Days Stale | Concern |
|-------|--------|-----------|---------|
| SYN-24 | Todo | 15d | P0-Critical email setup — longest stale, highest priority |
| SYN-53 | In Progress | 10d | In Progress but no movement — needs completion or revert to Todo |
| SYN-51 | In Progress | 10d | In Progress but no movement — needs completion or revert to Todo |
| SYN-28 | Backlog | 15d | Large metabolism task (193 files) — needs scoping or delegation |

## Recommendations
1. **SYN-24 is P0-Critical and 15 days stale** — resolve the IIC email setup or document the blocker. This is the single highest-priority item in the board.
2. **SYN-53 and SYN-51 are "In Progress" zombies** — either push to completion with a focused session or move back to Todo to reflect reality. Stale In Progress items mask true velocity.
3. **No issues have assignees** — assign owners to at least the In Progress and High-priority Todo items to create accountability.
4. **Consider batching the PM tool onboarding** (SYN-51/52/53/54) into a single sprint — they're related and could benefit from a unified integration session.
5. **SYN-37 (Syncrescript refactor) is High priority but in Backlog** — promote to Todo if it's actually needed, or deprioritize if the Rails convention work is deferred.
