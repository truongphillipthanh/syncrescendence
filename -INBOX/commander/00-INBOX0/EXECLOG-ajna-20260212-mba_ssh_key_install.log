  `-OUTBOX/ajna/RESULTS/RESULT-ajna-20260212-mba_ssh_key_install.md`
- **Commit:**  
  `84601ad` — `task: mba_ssh_key_install complete`
- **Push:** not performed (no remote configured in this workspace)

Important context:
- The commands executed on host **`M1-Mac-mini.local`** (`whoami=home`), and the key is present in that host’s `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
- SSH checks passed on this host (port 22 open + localhost SSH auth success).
- Direct `systemsetup -getremotelogin` query requires admin rights in this environment.

If you intended this to be applied specifically on the **MBA**, run the same procedure on the MBA host/session.
