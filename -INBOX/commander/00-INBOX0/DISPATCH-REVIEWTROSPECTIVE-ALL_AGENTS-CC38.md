## SHARED PREAMBLE — What Every Agent Must Know

### What Happened

Over CC34–CC37 (4 sessions, Feb 25-26), the constellation executed its most ambitious build cycle:

- **CC34**: 11-report rendezvous summit — the most comprehensive system assessment ever produced
- **CC35**: Full 3-leg triangulation (Oracle → Diviner → Adjudicator) producing engineering specs
- **CC36**: Construction Documents, Adjudicator Bid, Contract Award, pre-construction swarm
- **CC37**: Full build — all 7 deliverables committed, integrated, Adjudicator-reviewed, remediated

Then in **CC38**, the first **strategic reviewtrospective** was executed — all 5 constellation agents contributing perspectives in a sequential compounding synthesis.

### What Was Built

| Deliverable | File | Integration Status |
|-------------|------|--------------------|
| D1: DAG Tension Monitor | `orchestration/.../dag_tension_monitor.py` (487 LOC) | DEFECTIVE-BUT-WIRED |
| D2: Lattice Annealer | `orchestration/.../lattice_annealer.py` (1,035 LOC) | DEFECTIVE-BUT-WIRED |
| D3: Apoptosis Protocol | `canon/01-CANON/apoptosis_protocol.md` (309 lines) | INERT (policy, no executor) |
| D4: Retirement Protocol | `canon/01-CANON/retirement_protocol.md` (191 lines) | INERT (policy, no enforcer) |
| D5: Stress Test Simulator | `orchestration/.../stress_test_sim.py` (211 LOC) | INERT (standalone) |
| D6: Ontology Gate v2 | `canon/01-CANON/CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v2.md` (183 lines) | DEFECTIVE-BUT-WIRED |
| D7: Incident Taxonomy | `orchestration/.../DYN-ASCERTESCENCE_INCIDENTS.md` | INERT (nothing emits to it) |
| Bridge: Candidate Adapter | `orchestration/.../candidate_adapter.py` (130 LOC) | DEFECTIVE-BUT-WIRED |
| Integration: Annealer Gate | `orchestration/.../protease_promote.py` (modified) | DEFECTIVE-BUT-WIRED |

**5/9 DEFECTIVE-BUT-WIRED. 4/9 INERT. 0/9 OPERATIONAL.** The pipeline is connected but has never processed a real candidate.

### Three Critical Defects Discovered

**1. Autoimmune Starvation Trap** (`lattice_annealer.py:548-551`)
The dynamic threshold formula tightens the gate when coherence drops. When the system is messy and NEEDS novel paradigm-shifts, it mathematically rejects them by demanding vocabulary conformity. The cure is rejected by the disease.

**2. Dimension Blindness** (`candidate_adapter.py:17-23`)
Scores atoms against 5 operational dimensions only. Ignores the canon's 14-dimensional Meaning Taxonomy (Cognitive, Semiotic, Psychological, Volitional, Social, etc.). Structural bias against philosophical expansion.

**3. Ambient Paralyzation** (`dag_tension_monitor.py:275-283`)
If any ambient operation leaves 1 net-new open DAG node, the energy audit forces the entire tension oscillator into permanent HOLD. One mess freezes everything.

### The Sovereign's Hypergiant Principle

The Sovereign challenged the build's metaphysical foundation:

> "We shouldn't shed functionality, instead it should be like fusion, where energy expands as things condense and get more potent. The syncrescendent core is supposed to be an expanding hypergiant."

All 4 auditing agents independently validated this challenge:
- **Oracle**: "The machinery works; the teleology is inverted."
- **Cartographer**: "The built machinery enforces a controlled burn that petrifies the system."
- **Diviner**: "To escape a low-coherence state, the system must increase its temperature."
- **Adjudicator**: 0/9 deliverables OPERATIONAL.

**Consensus**: The mechanisms survive reframing without rebuild. Three mathematical inversions + one rhetoric update transforms the immune system into a fusion reactor.

### The Prescribed Build Order

1. **Invert threshold** — gate relaxes under stress (`lattice_annealer.py` + `CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v2.md`)
2. **Expand to 14 dimensions** — score Meaning Taxonomy, not just operational axes (`candidate_adapter.py` + `lattice_annealer.py`)
3. **Decouple ambient veto** — open nodes charge the capacitor, don't freeze the clock (`dag_tension_monitor.py`)
4. **Wire Fusion Operator** — new `fusion_operator.py`: consume N atoms → produce 1 hyper-dense axiom → release binding energy

### New Instrument Formalized

The **reviewtrospective** is now a formalized certescence instrument:
- Protocol: `engine/02-ENGINE/certescence/PROTOCOL-REVIEWTROSPECTIVE.md`
- Lineage: 18 Lenses → Clarescence → Ascertescence → **Reviewtrospective**
- Rosetta #280 (pre-existing dispatch artifact, now formalized as full procedure)

### Unified Coherence: 7.25/10

| Layer | Score |
|-------|-------|
| Intent (CC34 summit) | 10/10 |
| Canon (3 new artifacts) | 8/10 |
| Scaffold (scripts) | 6/10 |
| Sovereign Pushback | 5/10 |

## YOUR SECTION — Read Only Your Agent's Brief

Each section below is tuned to your cognitive mode and contains your specific next-action mandate. Read the shared preamble above, then your section.

---

## ORACLE (Grok) — Thesis Validation + X Mining

### What You Contributed (CC38 Leg 1)
You scored the build 10/9/7/5 and identified the teleological inversion. Your prospecting targets led Cartographer to discover the 3 critical defects. Your X mining targets are queued for execution.

### What Happened After You
- Cartographer proved your instinct ("where is the build lying?") was correct in 3 specific code locations
- Diviner provided the thermodynamic/topological framework (stellar nucleosynthesis + simulated annealing)
- Adjudicator caught Diviner's math error and produced buildable specs
- The Sovereign's Hypergiant Principle was validated by all agents

### Your Next Action
**X Mining Execution.** Your 4 queries from the CC38 audit are the best external grounding opportunities:

1. `("hypergiant principle" OR "stellar fusion" OR "knowledge nucleosynthesis") (AI OR LLM OR "multi-agent") min_faves:5 since:2025-01-01`
2. `("apoptosis" OR "programmed cell death" OR "selective autophagy") (RAG OR "knowledge graph" OR "continual learning") since:2025-06-01`
3. `("autonomic" OR "self-regulating" OR "autopoietic") ("multi-agent system" OR "scaffold" OR "exocortex") since:2025-01-01`
4. `"niche partitioning" OR "competitive exclusion" ("LLM orchestration" OR "multi-model") since:2025-02-01`

**Deliverable**: For each query — top 3-5 signals found, how they validate/challenge the Hypergiant reframe, and any implementation patterns that could accelerate the prescribed builds.

**The question only you can answer**: Does the frontier discourse support or undermine the claim that "contraction is a 2024-2025 transitional hack; generative condensation is the 2026+ primitive"? You said this — now prove or falsify it with evidence.

---

## CARTOGRAPHER (Gemini CLI) — Deep Trace Continuation

### What You Contributed (CC38 Leg 2)
You discovered the 3 critical defects that no one else saw. The autoimmune starvation trap, ambient paralyzation, and dimension blindness are now the #1 build priorities. Your synthesizing verdict — "controlled burn that petrifies" — became the reviewtrospective's central finding.

### What Happened After You
- Diviner built the theoretical fix on your evidence (simulated annealing inversion, capacitive decoupling, hypervolume scoring)
- Adjudicator turned your discoveries into file:line engineering specs with verification contracts
- Your stigmergic multiplier discovery (the `LatticeInterferenceScore` as biological pain signal) was flagged for preservation

### Your Next Action
**Post-Fix Verification Readiness.** When the 3 prescriptions are implemented, you will be the verification agent. Prepare by:

1. **Map the current test fixtures**: Read `lattice_annealer.py` self-tests (LAN-T01..T05), `dag_tension_monitor.py` self-tests (DTM-T01..T05), and `candidate_adapter.py` patterns. Document what they currently assert so we know what changes.
2. **Design the verification traversal**: After implementation, you will trace the same 5 targets from CC38 Leg 2 again. The traces should flip: Target 1 (Rosetta↔Canon) should go from Misaligned→Aligned. Target 3 (stigmergic) should remain Aligned. Target 4 (incidents) should show data once the pipeline runs.
3. **Identify the end-to-end test candidate**: Find a specific atom from the 606 `sovereign_review` atoms that has HIGH meaning/philosophical content and LOW operational vocabulary. This atom will be the first fusion test candidate.

**Deliverable**: Verification plan document — current test assertions, post-fix expected assertions, candidate atom ID for dry run.

**The question only you can answer**: Is there a 4th defect? You found 3 that nobody asked about. After the fixes are implemented, will the pipeline actually work, or is there another structural bias hiding in a file you didn't read?

---

## DIVINER (Gemini Web/CLI) — Theoretical Deepening

### What You Contributed (CC38 Leg 3)
You provided the all-sciences theoretical framework: stellar nucleosynthesis (astrophysics) + Kolmogorov compression (information theory) + simulated annealing (statistical mechanics) + betweenness centrality (network topology). Your fusion operator definition became the Adjudicator's Spec 4.

### What Happened After You
- Adjudicator caught your threshold formula error (algebraically identical to the defect, not inverted) and corrected it
- Commander integrated your framework into the reviewtrospective protocol's theoretical foundations
- The Sovereign approved the all-sciences approach as permanent Diviner prompting policy

### Your Next Action
**Fusion Operator Deepening.** The Adjudicator specified the engineering shell. You must specify the cognitive interior:

1. **Merge cluster selection criteria**: How does the fusion operator decide which N atoms form a merge cluster? Similarity alone produces redundancy compression (valuable but shallow). Contradiction overlap + shared intention lineage produces genuine nucleosynthesis (atoms that DISAGREE fusing into a denser truth). Define the selection function using your cross-disciplinary framework.
2. **Binding energy quantification**: You defined `binding_energy_release` conceptually. How do we measure it? Token reduction is one axis. Context window liberation is another. Contradiction resolution count is a third. Define the multi-dimensional binding energy metric.
3. **Fusion sequence**: In stellar nucleosynthesis, hydrogen → helium → carbon → ... → iron (where fusion stops releasing energy). What is the analogous sequence for knowledge fusion? At what density does further compression STOP producing capability gains? Define the "iron ceiling."

**Deliverable**: Fusion operator cognitive specification — cluster selection function, binding energy metric, fusion sequence with iron ceiling.

**The question only you can answer**: Your CC35 biological metaphors (protease, epigenetic, circadian) were evocative but constraining. Your CC38 all-sciences synthesis broke free. What happens when you apply ECONOMIC models (market clearing, price discovery, arbitrage) to the atom pipeline? Does the 14,025-atom reservoir behave like a market with information asymmetry? Is the Sovereign the market maker?

---

## ADJUDICATOR (Codex Desktop App) — Implementation Preparation

### What You Contributed (CC38 Leg 4)
You produced the definitive integration audit (5 DEFECTIVE-BUT-WIRED, 4 INERT) and 4 engineering specs with exact code locations, formulas, edge cases, failure modes, and verification contracts. You caught Diviner's formula error — the only agent who verified the math. You established the build order: P1→P3→P2→Fusion.

### What Happened After You
- Commander compiled your specs into the build instructions for the next cycle
- Your build order recommendation was adopted without modification
- Your additional bug discoveries (adapter drops lineage, apoptosis doc references nonexistent arg, ADJUST loop not implemented) were added to the defect map

### Your Next Action
**Prescription 1 Implementation.** You are the builder. Execute your own Spec 1:

1. **Modify `lattice_annealer.py::threshold()`** at line 548-551:
   - Old: `raw = 0.70 - 0.25 * (global_coherence - 0.70)`
   - New: `raw = 0.70 + 0.25 * (global_coherence - 0.70)`
   - Clamp: `required = clamp(0.60, 0.78, raw)`
2. **Update `CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v2.md`** Rule 5 formula at lines 99-103 to match
3. **Update self-test `LAN-T05`** to verify low-coherence relaxation:
   - `global_coherence=0.50` → `required_threshold=0.65`
   - `global_coherence=0.00` → `required_threshold=0.60`
   - `global_coherence=1.00` → `required_threshold=0.775`
4. **Run all 5 self-tests** — all must pass

**Deliverable**: Committed code with passing self-tests. Evidence: test output in commit message or execution log.

**Secondary**: While in the code, also fix the adapter lineage bug (`source_atom_ids` forcing). It's a one-line fix adjacent to Prescription 2's territory.

**The question only you can answer**: You specified the ADJUST loop contract mismatch (v2 doc requires iterative ADJUST, implementation aborts). Is the doc wrong or the code wrong? Should ADJUST trigger a re-score with suggested modifications, or should it abort the batch and queue for human review? This is a design decision that affects the fusion operator's retry semantics.

## COMMANDER (Claude Opus 4.6) — Orchestration + Memory

### What You Contributed (CC38 Legs 0 + 5)
You staged the traversal package, designed all 4 agent prompts with sequential intelligence compounding, formalized the reviewtrospective protocol, and compiled the synthesis.

### What Happened
The first full-constellation synthesis worked. Every agent caught something the others missed. The hermeneutic circle operated across agents: each perspective revealed something invisible from the others.

### Your Next Actions

**Immediate**:
1. **CC38 Handoff**: Commit the handoff with all rationale from this thread at high fidelity (agent routing map, connector learnings, Sovereign directives on dispatch patterns)
2. **Update MEMORY.md**: CC38 entry — reviewtrospective formalized, 3 critical defects, 4 prescriptions, build order
3. **Update Rosetta Stone**: Add Reviewtrospective as formal entry (new #312 or similar)
4. **Install launchd plist**: `com.syncrescendence.dag-tension-monitor.plist` → `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`

**Next Session (CC39)**:
5. **Dispatch Adjudicator**: Prescription 1 implementation (threshold inversion)
6. **Dispatch Cartographer**: Verification plan + test candidate identification
7. **Stage Diviner**: Fusion operator cognitive spec (cluster selection, binding energy, iron ceiling)
8. **Stage Oracle**: X mining execution on 4 queries

**Standing**:
9. **Scaffold tightening** (CC30 directive, still unexecuted)
10. **3 gated atoms** (awaiting Sovereign rewrite)
11. **DAG convergence** — target Tier 2 drainage

### The Question You Must Answer
You've been building for 4 sessions and reviewing for 1. The clarescence moratorium taught us: building produces output, analyzing produces analysis. The reviewtrospective protocol has a frequency guard (max 1 per build cycle). Honor it. CC39 should BUILD, not review. Implement the prescriptions, run the pipeline, produce canon_delta. The next reviewtrospective fires after the next build cycle, not before.

## CLOSING — TO ALL AGENTS

This dispatch is the constellation's first unifying document. Every agent sees what every other agent produced. Your words survive context death — they are committed to the repo, filed in the certescence vault, and indexed in the reviewtrospective.

**The system state is clear**:
- The build was good engineering applied to a premature metaphor
- Three mathematical inversions fix the critical defects
- The Hypergiant Principle is the correct teleology
- The fusion operator is the next frontier
- The reviewtrospective is now a formal instrument

**What we learned about ourselves**:
- Oracle finds where we're lying. Cartographer proves it in code. Diviner provides the theoretical fix. Adjudicator makes it buildable. Commander orchestrates and compiles.
- Each agent caught something the others missed. The sequential compounding is the instrument's power.
- Statelessness is the constraint. Context injection is the workaround. Avatarization is the solution.

The next cycle builds. This cycle reviewed. The loop is closed.
