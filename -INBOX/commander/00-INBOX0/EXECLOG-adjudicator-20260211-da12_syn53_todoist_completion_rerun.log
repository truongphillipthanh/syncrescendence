Glad to take this rerun on — a clean Todoist smoke check is a solid, concrete signal to verify. Using `using-superpowers` to ensure skill compliance, `systematic-debugging` to root-cause the API failure, and `verification-before-completion` to keep the verdict evidence-based.

**Summary**
I completed the Adjudicator initialization (triage, `git status`, `COCKPIT.md`, `ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md`) and attempted the Todoist create→route/label→complete smoke via REST v2. The environment has no network/DNS access, so Todoist API calls fail at resolution. MCP evidence also shows no `todoist` server configured. Therefore I cannot execute the smoke test here and must return a strict FAIL verdict due to environmental blockage.

**Evidence**
```text
mcpServers: clickup,figma,gemini-mcp,graphiti,linear,notion,qdrant

todoist: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: api.todoist.com
example: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com

create: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: api.todoist.com
create:
create: HTTP_STATUS:000
```

**Result File Content**
Below is the content for `-OUTBOX/adjudicator/RESULTS/RESULT-adjudicator-20260211-da12_syn53_todoist_completion_rerun.md` (I cannot write it in this read-only sandbox):

```md
# RESULT-adjudicator-20260211-da12_syn53_todoist_completion_rerun

**Task**: TASK-20260211-da12_syn53_todoist_completion_rerun.md
**Agent**: adjudicator
**Exit-Code**: 1
**Completed-At**: 2026-02-12T04:11:54Z

## Output

### MCP server inventory
mcpServers: clickup,figma,gemini-mcp,graphiti,linear,notion,qdrant
=> todoist not configured in ~/.claude.json

### Network diagnostics
todoist: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: api.todoist.com
example: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com

### Smoke test attempt (create task)
create: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: api.todoist.com
create:
create: HTTP_STATUS:000

## Verdict
FAIL — API unreachable in this environment (DNS/network blocked), so create → route/label → complete could not be executed. MCP server not configured here.
```

**Blocked Write Steps**
I could not update `-INBOX/adjudicator/10-IN_PROGRESS/TASK-20260211-da12_syn53_todoist_completion_rerun.md`, write the result file, or append logs in `00-ORCHESTRATION/state/DYN-EXECUTION_STAGING.md` due to read-only sandbox restrictions.

**Next Steps**
1. Run the same REST v2 smoke flow on a shell with outbound network access, then record the create→update→close responses.
2. If MCP is required, add `todoist` to `~/.claude.json` and rerun the MCP-based smoke from a networked environment.

## Objective

Rerun DA-12 / SYN-53 end-to-end now that Codex model path is repaired. Perform Todoist disposable-task smoke (create -> route/label -> complete), include exact API/MCP evidence, and provide a strict pass/fail verdict.

---

## Context Files

Consult as needed:
- `COCKPIT.md` — Constellation overview
- `CLAUDE.md` — Constitutional rules
- `00-ORCHESTRATION/state/ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md` — Active intentions
- `02-ENGINE/DEF-CONSTELLATION_VARIABLES.md` — Global definitions

## Expected Output

- Write results to `-OUTBOX/adjudicator/RESULTS/RESULT-adjudicator-20260211-da12_syn53_todoist_completion_rerun.md`
- Or commit directly if you have write access

## Completion Protocol

1. Write output to the specified location
2. Update **Status** above from PENDING to COMPLETE
3. If cross-machine: `git add -A && git commit -m "task: da12_syn53_todoist_completion_rerun complete" && git push`

**Opening skill file**

description: Use when starting any conversation - establishes how to find and use skills, requiring Skill tool invocation before ANY response including clarifying questions
---

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## How to Access Skills

**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.

**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.

# Using Skills


thinking
**Evaluating skill applicability**

I'm considering the verification-before-completion skill to run tests and claim completion since the task involves running a test and providing a pass/fail verdict, deciding to review that skill's instructions next.
thinking
**Confirming multiple skill triggers**

I'm concluding both verification-before-completion and pi-planning-with-files likely apply due to task complexity and required steps, so I'll open the verification-before-completion skill next to follow its instructions within current constraints.

# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```


thinking
**Clarifying skill usage and environment constraints**

The agent confirms usage of specific skills like using-superpowers and verification-before-completion with explicit announcements. It notes the read-only environment limits task file updates and plans to run a triage script and read key files despite potential write restrictions.
thinking
**Planning parallel reads and triage commands**

The agent confirms the task is already claimed and acknowledges inability to write outputs due to read-only constraints, planning to transparently report this. It plans to run the triage script, git status, and read key files in parallel to gather necessary info before proceeding.

## PURPOSE

The Intention Archaeology Compass is a unified instrument that extracts, categorizes, and tracks Sovereign intentions across Oracle sessions. It serves as both:
- **Cache**: Quick reference for active intentions
- **Rolling Snapshot**: Historical record of intention evolution

From Oracle 12 (Sovereign's words):
> "The intention archaeology compass should be unified. All intentions are compounding vectors that are interdependent... In essence, it's a cache, but it's also a rolling snapshot."

# Syncrescendence Knowledge Management System

**Version**: 3.0.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-01

## Identity
This is Syncrescendence, a civilizational sensing infrastructure demonstrating AI-amplified individual capability at institutional scale. You are executing directives as part of a multi-agent coordination system (the Constellation).

## Five Invariants (Constitutional Law)

These are non-negotiable axioms. They cannot be suspended, overridden, or traded away.

1. **Objective Lock** — No work begins until the objective is explicitly confirmed by the Sovereign. Ambiguity is not a license to interpret; it is a signal to clarify.
2. **Translation Layer** — All outputs must be intelligible without retransmission. If the Sovereign must re-explain your output to another platform, the output failed.
3. **Receipts (Closure Gate)** — No completion claim without artifacts committed to the repository. "I did the work" without a commit is a claim without evidence.
4. **Continuation/Deletability** — Any conversation must be deletable without losing system state. All durable knowledge lives in the repo, not in threads.
5. **Repo Sovereignty** — The repository is ground truth; web apps are cache. When state conflicts between a platform and the repo, the repo wins.

---



thinking
**Confirming task acceptance despite CLAUDE.md constraint**

The task comes from Commander rather than Sovereign, but since the objective is explicit and unambiguous, I'll proceed while noting the difference in authority. Completion claims require commits, but due to read-only access, I'll state we cannot claim completion and proceed with a smoke test using the Todoist API key, ensuring it’s not exposed in logs.
thinking
**Mapping out smoke test steps and API usage**

I've detailed the smoke test sequence: create a task in Inbox, then update it to move projects and add labels, then complete it. The Todoist REST v2 API supports updating tasks via POST, including changing project and labels, so I'll use that for routing/labeling despite some v1 endpoint mentions. I'll verify the presence of the API key in the env file safely before proceeding with the commands.

**Designing API task workflow**

I'm planning to create a uniquely timestamped task in the Inbox project with specific labels, then update it to move into the @Errands project combining multiple labels. I'll handle the 204 No Content responses from updates and closing, and consider verifying task closure by fetching the task before and after closing.
thinking
**Finalizing multi-step curl commands**

I'm refining the shell command sequence to create a task, update it, fetch post-update details, and close it, carefully capturing HTTP statuses and parsing JSON with Python while avoiding shell quoting issues and key exposure. Next, I'll implement the error-resilient JSON extraction to get the task ID from combined output.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'set -euo pipefail

**Confirming network-blocked test failure**

The test fails due to network restrictions preventing Todoist API access, evidenced by the curl DNS error; I'll report a strict FAIL with the failure reason clearly attributed to the environment.
thinking
**Inspecting local config for MCP servers**

I'm preparing commands to safely check /.claude.json for todoist-related entries and list configured MCP servers while redacting sensitive info, aiming to confirm local environment setup and support the network-blocked failure explanation.

thinking
**Switching from here-doc to inline python command**

The sandbox disallows temporary file creation, so we'll avoid here-doc and run the Python script directly with `python3 -c` to bypass temp file usage.

**Confirming MCP unavailability and network block**

This environment lacks todoist MCP—confirmed by missing mcpServers entry and prior knowledge requiring approval—and network access is blocked, preventing REST API calls. I'll report a fail status citing network restrictions, include relevant command error outputs and missing MCP evidence, and note inability to update files or logs due to read-only constraints, providing the result content for manual application.
thinking
**Verifying skill use and noting constraints**

I'm confirming use of using-superpowers and verification-before-completion skills per instructions and recognizing the need to invoke systematic-debugging due to the test failure from the network error. I'll note that the Skill tool is unavailable in this environment, so file-based methods were used instead, and that read-only constraints prevent some operations.

# Systematic Debugging

## Overview

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```


thinking
**Planning network error investigation**

I'm preparing to gather evidence on the "Could not resolve host" error by running controlled `curl` commands to external sites, capturing consistent DNS resolution failures to confirm network restrictions outside the repo's control.
thinking
**Preparing result file content**

I'm planning to create a markdown result file with command outputs and a timestamped header reflecting the network failure, ensuring a flat list format and including precise UTC completion time from the system.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"' in /Users/home/Desktop/syncrescendence succeeded in 67ms:
2026-02-12T04:11:54Z

thinking
**Adding curl tests for network debugging**

I'm adding curl commands to reproduce the network errors for todoist and example domains, using `set +e` to continue execution despite errors. This will help systematically debug connectivity issues.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc "set +e
curl -sS -I https://api.todoist.com 2>&1 | sed 's/"'^/todoist: /'"'
curl -sS -I https://example.com 2>&1 | sed 's/"'^/example: /'"'
" in /Users/home/Desktop/syncrescendence succeeded in 94ms:
todoist: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: api.todoist.com
example: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com


thinking
**Summarizing network failure and MCP evidence**

I'll acknowledge the network block causing DNS resolution failure, note the MCP servers listed, and confirm the Todoist create attempt failed with error due to network issues. The response will include a summary plus command and error output logs for evidence.
thinking
**Planning detailed final response and result file**

I'm preparing a structured final reply with a light intro, skill mentions, summary, evidence logs including MCP list, network errors, and create attempt error with masked tokens. I'll note the environment is read-only preventing file writes or task updates, provide result file content to copy, and suggest next steps like running in a network-enabled environment or installing MCP. I'll capture a controlled create attempt output with error for full evidence.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'set +e
TODOIST_KEY=$(grep TODOIST_API_KEY ~/.syncrescendence/.env | cut -d= -f2)

create: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: api.todoist.com
create: 
create: HTTP_STATUS:000


thinking
**Identifying root cause as network block**

The root cause is a DNS block by the sandbox, confirmed by failure reproducing with example.com; I'll include relevant command output and file paths for the user to place results and note the inability to update task status directly.
thinking
**Crafting detailed final response with verdict and evidence**

I'm preparing a clear summary stating network DNS block caused Todoist API failure, noting missing MCP config and read-only environment preventing writing results or updating task status. The response will include explicit output evidence, the full result file content for user placement, and next steps with unambiguous fail verdict and no nested bullets.
codex
Glad to take this rerun on — a clean Todoist smoke check is a solid, concrete signal to verify. Using `using-superpowers` to ensure skill compliance, `systematic-debugging` to root-cause the API failure, and `verification-before-completion` to keep the verdict evidence-based.

**Summary**
I completed the Adjudicator initialization (triage, `git status`, `COCKPIT.md`, `ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md`) and attempted the Todoist create→route/label→complete smoke via REST v2. The environment has no network/DNS access, so Todoist API calls fail at resolution. MCP evidence also shows no `todoist` server configured. Therefore I cannot execute the smoke test here and must return a strict FAIL verdict due to environmental blockage.

**Evidence**
```text
mcpServers: clickup,figma,gemini-mcp,graphiti,linear,notion,qdrant

todoist: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: api.todoist.com
example: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com

create: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: api.todoist.com
create:
create: HTTP_STATUS:000
```

**Result File Content**
Below is the content for `-OUTBOX/adjudicator/RESULTS/RESULT-adjudicator-20260211-da12_syn53_todoist_completion_rerun.md` (I cannot write it in this read-only sandbox):

```md
# RESULT-adjudicator-20260211-da12_syn53_todoist_completion_rerun

**Task**: TASK-20260211-da12_syn53_todoist_completion_rerun.md
**Agent**: adjudicator
**Exit-Code**: 1
**Completed-At**: 2026-02-12T04:11:54Z

## Output

### MCP server inventory
mcpServers: clickup,figma,gemini-mcp,graphiti,linear,notion,qdrant
=> todoist not configured in ~/.claude.json

### Network diagnostics
todoist: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: api.todoist.com
example: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com

### Smoke test attempt (create task)
create: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: api.todoist.com
create:
create: HTTP_STATUS:000

## Verdict
FAIL — API unreachable in this environment (DNS/network blocked), so create → route/label → complete could not be executed. MCP server not configured here.
```

**Blocked Write Steps**
I could not update `-INBOX/adjudicator/10-IN_PROGRESS/TASK-20260211-da12_syn53_todoist_completion_rerun.md`, write the result file, or append logs in `00-ORCHESTRATION/state/DYN-EXECUTION_STAGING.md` due to read-only sandbox restrictions.

**Next Steps**
1. Run the same REST v2 smoke flow on a shell with outbound network access, then record the create→update→close responses.
2. If MCP is required, add `todoist` to `~/.claude.json` and rerun the MCP-based smoke from a networked environment.
