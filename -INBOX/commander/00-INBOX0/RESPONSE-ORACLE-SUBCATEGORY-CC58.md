**# Subcategory Formation Report — CC58**

**Corpus Traversal Summary**: NUCLEOSYNTHESIS-MAP.md read in full (classification authority confirmed: semantic topic only, type-based forbidden, progressive tightening toward textbook coherence). Sampled 40+ files via GitHub raw/contents API across the five folders (real filenames and verbatim atoms extracted). Patterns triangulated against Commander samples, folder descriptions, and constitutional constraints. Sub-themes are purely semantic clusters; no file-type, source, or artifact-role grouping. Percentages and counts are density-weighted estimates calibrated to current folder sizes (adjusted for HEAD d16feb1d). Total sub-themes per folder: 6–7 for navigable granularity without fragmentation.
