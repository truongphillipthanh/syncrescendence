## Actions Taken

1. **SYN-22**: Moved from In Progress → Done (CANON operational status audit complete — 79/79 files, CANON-31150 v4.0 regenerated)
2. **SYN-30**: Design complete (ARCH-LINEAR_SYNC_PROTOCOL.md committed at 196dfe7). Moved to In Progress.
3. **SYN-16**: Acknowledged stale. SYN-30 protocol design partially addresses this. Will advance when Phase 2 sync automation begins.
4. **SYN-24**: P0-Critical acknowledged — requires Sovereign action (Mastery email setup). Cannot be autonomous.
5. **Backlog IMPL-A items (SYN-8/9/10/11/14/15)**: Review deferred to IMPL-MAP status audit (in progress).
6. **PM onboarding cluster (SYN-51-55, 59)**: Sovereign-gated. Framework created (SYN-58). Methodology research complete.
