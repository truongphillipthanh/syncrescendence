# Corpus Insight Report — 2026-02-13

**Generated by**: claudecron/corpus-insight
**Status**: PENDING

## Activity Summary
- Commits (last 24h): 67
- Files modified (last 24h): 167
- Active intentions: ~32 (4 urgent, 6 sprint, 13 session-16, 6 pre-oracle active, 3 backlog-active)

## Velocity Assessment

**High velocity, infrastructure-heavy.** The last 24h saw 67 commits — an exceptionally active day dominated by three workstreams:

1. **Skills Pipeline (INT-1102 adjacent)**: Major feat — 9 white-label skill wrappers, skill registry (246 skills), pipeline DAG edges, WatchPaths launchd sync. This is real infrastructure that accelerates future work.
2. **Ontology (INT-MI19)**: 295 Rosetta Bridge relations ingested into strategic_relationships. Ontology continues to compound.
3. **Cross-Agent Ops**: Psyche completed 6 task claims (Cartographer plist fix, Adjudicator model update). Ajna synced ~20 times. Multi-agent coordination is functioning.

**Stalled intentions**:
- **INT-1201** (revenue/sustainability): No commits or ledger entries related to revenue generation. Still marked "failed" since Jan 31. No reset target set.
- **INT-1612** (Begin ALL automations): Partial — launchd plists created but Hazel, Make/Zapier, webhook bridges, n8n remain untouched.
- **INT-1601** (Syncrescript): No activity. Zero commits referencing Syncrescript or Rails conventions.
- **INT-1604** (Web app memory audit): No activity.
- **INT-1608/1609** (Apple Notes + YouTube/X extraction): No activity.

## Orphaned Work

- **`findings.md`**, **`progress.md`**, **`task_plan.md`** — staged files in repo root with no clear intention link. Likely working artifacts from a session that weren't cleaned up.
- **17+ `Untitled*.md` files** in `-INBOX/commander/RECEIPTS/cli_logs/` — unnamed session logs accumulating without triage.
- **`02-ENGINE/SURVEY-AI_ECOSYSTEM_SURVEY.md`** — new file, likely Cartographer output, not linked to any intention or ledger entry.
- **`.gemini/commands/initialize.md`** — modified but no corresponding intention.

## Recommendations

1. **Reset INT-1201 (revenue)**: This is the highest-priority stalled intention. The Sovereign needs to set a new target date — it's been marked "failed" for 13 days with no replacement goal. Surface this in the next Oracle session.

2. **Clean repo root artifacts**: `findings.md`, `progress.md`, `task_plan.md` are orphaned working files. Either integrate their content into appropriate locations or delete them. They violate the flat-principle naming convention (no prefix).

3. **Triage Untitled cli_logs**: 17+ unnamed files in RECEIPTS/cli_logs/ are growing unbounded. Run a digest pass — extract any valuable content into execution history, then archive or delete the originals.
