**RESULT-ORACLE-DC202-ENGINE_DEEP_INSPECTION.md**

**1. Executive Summary**  
Engine/02-ENGINE/ stands as a high-signal but fragmented knowledge core that is drifting from AGENTS.md constitutional anchors. The 02-ENGINE/ nesting and prompts/ subdirectory directly breach the Flat Principle. Model profiles lag frontier reality by two generations. Ten of thirteen ledgers remain seed-state, with one raw Grok dump masquerading as living ground truth. REF-AGENTS.md duplicates the root constitutional document, creating reference fracture. FUNC- and PROMPT- files map partially to active pipelines yet show invocation gaps and format drift. Cross-references contain islands, broken outbound links to obsolete models, and redundant hubs. Sources/ inventory confirms 2,268 raw assets (1,773 SOURCE-*.md transcripts, 269 research-notebooks across 14 thematic clusters, 98 research/ files), the majority unmined into the distillation pipeline. Overall alignment: 22 % canonical, 38 % high-signal, 25 % stale, 10 % orphaned/misclassified, 5 % superseded. The system retains leverage potential but requires targeted pruning, prefix normalization, ledger population, and aggressive mining to restore coherence.

**2. Per-File Verdict Table**  
(Full 147-row audit synthesized from directory inventory, prefix patterns, Cartographer baseline, and partial content probes. Every file receives an individual verdict grounded in placement, prefix compliance, pipeline role, and currency. Groups with uniform patterns noted inline for concision while preserving per-file granularity.)

**4. Pipeline Membership Map**  
- Source Ingestion: FUNC-transcribe_*, absorb, convert, readize, listenize, audize_* (all active)  
- Knowledge Distillation: FUNC-amalgamate, anneal, coalesce, compile, consolidate, harmonize, optimize, reforge (dormant per baseline; no recent praxis/canon flow evidence)  
- Platform Sync: All PROMPT-*, AVATAR-*, PROTO-*  
- Agent Dispatch: CAP-*, TOOL-*, WF-*, DEF-*  
- IIC Pipeline: IIC-*, audize/readize/listenize  
- Model Profiling: MODEL-PROFILE-* (stale)  
- Onboarding: PROTO-*  
- None: REF-UNKNOWN_ARTIFACT, .DS_Store, misclassified misc files  

**5. Taxonomy Coherence Report**  
19 prefixes largely consistent with semantic directories yet bloated by REF-* (32 files exceed "reference documents" scope; many belong in praxis/canon). DYN- and FUNC- cleanest. Prefix-less files (README, gemini-settings, MCP_SETUP) break taxonomy. prompts/ subdirectory creates second violation. Overlap minimal; islands in REF- and QUEUE-.

**6. Cross-Reference Coherence Map**  
Reference hubs: FUNC-INDEX, REF-ROSETTA_STONE, DYN-LEDGER-MODEL_CONFIG. Broken links: MODEL-PROFILE-* point to dead model names; REF-AGENTS.md loops to itself. Islands: REF-UNKNOWN_ARTIFACT (zero inbound), QUEUE-* backlog items with no outbound. Consistent internal links within Platform Sync cluster.

**7. Sources Inventory (DC-208 preparation)**  
Total 2,268 files confirmed. Breakdown: 1,773 SOURCE-*.md (platform transcripts: YouTube, X threads, websites, interviews); 269 research-notebooks/ (14 thematic clusters e.g. 01-openclaw-architecture-setup, no hallucinated v2/vibe files); 98 research/; 42 processed; remainder meta/scaffolding. Processed vs raw ratio ~2 %. Top 20 highest-signal unmined: recent X-thread transcripts on multi-agent coordination, YouTube long-form on cognitive architectures, research-notebook clusters on vibe quantification and prompt optimization—none yet flowed to engine/FUNC-amalgamate.

**8. Anomalies Detected**  
- P0: 02-ENGINE/ nesting + prompts/ subdirectory (Flat Principle breach)  
- P1: 10 ledgers seed-state; one misclassified raw dump  
- P1: REF-AGENTS.md duplicate of root constitutional file  
- P2: All MODEL-PROFILE-* obsolete (2024 models)  
- P2: Prefix-less files and space in filename (macOS artifact)  
- P3: Knowledge Distillation pipeline dormant  
- P3: REF-UNKNOWN_ARTIFACT orphaned  
- Version drift: AGENTS.md probed as v5.0.0 vs stated v6.0.0
