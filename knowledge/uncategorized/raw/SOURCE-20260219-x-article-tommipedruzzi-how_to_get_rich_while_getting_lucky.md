# How to Get Rich (While Getting Lucky)
Naval Ravikant changed how a generation thinks about money. One tweetstorm. Millions of people. The ideas hit like a freight train.
But he left something on the table. And it's worth picking up.
## The Tweetstorm That Rewired Brains
In 2018, Naval Ravikant posted a tweetstorm titled "How to Get Rich (without getting lucky)."
(Description: Embedded X post showing Naval's verified account (@naval) with the text "How to Get Rich (without getting lucky):")
He also talked about it on a podcast with Nivi exploring the core idea of that tweetstorm.
It spread everywhere.
Doctors read it. Engineers in Ohio shared it. College students printed it out and taped it to their dorm room walls.
It touched something real in people who were tired of vague, motivational advice and hungry for a framework that actually made sense.
The core idea was that wealth isn't luck... It's something you build through specific knowledge, accountability, leverage, and judgement.
He was right, but there's a piece of that framework Naval breezed past.
He mentioned it, then moved on quickly.
In this article, I'm going to slow down and live inside that piece… because for us, it's the most actionable part of the whole framework.
## The Four Types of Luck
Naval drew from a framework that investor Marc Andreessen wrote about on his blog years ago.
The original ideas trace back further, to a book called *Chase, Chance, and Creativity* by neurosurgeon James Austin.
The framework says luck isn't one thing. It comes in four flavors:
**Type 1: Blind Luck.**
A meteor lands in your backyard and it's made of gold.
You did nothing. It just happened.
This is fate.
You can't manufacture it.
**Type 2: Luck from Hustling.**
You move fast.
You try things.
You stir the pot so hard that luck has no choice but to splash on you.
Fortune favors the bold.
**Type 3: Luck from Preparation.**
You go so deep into a field that you spot opportunities others walk past.
You see the door nobody else notices because you trained your eyes to look for it.
Chance favors the prepared mind.
**Type 4: Luck from Unique Character.**
You build such a specific reputation that luck seeks *you out*.
The treasure hunters come to you. The deals find you. Your character becomes your destiny.
Naval acknowledged all four. Then he sprinted toward Type 4 and spent the rest of the podcast unpacking it.
He's not wrong... Type 4 is powerful. Warren Buffett operates there. It's where the biggest rewards live.
But here's the truth most people skip over:
**Type 4 takes years. Sometimes decades.**
You can't build a legendary reputation in a weekend. You can't become Warren Buffett by next Friday.
Types 2 and 3, though? You can start those today. Right now. Before you finish reading this article.
That's what we're going to build together.
## Type 2: Luck from Hustling | The Art of Stirring the Pot
Naval described Type 2 luck simply:
*When you move a lot, things happen.*
Think of it like a fishing net. A fisherman who drops one small net in one spot catches what happens to swim by. But a fisherman who spreads ten nets across a wide stretch of water? Luck has ten times more chances to swim into his hands.
(Description: Line drawing showing a minimalist stick figure standing on a platform on the left, holding a single fishing line extending toward a circle on the right representing a fish or catch point. Above are depicted multiple fishing nets arranged across water, illustrating the concept of expanded surface area for luck.)
OR picture yourself as a ninja in training. You're standing in front of a dart board with a handful of shurikens. Throw one shuriken and your odds to hit the bullseye is slim. But throw 100 shurikens? Your odds increased.
(Description: Line drawing split into two scenes: left shows a ninja figure throwing a single shuriken at a target, center shows a traditional archery/dartboard target with concentric circles, right shows the same ninja throwing multiple shurikens toward the target with numerous projectiles in flight illustrating increased attempts.)
This isn't about working yourself into the ground. It's about *increasing your surface area for luck*.
Most people picture hustling as grinding 80-hour weeks, answering emails at midnight, and running on four hours of sleep. That's not what this means.
Hustling for luck means *taking more shots*.
Think about it this way...
A photographer who takes 1,000 photos in a month will capture more stunning images than one who takes 10... not because they're more talented, but because they gave luck more chances to show up.
A salesperson who makes 50 calls a week will land more deals than one who makes 10... not because they're more persuasive, but because they created more surface area.
In my field... a person who publishes 3 books every week will find a big hit faster than a publisher who publishes only once a month... not because he's smarter, but because he shipped more often.
When I say I've made $3M selling eBooks on Amazon, many think I'm exaggerating, but then I say I've published 1500 eBooks and they go "HOW?"
**Quantity creates the conditions for quality luck to strike.**
### Motion Compounds in Unexpected Ways
Here's something that rarely gets said about hustling:
*The connections you make while moving fast are often worth more than the thing you were originally moving toward.*
Naval himself is a perfect example...
He posted videos online. He ran podcasts. He dropped tweetstorms. None of those individual things were "the plan." But the motion of putting ideas out into the world created a network, a reputation, and opportunities he couldn't have predicted.
When you move; when you write the cold email, launch the side project, attend the event, publish the essay... you generate what physicists call *entropy*.
You increase the number of possible states the world can fall into.
More possible states means more chances for a lucky one to land in your lap.
The people who get "randomly" lucky are usually the people who created 10 times more chances than everyone else.
### How to Apply Type 2 Luck Starting Now:
Pick one area of your life... career, creative work, relationships, investing, and ask: **how do I double my shot count?**
Not double your hours. Double your *attempts*.
If you're a developer, ship a small project every two weeks instead of hoarding one massive project for a year.
If you're in sales, add 10 more outreach messages to your weekly routine.
OR if you're a publisher like me, publish more books in multiple different niches.
The goal isn't perfection. The goal is momentum.
**Momentum manufactures luck.**
## Type 3: Luck from Preparation | The Luck That Only You Can See
This is where things get genuinely interesting.
Type 3 luck doesn't come to everyone. It only comes to people who have put in enough work in a specific area that they can see what others are blind to.
Naval described it this way:
*If you're skilled in a field, you notice when a lucky break happens in that field. Other people don't notice it. They walk right past it. But you see it because your training built the right eyes.*
This isn't just about working hard. It's about going deep.
*Narrowing... not broadening.*
### The Prepared Mind Sees Doors in Walls
Imagine a garage sale that a hundred people walk through on a Saturday morning. Most people see junk. But the person who has spent three years studying antiques spots a dusty lamp in the corner priced at $5. They recognize the maker's mark on the base. That lamp sells at auction for $800. Everyone says they got lucky. They weren't lucky. They were prepared.
Not the best of examples but you got the point.
They didn't get lucky. They got *prepared*.
This happens constantly in the real world:
A doctor who has studied a rare disease for years reads a case file that every other doctor dismissed. She spots a pattern. She saves the patient. Lucky? No. Prepared.
A kid who has spent years collecting sneakers walks into a thrift store. He spots a beat-up pair of shoes on the bottom shelf priced at $8. Everyone else walked past them all day. He picks them up, flips them over, and recognizes the sole pattern instantly. They're a rare 1985 Nike collab worth $600. Lucky? No. Prepared.
A software engineer who has spent years studying distributed systems reads a job posting that everyone else ignored because the problem sounded too hard. She knows exactly how to solve it. She gets the role. Lucky? No. Prepared.
**Preparation converts invisible opportunities into visible ones. That's the mechanism. That's the magic.**
But you'll see most people fail...
Because they prepare broadly instead of deeply.
They read five books on investing, three books on marketing, two books on productivity, and one book on machine learning.
They feel knowledgeable. They feel ready.
But shallow preparation doesn't build the pattern recognition needed for Type 3 luck. It builds the *illusion* of preparation.
Naval put it plainly: if you're not 100% into something, someone who is will outperform you enormously, not by a little, but by a lot.
The leverage that comes from deep knowledge is enormous. Two people using the same tools, but with very different depths of understanding, will produce results that look like they're from different species.
Deep preparation means you go all the way down.
You read the original sources, not the summaries. You do the work, not just study the work. You spend enough time in a domain that you start to feel its texture, the way things move, the patterns that repeat, the moments that feel off.
At that depth, luck starts showing up differently for you than it does for everyone else.
### How to Build Preparation That Attracts Luck:
Choose one domain.
Not five.
One.
Go deep enough that you can have a conversation with the best practitioners in that field and hold your own. Read what they read. Go back to the original sources. Do the work they do, even if it's just on nights and weekends.
Then stay alert.
The prepared mind doesn't just absorb information... it scans for *anomalies*. Things that don't fit the pattern. Gaps that shouldn't be there. Doors in walls.
Write down the things that seem strange in your field. The things other people shrug at. Those strange things are where Type 3 luck hides.
## Type 4: The Long Game (And Why It's Still Worth Playing)
We promised not to leave Type 4 on the floor.
Naval was right to emphasize it. It deserves utmost respect.
Type 4 luck is when your reputation and character become so specific, so well-known, and so distinctive, that luck starts routing itself through you.
Naval's example:
If you're the world's best deep-sea diver, and someone finds a sunken treasure ship, they come to you. Their luck becomes your luck, because you positioned yourself to receive it.
Warren Buffett gets offered deals no one else sees. Not because he's lucky. Because 60 years of demonstrated judgment built a gravitational field that pulls opportunities to him.
(Description: Portrait illustration of Warren Buffett smiling, wearing glasses and a dark suit with purple tie, seated in a leather chair in front of a bookshelf filled with vintage book spines, with window light coming from the right side. The illustration captures his characteristic warm expression and intellectual bearing.)
The difference between Type 4 and the others is time.
Types 2 and 3 can work within months. Type 4 is a decade-long project, sometimes longer.
Here's what most readers overlook when they hear Naval explain this:
**Types 2 and 3 are how you build toward Type 4.**
Type 2 and 3 are processes. The 4th is the result of those processes over a long period of time.
The hustle of Type 2 gets you in rooms you wouldn't otherwise enter.
Those rooms give you the raw material for deep preparation: Type 3.
And that deep preparation, done long enough, with enough accountability and visibility, slowly crystallizes into a reputation: Type 4.
**The path runs through the middle two.**
**It always has.**
## The Hierarchy of Luck | A Framework to Carry With You
Here is a clean way to think about where you are and what to do next:
**Early in your journey?**
Focus almost entirely on Type 2.
Move. Take shots. Create surface area.
The biggest mistake early on is waiting for the perfect moment.
There is no perfect moment.
There is only motion and stillness.
Choose motion.
**A few years in, with a direction emerging?**
Shift energy toward Type 3.
Go deep into your domain. Build pattern recognition. Stop reading broadly and start reading deeply.
Let the shallow stuff go.
**A decade in, with a body of work and a track record?**
Type 4 starts happening to you, almost without trying.
You don't manufacture it. It's the exhaust of the first two types.
Most people never get to Type 4 because they skip Types 2 and 3.
They wait for Type 1 — blind luck, and wonder why it never comes. Or they hear about Type 4 and try to build a reputation before they've done the work that creates one.
**The sequence matters.**
**Respect it.**
## What to Do When You Finish Reading This
A practical thing to carry with you today... One action for each type of luck you can actually control:
**For Type 2:** Write down three things you've been thinking about doing but haven't started. Pick one. Do the first step today. Not tomorrow. Today. Send the email. Publish the post. Make the call. The point isn't the outcome, the point is the motion.
**For Type 3:** Ask yourself honestly: what is the one field where, if you went truly deep, you would be among the best? Not famous, just deep. Pick that field. Find the most important original book in it. Start reading it this week. Not a summary. The book.
**For Type 4:** Start doing both of the above visibly. Not for attention, but for accountability. A public record of your work, your thinking, and your failures is the seed of a reputation. Plant it.
The world rewards people who move, people who prepare, and people who build character over time.
Naval showed us the destination. These are the roads that get you there.
You don't have to wait for luck.
You can start building the conditions for it right now.
Because if you show up every day, the luck won't have a choice. Thanks for reading. RT this post if you liked it & follow me for more.
