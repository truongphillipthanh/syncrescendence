## Description (no transcript available)

Two major transactions reshaped early 2026 AI competition: Meta's acquisition of Manus for about $2 billion and Nvidia's $20 billion licensing deal with Groq. Meta's purchase wagers on autonomous general-purpose agents and distribution as the new moat while exposing geopolitical dynamics around Chinese-founded startups. Nvidia's Groq deal signals a shift toward specialized low-latency inference chips, potentially altering hardware economics and accelerating training demand.
