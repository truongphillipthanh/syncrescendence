## Description (no transcript available)

What does it really mean to be a genius? Is it just high intelligence, or something deeper—like seeing the world in a way others can’t? In this video, I explore the nature of genius through the ideas of Arthur Schopenhauer, Emerson, William James, and others who tried to capture its essence.

We’ll talk about why true genius is less about IQ or talent and more about vision—perceiving truths that remain invisible to most. We’ll also look at the dangers of over-reading, why many geniuses feel misunderstood or even alienated, and the ethical responsibility that comes with such insight.

From Schopenhauer’s warning about drowning in second-hand ideas, to Emerson’s famous line that “to be great is to be misunderstood,” this is a journey into the light and loneliness of genius. In an age of constant noise and distraction, what does it mean to think independently, to live as a genius today?

If you’ve ever felt out of place, noticed connections others miss, or carried ideas that seemed too strange for ordinary conversations—this video is for you.
