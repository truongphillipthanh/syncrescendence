________________________
What's really happening with AI coding tools after December's convergence? The common story is that better models mean incremental improvement—but the reality is more complicated when the CEO of OpenAI admits he still hasn't changed how he works.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why a capability overhang is widening between what AI can do and what most people are doing with it:

 • Why three frontier model releases in six days created a phase transition
 • How a simple bash loop called Ralph outperformed elaborate agent frameworks
 • What Claude Code's task system means for parallel autonomous work
 • Where the real skill shift lands: from implementation to specification and review

For builders and operators navigating 2026, the temporary arbitrage is real—those who close the overhang first gain a massive edge that compounds daily.
