What’s really happening inside AI fluency and why most people misjudge their own skill?
The common story is that “AI competency” means knowing one tool — but the reality is far more multi-dimensional, and I built a tool to fix it.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on leveling up real AI fluency:
• Why strategy, prompting, and workflow design matter beyond any single model
• How AI Cred measures all five pillars of LLM capability
• What multi-model work demands as GPT-5.1, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 evolve
• Where honest evaluation and ethics shape trustworthy AI use

Real AI work blends judgment, integration, and critical evaluation — and teams that measure across all five pillars make better decisions, faster.
