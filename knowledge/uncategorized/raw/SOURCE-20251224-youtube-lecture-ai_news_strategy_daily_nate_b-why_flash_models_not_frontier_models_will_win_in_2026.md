What's really happening with AI in 2026 as the hype era ends?
The common story is that AI will keep dazzling us with flashy demos and benchmarks — but the reality is more complicated.
In this video, I share the inside scoop on why 2026 marks AI's shift from clever releases to systems that actually work:
- Why protocols and constraints now matter more than prompting alone
- How agentic workflows reduce entropy when LLMs are narrowly scoped
- What dual fluency means for AI careers and talent repricing
- Where robotics and generative UI unlock post-ChatGPT software futures

Chapters:
0:00 - Introduction: AI moving from hype to reality 
0:45 - The burst of the AI hype bubble in 2025 
1:30 - Seeing AI capabilities in high definition 
2:26 - The emerging AI talent ecosystem 
3:30 - Bet 1: Protocols matter more than prompting 
4:47 - Bet 2: Taking constraints seriously 
6:17 - Bet 3: Understanding where AI fits in workflows 
8:10 - Bet 4: LLMs as entropy reducers 
10:20 - Bet 5: The post-ChatGPT software future 
12:10 - Bet 6: Graphical AI becomes normal 
13:10 - Bet 7: Careers repricing around dual fluency 
14:45 - Bet 8: Robotics breakthrough year ahead 
15:30 - Closing thoughts

The teams that win in 2026 will be the ones who stop treating LLMs as magic content generators and start building composable, constrained systems with real verification loops — but only if they can hold technical depth and customer outcomes in one head.
