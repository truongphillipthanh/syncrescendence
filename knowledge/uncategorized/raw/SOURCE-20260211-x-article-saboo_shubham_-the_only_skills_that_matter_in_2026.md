On the right side, five red/rust-colored underlined skill labels are clustered: "problem shaping", "context", "orchestration", "taste", and "restraint".)

Six months ago, I would have hired for skills I now consider worthless.

Not "less important." Not "evolving." Worthless. The skills that made developers valuable for the last decade got commoditized in one model generation. Not slowly. Not gradually. In the time between Gemini 3 pro and Claude Opus 4.6.

And most people haven't updated their mental model yet.

Meanwhile, the people shipping the fastest have almost entirely stopped writing code from scratch.

I've spent the last year building agents daily, maintaining the [Awesome LLM Apps](https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps) repo with 100+ open-source implementations, and shipping AI products at Google. I've watched the skills that matter shift in real time.

## What got commoditized

- **Writing code from scratch.** Agents do it faster and with fewer bugs.
- **Boilerplate and scaffolding.** One prompt. Done.
- **Memorizing syntax and APIs.** Context windows killed this.
- **Translating specs to code.** The spec IS the code now.

Agents do all of them now. Not always perfectly. Not without supervision. But fast enough that the bottleneck moved permanently upstream.

An intern out-shipped a senior developer last week at a startup I advise. Not because the intern was better. Because they shaped the problem clearly and let Claude Code do the rest. The senior dev spent three days hand-writing what the intern shipped in an afternoon.

This isn't an anomaly. It's the new baseline.

The skills above mattered because implementation was hard. They required years of practice. They justified six-figure salaries.

Implementation isn't the bottleneck anymore. And most of the industry is still optimizing for the old bottleneck. The value shifted to five skills. Every person I know who's building effectively with agents has developed these, whether they name them or not.

## The new skillset

### Skill 1: Problem shaping

Taking ambiguity and turning it into something an agent can act on. This is the skill that separates people who dabble with AI from people who build real products with it.

The skill is decomposition. Not "build me a dashboard." That's a wish, not a task.

Problem shaping turns that into twelve specific, testable sub-tasks with clear success criteria. What data does the dashboard show? What decisions does it inform? What should someone understand in the first three seconds?

When you break a vague goal into precise sub-problems, agents execute at a completely different level. Each sub-problem has clear inputs, clear outputs, clear success criteria. The agent doesn't have to guess what you mean.

Consider the C compiler fully built by Claude Code and Opus 4.6. One human shaped the problem. Sixteen agents executed. The result was 100,000 lines of working Rust. The human didn't write the code. They decomposed the problem so precisely that agents could build a compiler from the decomposition alone.

The leverage isn't in writing code. It's in breaking problems into pieces that agents can't get wrong.

This is why problem shaping is now the highest-value skill. Not because it's new. PMs and senior engineers have always done this. But when the gap between "well-shaped problem" and "shipped product" collapses to hours, the quality of the problem shaping becomes the entire ballgame.

### Skill 2: Context curation

The quality of what an agent produces is directly proportional to the context you feed it.

Here's what bad context looks like:
```
Build me a customer support agent.
```

Here's what good context looks like:
```
Target user: SaaS customers who are frustrated and considering canceling. 
They've already tried the help docs. They're messaging because docs failed them. 
Tone: Empathetic but efficient. Don't over-apologize. Don't be robotic. 

Here are 3 real tickets that got 5-star ratings: [examples]
Here are 2 that got complaints: [examples]

Edge cases requiring human handoff:
- Billing disputes over $500
- Account security concerns
- Legal or compliance questions

Success metric: Resolution without escalation in under 4 messages.
```

Same model. Same task. The first prompt gets you a generic chatbot. The second gets you something that feels like it was trained on your product for months.

The best builders I know spend more time writing context docs than writing code. They maintain CLAUDE.md files, .cursor/rules, GEMINI.md files that load automatically into every session. The agent starts every conversation already understanding their world.

When I build a new agent for the Awesome LLM Apps repo, I never start from scratch. My context docs already know what "good" looks like, what patterns to use, what mistakes to avoid. First output is 90% there instead of 50%.

That 40% gap is the difference between "technically works" and "actually ships." And it comes entirely from context, not from coding ability.

### Skill 3: Taste

Taste means knowing what to build before it exists. Knowing what "good" looks like when you're staring at ten options and nine of them are wrong.

Last week I asked Antigravity to build a new agent for the Awesome LLM Apps repo. An AI negotiation battle simulator where two agents haggle over a used car, buyer versus seller, with distinct personalities and live streaming via AG-UI.

The first version ran perfectly. Clean code. No errors. Agents negotiated back and forth. Technically complete.

I rejected it in thirty seconds.

The UI was a plain chat window. The negotiation felt like reading a log file. There were no personalities, no tension, no moment where you're watching a "Shark Steve" hold firm against a "Cool-Hand Casey" bluffing a walkaway. It worked as software. It failed as an experience.

With 93k+ stars on the repo, I've seen how developers actually engage with agent demos. They decide in under ten minutes if something is worth their time. A working agent isn't enough. It has to feel like something you want to show someone.

An agent can build anything you describe. It can't tell you what's worth describing. The agent optimized for correctness. I optimized for "would someone actually clone this?"

That's taste. Not design sense in the abstract. The accumulated judgment of what makes someone star a repo versus close the tab.

When agents produce output quickly and in bulk, the person who can spot which version actually lands is the most valuable person in the room. This is harder to develop than it sounds. You can't read a book about taste. You build it by shipping things, watching what users actually do, and developing an instinct for the gap between "works" and "worth using."

One exercise that helps: review your last five agent outputs. For each one, write down what you'd change and why. That "why" is taste developing.

### Skill 4: Agent orchestration

Knowing when to use one agent versus many. When to run parallel versus sequential. When to add guardrails versus letting it run. When to step in and debug manually versus letting the agent work through it.

That last one matters more than people think. Agents are good at tracing errors, but they can also get stuck in loops, retrying the same failed approach over and over. Knowing when to let the agent debug and when to step in yourself is a real skill. Blind trust in agent debugging is as costly as doing it all manually.

The three patterns that matter:

- **Sequential pipeline.** Agent A finishes, passes output to Agent B. Simple. Predictable. Use this when each step depends on the previous one. A research agent gathers data, then an analysis agent interprets it, then a writing agent drafts the report.

- **Coordinator with specialized team.** One lead agent delegates to specialists and synthesizes their work. Use this when you need quality control. The coordinator catches when a specialist goes off track, re-prompts, and merges the results. This is how I build most complex workflows now.

- **Parallel execution with merge.** Multiple agents run simultaneously on independent tasks, then a final agent combines the outputs. Use this when sub-tasks don't depend on each other. Run market research, competitor analysis, and user interviews in parallel. Merge at the end. What used to take a sequential afternoon now takes minutes.

Most people default to sequential because it feels safe. But knowing when to parallelize and when to add a coordinator is the difference between an agent workflow that takes five minutes and one that takes an hour.

The best developers in 2026 are more like film directors than programmers. They set the scene, cast the agents, and know when to yell cut. They don't write every line. They shape the performance.

You learn this by building. Not by reading about it.

### Skill 5: Knowing when NOT to use Agents (aka Judgement)

This sounds contradictory in an article about agent-era skills. But the trap is real. When Claude Code can build anything you describe, you start describing everything to Claude Code.

I catch myself reaching for agents for problems that don't need an agent at all. A quick UI tweak. A config change. A simple refactor. The agent overhead, the context loading, the prompt crafting, the output evaluation, sometimes exceeds the value of the task itself.

Not every problem needs an agent. Some problems need a fast model and a clear prompt.

Need to reformat a JSON file? Throw it at Gemini 3 Flash. Simple copy change across ten files? A quick prompt to any lightweight model handles it in seconds. Bug that you already understand? Faster to fix it yourself than to explain it to an agent.

The skill is matching the tool to the problem. Agents for ambiguous, multi-step work where you need to explore the solution space. Fast models for simple, well-defined tasks where you already know the answer. Your own hands for the things you can type faster than you can describe.

The people who are most effective aren't the ones who use agents for everything. They're the ones who reach for the right tool at the right level. Agent when the problem is hard. Model when the problem is simple. Keyboard when the problem is obvious.

## How to build these skills

You can't develop any of these by reading about them. You develop them by building.

- **Taste:** Review your last 5 agent outputs. Write down what you'd change and why.
- **Context:** Write a CLAUDE.md for your current project. Spend 30 minutes.
- **Problem shaping:** Take your next vague request and decompose it into 10 sub-tasks before prompting.
- **Orchestration:** Take a sequential workflow and identify which steps could run in parallel.
- **Knowing your tools:** Track for one week when you used an agent for something a simple prompt would have handled.

Pick one. Do it today. The intuition builds faster than you think.

## What's actually left

The skills that mattered for twenty years mattered because implementation was hard. Implementation isn't hard anymore.

What's left is everything upstream. Taste. Context curation. Problem decomposition. Agent orchestration. And the judgment to know when to reach for an agent, when a simple model prompt is enough, and when to use your own hands.

These aren't new skills exactly. The best engineers and PMs always had them. But they used to be buried under layers of implementation work. Now they're exposed. Now they're the whole job.

Open your last project. Ask yourself: did you spend more time writing code or shaping the problem? If the answer is code, you're building with the old skillset.

The new one starts with a context doc and a clear problem statement. The code writes itself.
