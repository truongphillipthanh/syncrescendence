## Post 1 (Original)
Nightshift is a dopamine hidden gem for agentic junkies. You go to sleep, agents wake up and fix your codebase, you wake up to a bunch of PRs with clean-ups and refactors ready to review. It's optimized for leftover tokens [github.com/marcus/nightsh...](https://github.com/marcus/nightshift) by @zzzmarcus
(Description: GitHub card preview for marcus/nightshift repository showing: "Nightshift uses your leftover Claude / Codex budget to surprise you with useful PRs. Love them or leave them." with repository statistics: 4 Contributors, 11 Issues, 715 Stars, 27 Forks)

"worst case you close the PR", it's like a surprise from leftover tokens 😁 which you can schedule once a week or so

## Post 3 (Reply to Advait)
Hehe, more likely LPU usage (like Groq or Cerebras) which will be dominant for inference.. GPUs with HBMs will train models based on yesterday's night PRs :P

## Post 4 (Reply to void)
easy..Go is good because of human readability (wake up and review PRs, human), language is idiomatic (easier for LLMs ), strong toolchain, single binary, fast compile. wdyt is a better option for such a product?

Yes, tokens u didn't spend if you have fixed price plan, so you can play during setup with schedule of nightshifters
