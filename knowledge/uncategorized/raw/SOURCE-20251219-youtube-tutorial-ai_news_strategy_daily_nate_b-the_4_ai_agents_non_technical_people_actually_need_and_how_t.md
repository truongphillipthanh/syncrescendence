What's really happening with AI agents when everything claims to be one? The common story is that agents require technical skills to use — but the reality is that four tools can handle most of what non-technical people need.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on building a team of reliable AI agents:

 • Why the "little guy theory" sets the right expectations
 • How four knobs control agent reliability and risk
 • What Manus, Notion AI, Lovable, and Zapier actually do well
 • Where to start with specific exercises you can run today
