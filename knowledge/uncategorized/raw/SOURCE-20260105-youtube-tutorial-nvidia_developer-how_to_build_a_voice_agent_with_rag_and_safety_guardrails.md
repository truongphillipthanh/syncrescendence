## Description (no transcript available)

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to build a voice agent using the latest NVIDIA Nemotron models. 

You’ll learn how to integrate four core components: multimodal RAG to retrieve relevant text and images, automatic speech recognition (ASR) to convert live audio into text, a safety model to filter safe or unsafe content and long-context reasoning to generate accurate, grounded responses.
