_______________________
What's really happening with entry-level careers in the AI economy? The common story is that this is a temporary hiring freeze — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why high agency plus AI fluency is the only viable career strategy:

 • Why the traditional career ladder is being disassembled mid-climb
 • How AI acts as a forcing function on your degree of agency
 • What an internal locus of control actually looks like in practice
 • Why solo founders are building $80 million exits in six months

Entry-level hiring has collapsed 50% since 2019. The routine tasks that once trained newcomers are precisely what AI handles now. The gap between high agency and low agency people that once took 20 years to emerge now manifests in months.

For professionals navigating this shift, the opportunity is real — but passive approaches no longer produce outcomes.
