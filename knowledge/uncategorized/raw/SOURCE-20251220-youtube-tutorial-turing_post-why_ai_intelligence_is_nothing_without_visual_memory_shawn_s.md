# Why AI Intelligence is Nothing Without Visual Memory | Shawn Shen on the Future of Embodied AI

## Description (no transcript available)

We often confuse intelligence with memory. But in the human brain, reasoning and retrieval are separate processes. Shawn Shen – founder of Memories.ai and former researcher at Meta Reality Labs – believes that for AI to move from chatbots to the physical world – into robots, glasses, and wearables – it must stop trying to memorize everything in the model weights and start "seeing" like a human. 

He explains why the next leap in AI is about long-term visual persistence and breaks down why today's Transformers struggle with object permanence and how his team is building the "hippocampus" for embodied agents. Super interesting!

*In this episode of Inference, we get into:*
"Encode for Machine": Why we need to stop compressing video for human eyes and start compressing it for AI logic.
The critical architectural split between the Intelligence Model (creative, generative) and the Memory Model (retrieval, factual).
Why Transformers don’t understand physics or time – and why World Models are the answer.
The brutal engineering constraints of running infinite visual memory on-device without Wi-Fi.
How to build a system that remembers your life without becoming a surveillance nightmare.
Why The Mom Test is the most important book for researchers transitioning to product builders.
We also discuss the "Era of I Don't Know" in research, the limitations of current context windows, and the future where your smart glasses actually know if you’ve been eating healthy this week.
This is a conversation about the missing half of the AI brain, the move from cloud to edge, and how we give machines a sense of time. Watch it!
