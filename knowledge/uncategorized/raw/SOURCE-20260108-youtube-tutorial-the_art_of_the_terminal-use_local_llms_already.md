## Description (no transcript available)

‼️ LLM providers are not safe for you
‼️ There are 4 reasons to switch 100% local

🤯 I'm sharing my experience using local GenAI for 1.5 years: for learning, research, coding, technical troubleshooting, generating images and more 

🥷🏻 Steal my setup
⚙️ ...configure images generation from within a chat UI
⚙️ ...get around AI slop by doing deep research locally & with a 100% private web search
⚙️ ...learn to find & use uncensored models
🚀 Want to gain KNOWLEDGE, not just consume information? Try my LLM-augmented learning technique "The Chainsaw"
