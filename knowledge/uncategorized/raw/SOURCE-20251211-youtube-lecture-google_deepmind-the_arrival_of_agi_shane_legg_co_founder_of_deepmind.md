Shane Legg, Chief AGI Scientist and co-founder of Google DeepMind, has been talking about artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for more than a decade. So what’s changed? According to Shane, now is the time to take it seriously.

In this episode, Shane walks host Hannah Fry through his AGI framework, breaking down the levels from minimal AGI to full AGI, and his timelines for each. They discuss the economic and societal shifts AGI will bring, the potential impact on work, and the extraordinary possibilities for human flourishing.
