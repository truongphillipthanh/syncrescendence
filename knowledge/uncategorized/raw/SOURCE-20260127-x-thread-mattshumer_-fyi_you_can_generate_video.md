  - "Matt Shumer - Nano Banana video generation"
synopsis: "Matt Shumer demonstrates a frame-by-frame video generation technique using Claude for prompt sequencing and Nano Banana Pro for image generation — essentially AI-powered stop motion. Each frame prompt is informed by the previous generated image."
key_insights:
  - "Frame-by-frame video generation with Nano Banana Pro works by having Claude write sequential prompts, each informed by the previous generated frame, then combining them."
  - "The technique is primitive but functional — essentially AI stop-motion animation using image generation rather than dedicated video models."
  - "This approach gives more directorial control over each frame compared to end-to-end video generation models."

## Post 1

**FYI you can generate video with Nano Banana!**

It's super primitive, but with enough effort, it should work really well!

Here's how:

**First, tell Claude what you want to generate.**

Then say: *"We're going to go frame-by-frame. Generate a prompt for the first frame. I will then pass you the image that is generated as a result, and you will write the next prompt for the next frame."*

For each prompt, pass it to **Nano Banana Pro**. When the image is generated, give it to Claude, and ask for the next prompt.

Repeat until you have the frames you need, then have Claude combine them.

**It's basically stop motion but with AI!**
