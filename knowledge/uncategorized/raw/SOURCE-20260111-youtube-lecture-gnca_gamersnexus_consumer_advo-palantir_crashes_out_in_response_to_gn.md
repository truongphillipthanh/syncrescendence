In this video, we go over the Palantir Head of Strategic Engagement's response to GNCA's coverage of Palantir partnering with NVIDIA. After initially declining, the Palantir Head of Strategic Engagement eventually welcomed us to visit Palantir's offices to "do something cool." We plan to take him up on this offer as we discuss the surveillance state created by companies like Palantir on camera. They have multiple locations, so we'll either go to DC or Denver, Colorado to meet Palantir.
