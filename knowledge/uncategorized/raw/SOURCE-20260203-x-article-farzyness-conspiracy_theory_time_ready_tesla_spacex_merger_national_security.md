# Conspiracy theory time. Ready?

This one is very spicy. I don't think you're ready.

Tesla will be a US only company soon because of national security issues.

This will allow it to merge with SpaceX to create America's singular most powerful, most important business.

## Let me walk you through it.

Now with SpaceX and xAI fully merged, the smoke around SpaceX and Tesla merging is gaining steam. But the only way for the SpaceX/Tesla merger to work is by removing the risk of CFIUS.

CFIUS is a US regulatory body that reviews foreign investments in US businesses and real estate to assess potential national security risks.

Another way of saying it - Tesla's China relationship with Giga Shanghai presents a big national security risk if Tesla is merged with SpaceX. SpaceX has tons of government contracts with the US. xAI also has contracts with the US government. If merged, that same company would also be a big player in China - the US' direct competitor.

That doesn't play. That's a massive conflict of interest. And a huge national security issue.

However, what if Tesla were to break apart its non-US based businesses into its own entity - let's call it Tesla International.

And then you take all that's left, which is the US portion, and roll that sucker into SpaceX.

The US portion has all your most important national security assets anyway - AI chips, humanoids, rockets, self-driving cars. On top of energy.

## Right?

I'm actually starting to feel quite nervous about Tesla's prospects globally. I think self-driving cars, humanoid robots, drones, AI - these are all MASSIVE national security threats. I don't think the US would be comfortable with having millions of AI-powered drones, cars, or robots manufactured in China all over the country. Or vice-versa.

You're basically inviting your competitor to take over your country with next-gen technology. Seems like a stupid idea.

What's more likely to happen is for each superpower to become much more insular - focused on building its manufacturing and supply chain capability to serve itself.

And with the merger of Tesla and SpaceX (and xAI), the US would have an absolute behemoth of an entity that will be the entire foundation for the next-generation of AI, energy, robotics, and transportation.

The country's next 50-100 years will literally be built on top of the infrastructure that Tesla will provide through its products.

Solar panels and batteries for power on earth and in space. Robots for all its labor needs. Self driving for all its transportation needs. AI in space for all its intelligence needs. Even drones - Tesla has everything it needs to make one. I fully expect that they will by the way.

## I think Tesla's days are numbered. The Convergence is inevitable.
