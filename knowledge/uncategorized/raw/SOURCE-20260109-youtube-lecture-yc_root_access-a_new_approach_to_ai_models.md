## Description (no transcript available)

During last month’s NeurIPS 2025 conference, YC’s Ankit Gupta sat down with Karan Goel, founder and CEO of Cartesia, to explain why today’s AI architectures may be fundamentally limited. They discuss why transformers behave more like retrieval systems than learning systems, how state space models enable compression and abstraction, and why multimodal intelligence may require a whole new approach. The conversation also covers why Cartesia chose AI voice as a wedge product, and how research-driven companies can balance deep technical bets with real-world product discipline.
