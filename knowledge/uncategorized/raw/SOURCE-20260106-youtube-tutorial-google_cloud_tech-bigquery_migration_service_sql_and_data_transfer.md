Following your migration assessment, it is time to execute the transfer of your data and SQL queries into Google Cloud. This video dives into the specific tools and services that simplify migrating workloads from Snowflake, Teradata, Cloudera, and Databricks into BigQuery, Dataproc, and Google Cloud Storage. 

Learn how to leverage the power of Gemini and automated SQL translation services to convert complex dialects into BigQuery compatible Google SQL. We also explore the BigQuery Data Transfer Service (DTS) for both full on demand and incremental migrations and additional migration tools, ensuring your transition is cost effective and optimized for performance.
