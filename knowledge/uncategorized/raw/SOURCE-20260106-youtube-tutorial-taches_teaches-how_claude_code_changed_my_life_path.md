## Description (no transcript available)

Check out my company: https://sequins.music
Get the system I used to do it: https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done

I built a $32K software company in 40 days using Claude Code without writing a single line of code. Here's how.

Some thoughts:

1. Declarative knowledge vs procedural knowledge
You don't need to know how to do something. You just need to know that something exists so you can ask AI how to do it.

2. Assume everything is possible
Your job as a Claude Code user is to dream bigger than what's commonly known to be possible. Don't start from limitations. Start from what you want and work backwards.

3. The creative synthesis is yours
AI doesn't sit down and decide to fuse disparate concepts. That's the human bit. You take two unrelated things and ask "what if we merged them?" — that's where the interesting stuff happens.

4. Procedural knowledge deficit is why most people don't build things
It's not lack of ideas. It's the scary incline between here and being able to actually make something. AI collapses that gap.

5. Own the entire pipeline (as much as possible)
Don't outsource to services that charge monthly for something you could build yourself exactly the way you want it. Roll it from scratch. Keep the data. Control the UX.

6. Ship things
You're a developer if you develop things and ship them. That's actually more than a lot of developers do.
