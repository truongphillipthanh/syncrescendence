## Description (no transcript available)

Claude Cowork brings Claude Code agent capabilities to non‑technical users by enabling local file and connector access and automating multi‑step workflows. Audience reactions mix excitement about APIs, scheduling, and parallel task automation with warnings about prompt‑injection and destructive file actions. Implications include accelerated productization and UI work to reach mainstream users, expanded demand for workplace agents, and market opportunities for startups rather than immediate vendor displacement.
