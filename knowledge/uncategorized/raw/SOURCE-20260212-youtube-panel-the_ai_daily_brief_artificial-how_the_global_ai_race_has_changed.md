## Description (no transcript available)

China's rapid model releases and multimodal breakthroughs, led by Moonshot's Kimi K2.5 and SeedDance2.0, are closing performance gaps with Western labs. Market shocks and regulatory fights, highlighted by DeepSeek's reasoning model surge and disputes over H200 exports and chip bans, are reshaping economic incentives and policy. New geopolitical actors and ambitions, from the UAE's G42 chip and data‑center diplomacy to orbital datacenter plans, are turning AI into a multi‑polar strategic contest.
