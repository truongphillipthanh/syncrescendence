# Palmer Luckey Will Change How You Think About War | #464 | The Way I Heard It

## Description (no transcript available)

Palmer Luckey is the virtual reality guy who started a company called Oculus when he was in his 20s and sold it to Facebook a few years later for a couple billion dollars. He has since gone on to do a number of interesting things, including starting a company called Anduril, which manufactures state-of-the-art weapons and a variety of autonomous systems for the United States military.

We had a fascinating conversation about a number of topics, including how to win future wars, deindustrialize our manufacturing base, and reinvigorate the skilled trades. And some Hobbit-related sidebars. Please enjoy.
