Episode 87: Can AI know you well enough to create audio content tailored to your interests—without you ever prompting it? Nathan Lands (https://x.com/NathanLands) is joined by Raiza Martin (https://x.com/raizamrtn), one of the creators behind Google’s NotebookLM and now co-founder of Huxe, a new startup carving the path toward truly personal AI.
Raiza shares her unconventional journey from leading innovation at Google to building Huxe, an app that generates personalized audio (think “AI radio made just for you”) driven by your daily habits and interests—without you having to initiate the conversation. The episode dives into what it means to design AI for real human needs, the balancing act of privacy and helpfulness, and the vision for a future where your AI assistant proactively enhances your everyday life. They also discuss where AI products are succeeding, how creating trust is an overlooked challenge, and why the next breakthrough will be more about fitting seamlessly into our routines than about being “smarter.”
