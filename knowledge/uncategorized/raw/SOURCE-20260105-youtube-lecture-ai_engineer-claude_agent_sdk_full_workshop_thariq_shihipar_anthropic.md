**AI Summary**
This workshop by Thariq Shihipar (Anthropic) details the architecture and implementation of the **Claude Agent SDK**. The session moves from high-level theory—defining "agents" as autonomous systems that manage their own context and trajectory—to a live-coding demonstration. Shihipar builds an agent "Harness" from scratch, implementing the core **Agent Loop** (Context  Thought  Action  Observation), integrating the **Bash tool** for general computer use, and demonstrating **Context Engineering** via the file system to maintain state across long tasks.

**Timestamps**

00:00 Introduction: Agenda and the "Agent" definition
05:15 The "Harness" concept: Tools, Prompts, and Skills
10:10 Live Coding Setup: Initializing the Agent class and environment
15:45 implementing the "Think" step: Getting the model to reason before acting
25:20 The Agent Loop: connecting `act`, `observe`, and `loop`
33:10 Tool Execution: Handling XML parsing and tool inputs
42:00 The "Bash" Tool: Giving the agent command line access
49:30 Safety & Permissions: "ReadOnly" vs "ReadWrite" file access
58:15 Context Engineering: Using `ls` and `cat` to build dynamic context
01:05:00 The "Monitor": Viewing the agent's thought process in real-time
01:12:45 Handling "Stuck" States: Feedback loops and error correction
01:21:20 Multi-turn Complex Tasks: Building a "Research Agent" demo
01:35:10 Refactoring patterns: "Hooks" and deterministic overrides
01:48:39 Q&A: Reproducibility, helper scripts, and non-determinism
01:50:31 Q&A: Strategies for massive codebases (50M+ lines)
01:52:00 Closing remarks and future SDK roadmap

* **Evolution of AI Capabilities:** Shihipar argues we are shifting from **LLM Features** (categorization, single turn) to **Workflows** (structured, multi-step chains like RAG) to **Agents**. He defines agents as systems that *"build their own context, decide their own trajectories, and work very autonomously"* rather than following a rigid pipeline.
* **The Claude Agent SDK Architecture:** The SDK is built directly on top of **Claude Code** because Anthropic found they were *"rebuilding the same parts over and over again"* for internal tools.
* **The Harness:** A robust agent requires more than just a model; it needs a "Harness" containing Tools, Prompts, a **File System**, Skills, Sub-agents, and Memory.
* **Opinionated Design:** The SDK bakes in lessons from deploying Claude Code, specifically the "opinion" that general computer use (Bash) is often superior to bespoke tools.


* **The Power of the Bash Tool:** A key technical insight is that the **Bash tool** is often the most powerful tool for an agent. Instead of building custom tools for every action (e.g., a specific API wrapper for a file conversion), giving the agent access to the shell allows it to use existing software (like `ffmpeg`, `grep`, or `git`) to solve problems flexibly, similar to how a human developer works.
* **Context Engineering:** Shihipar introduces the concept of **Context Engineering** via the file system. Instead of just "Prompt Engineering," the agent uses the file system to manage its state and context.
* **Files as Memory:** The agent can write to files to "remember" things or create its own documentation (e.g., `CLAUDE.md`) to ground future actions.
* **Verification:** The file system serves as a ground truth for the agent to verify its work (e.g., checking if a file was actually created).


* **The Agent Loop & Intuition:** Building a successful agent loop is described as *"kind of an art or intuition"*. The loop generally follows a **Gather Context  Take Action  Verify Work** cycle. Shihipar emphasizes that this loop allows the agent to self-correct, a capability missing from rigid workflows.
* **Strategies for Determinism (Hooks):** During the Q&A, a technique for controlling agent behavior is discussed: **Hooks**.
* If an agent hallucinates or skips a step (e.g., guessing a Pokemon stat instead of checking a script), a hook can intercept the response and inject feedback: *"Please make sure you write a script, please make sure you read this data."*
* This enforces rules like "read before you write" without retraining the model.


* **Scaling to Large Codebases:** For massive codebases (50M+ lines), standard tools like `grep` or basic context window stuffing fail.
* **Semantic Search Limitations:** Shihipar notes that while semantic search is a common solution, it is *"brittle"* because the model isn't trained on the specific semantic index.
* **Solution:** He recommends good **"Claude MD"** files (context files) and starting the agent in a specific subdirectory to limit scope, rather than trying to index the entire 50M lines at once.
