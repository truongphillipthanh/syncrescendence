# New Version of summarize.sh 0.11 Release
New version of [summarize.sh](https://t.co/VBw4Rt1V5A) is out! 0.11 can now even use cursor for free tokens + uses Groq for way faster TTS inference + lots lots of other improvements. [github.com/steipete/summarize/releases/tag/v0.11.1](https://github.com/steipete/summarize/releases/tag/v0.11.1)
## Usage
summarize [youtube.com/watch\\?v\\=n1E9IZfvGMA --slides](https://youtube.com/watch?v=n1E9IZfvGMA)
My favorite way to consume YT. Or Podcasts. or literally any website or remote or local file.
## Features
Powers the content efficient file summarization for [@openclaw](https://twitter.com/openclaw) but also really nice for humans, especially with --slides.
It's also a Chrome extension. because why not. [chromewebstore.google.com/detail/summarize](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/summarize/cejgnmmhbbpdmjnfppjdfkocebngehfg)
## Screenshot
(Description: A macOS terminal window showing the summarize project interface with code visible. A headshot photo of Peter Steinberger in front of a bookshelf appears on the left side. Below is "Slide 4/6 - 01:53:01" with visible text reading: "Compute, revenue, and 'responsible' scaling. AModel introduces concrete numbers to argue adoption is already extremely fast while acknowledging it cannot remain exponential forever. He cites Anthropic's revenue growth (as described in the observation)")
