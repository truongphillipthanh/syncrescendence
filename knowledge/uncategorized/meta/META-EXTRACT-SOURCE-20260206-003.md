**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The availability of AI skills for complex tasks like legal work, consulting reports, and security assessments threatens industries that previously charged high fees for specialized expertise, as these can now be produced by downloading a folder and pressing 'go'.

**Lines**: 80-86
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.70

> A primary goal of AI development for companies is worker replacement, with the ideal number of human employees often being zero, driven by the potential to save trillions in global knowledge worker compensation.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-003-0011

**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.50

> An AI product or model that can seamlessly pivot between enough general capabilities or skills to perform the work of an average knowledge worker will be considered 'generally' intelligent in a practical sense, leading to human layoffs.

## Concept (3)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-003-0001
**Lines**: 10-17
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The author defines AGI in practical, everyday terms as the ability to perform tasks that an average knowledge worker could do but technology could not do up through 2022, focusing on 'generality' rather than theoretical synthetic intelligence.
