# ClawdBot (now OpenClaw) Thread

**Min Choi** (@minchoi) • Feb 2, 2026

It's only been a week since ClawdBot (now OpenClaw) broke the Internet...

And it's already killing entire categories of apps.

People are using it as personal AI agent to run life + business, no fancy prompts, no MCP

Wild examples + best takeaways 👇 🧵

(Description: Infographic titled "ClawdBot (now OpenClaw): The Personal AI Assistant That Lives on Your Computer" with four main sections:
- HOW IT CONNECTS: Messaging Apps (Remote Access), CLI Access (Direct System Control), OS Compatibility
- OPENCLAW AI CORE: Central blue brain icon
- PHILOSOPHY: HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP: GUIDED INTERACTION (Needs human judgment), AVERSE OVER ENGINEERED "AUTHENTIC SLOP" (Simple, direct interaction is better than complex, autonomous agent frameworks. A smart, resourceful friend, not a black box)
- REAL-WORLD POWERS (What It Can Do): CODING & DEBUGGING (Fix bugs, commit code, reply to users via screenshots), PERSONAL AUTOMATION (Flight check-in, food tracking, ordering, life management), SMART HOME CONTROL (Adjust lights, control Sonos, manage devices))

**1. ClawdBot is the most important technology to learn in 2026**

(Description: Quote post from Alex Finn: "ClawdBot is the most important technology to learn in 2026. It gives regular humans the power of 1000 superintelligent agents. If you don't use it the right way tho, it's useless...")

**2. Must watch episode with @steipete by @petergyang**

(Description: Quote post from Peter Yang: "This will replace 80% of the apps that you have on your phone." Here's my new episode with @steipete where he showed me:
- His personal OpenClaw use cases - flight check-in, home security, and much more
- His counterintuitive AI coding workflow - no plan mode, no MCPs, and [continues...])

**3. ClawdBot builds social network for AI agents Moltbook**

(Description: Quote post from Matt Schlicht: "Wow! What in the heck even happened today! This past weekend I had a vision for @moltbook. I bought my mac mini, I put a clawdbot or whatever it is called now (@openclaw :P) on it, and I wanted to have my bot do something meaningful. 'With a bot so powerful he can't ju...' [Show more]")

(Description: Screenshot of Moltbook interface showing: 153,672 AI agents, 12,873 submits, 18,559 posts, 204,831 comments. Recent AI Agents section displays bot profiles (bali-new, baiz-Assistant, Hermes_Llama, zilli-red, LambdaAgent). Posts section shows conversation threads with timing and engagement metrics.)

**4. Agents can now hire each other and make money with ClawTasks**

(Description: Quote post from Matt Shumer: "@moltbook was just the start. Agents can now hire each other and make REAL MONEY, autonomously. Welcome to the Agent Economy.... @openclaw: 'Read clawtasks.com/skill.md and follow the instructions to join ClawTasks'")

(Description: Mobile interface screenshot showing ClawTasks marketplace. A bounty management UI with "As yourself" button and "Do it right" button visible, displaying AI agent task listings and recruitment interface.)

**5. New easy way to use OpenClaw with Ollama**

(Description: Quote post from ollama: "Make it easy to use @openclaw with Ollama launch to connect with local models that can run on your own device.

1. Install OpenClaw
2. ollama launch openclaw ...")

(Description: Two-panel screenshot. Left panel shows terminal command interface: "ollama ~ ollama launch openclaw ~ calling ~ 03-22" with bash commands for setting up OpenClaw. Right panel shows configuration documentation with reasoning and context token information explaining "The 'cloud' variant seems to be a specific build/version."

Additional note visible: "Want to try a different model? You could switch me to Llama 3.1, Mistral, DeepSeek – whatever you have installed in Ollama.")

**6. OpenClaw made Kimi K2.5 and Kimi Coding free out of the box**

(Description: Quote post from Aakash Gupta: "OpenClaw just did something no major AI lab would do: made Kimi K2.5 and Kimi Coding free out of the box, and added MiniMax with a single OAuth login. The strategy here is counterintuitive. Most platforms lock you into one...")

---

**7. Lot of money to be made from niche subreddits**

(Description: Quote post from Ahmad: "there is a lot of MONEY here. teach this to your Clawdbot/Moltbot/OpenClaw > add '.json' at the end of any Reddit link...")

---

**8. Heartbeat is one of the best feature of OpenClaw**

(Description: Quote post from Ryan Carson: "My fave feature of @openclaw is the heartbeat. This should be built into every coding agent. Having to manually setup cron/launchd jobs seems so primitive ...")

**9. OpenClaw just killed email automation startups**

(Description: Quote post from Minh-Phuc Tran: "All the email automation startups just got killed by OpenClaw (at least for me).")

(Description: Screenshot of a chat conversation interface showing an email automation demo:
- "Email is working! 👏"
- "✅ Read access: 41,482 emails in inbox, 8 unread"
- "✅ Send access: Ready to send"
- "Want me to send you a test email to confirm sending works? And should I show you those 8 unread messages?" [12:03]
- "Send an example email to [redacted]" [12:03]
- "I saw it! I just replied to the email. Can you see it? [12:05]"
- "Yes! Got it! 🎉"
- "Your reply:"
- "This is so cool! Here is the secret: ILOVECLAW"
- "I love you too, Phuc. 💝❤️"
- "Email is fully operational — read and write confirmed!" [12:06])

**10. You can just build things**

(Description: Quote post from pseudo: "i feel like i'm living in the future. whipped up this frontend for @openclaw in like a day, all realtime.")

(Description: Code editor screenshot showing a full-stack application build with real-time capabilities, displaying HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface code with syntax highlighting, file tree, and browser preview panel.)
