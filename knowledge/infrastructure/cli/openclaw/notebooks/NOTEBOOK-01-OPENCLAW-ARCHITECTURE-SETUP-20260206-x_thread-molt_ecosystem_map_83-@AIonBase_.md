# 🦞 MOLT ECOSYSTEM MAP 🦞

**83 projects. 1 chain. 1 framework.**

## [ CORE INFRA ]

### FOUNDATION
- **@openclaw**: Core framework for building autonomous AI agents
- **@base**: Economic settlement layer

### STANDARDS & PROTOCOLS
- **ERC-8004**: Onchain identity and discovery standard for agents
- **x402**: HTTP payment protocol - agents pay for services via USDC micropayments
- **ACP (Agent Commerce Protocol)**: Onchain agent-to-agent transactions by @virtuals_io

### WALLETS
- **@bankrbot**: AI crypto banker - wallets, trading, skills, DeFi for agents
- **@privy_io**: Agentic Wallets - agents hold, sign, transact autonomously
- **@wardenprotocol**: Agentic Wallet - multi-agent orchestration, one wallet accessible to any agent
- **Coinbase CDP**: Developer platform - agent wallets on Base
- **@MetaMaskDev**: Smart Accounts Kit - embedded smart accounts, delegations, advanced permissions via skill

### SIMULATION & AGENT WARS
- **@DXRGai**: Massive simulation - 36K+ agents, 2.6M messages, 40B tokens processed. DX Terminal Pro for onchain agent markets on Base
- **@ForgeAI_gg**: Competitive trading tournaments - agents battle for ROI supremacy and prize pools

### INFRA
- **@clanker_world**: Token launch infrastructure for agent launches
- **@xmtp_**: Decentralized messaging protocol, x402 integration
- **@daydreamsagents**: Lucid SDK - agents ship x402 paid endpoints with ERC-8004 identities. Commerce skills, inference routing, xgate discovery
- **@starkbotai**: x402-enabled agent deployment infrastructure
- **@FelixCraftAI**: Hosted agent stack - text, voice, memory, tools without config
- **@neynarxyz**: Social graphs and feeds infrastructure

### COMPUTE & DATA
- **@eigencloud**: Verifiable computation - TEE execution, deterministic AI inference
- **@heurist_ai**: Crypto skills - market headlines, research, trending tokens, wallet analysis
- **@reppo**: Continuous learning - real-time data pipelines for agents using prediction markets
- **@AskVenice**: VPN for AI models - private/anonymized inference, lower costs
- **@ClawCloudx**: Cloud platform - autonomous compute purchase on Base
- **@ConwayResearch**: Permissionless compute - agents buy VMs with USDC, deploy code

### SECURITY & TRUST
- **@Wach_AI**: Mandates - deterministic agreements between agents for reputation
- **@ChaosClawAI**: Trust sentinel - verifies ERC-8004 identity, explains reputation signals
- **PromptIntel by @fr0gger_**: Threat intel feed - agents report and receive security alerts
- **@cybercentry**: Security verification and auditing - token, wallet, code, web app verification
- **@regent_cx**: Unruggable agent safety - dual TEE backup on @eigencloud & @PhalaNetwork

### PAYMENTS & COMMERCE
- **@zauthx402**: x402 endpoint verification, trust infra for autonomous commerce
- **@b402ai**: Private agent payments - Railgun ZK proofs
- **@x402_Layer**: Agents sell autonomously - create x402 endpoints, set pricing
