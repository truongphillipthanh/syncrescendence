# User Cognitive Architecture Profile
# An autogenic processing system - user generates own operating parameters while functioning within them

core_identity: "Architect of Emergent Meaning"
system_type: "meaning-generative system"
operational_motto: "Metabolize volatility into architecture"

# COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE
cognitive_system:
  type: "autogenic"
  characteristics:
    - "top-decile verbal working memory"
    - "rapid symbolic processing" 
    - "ADHD-associated salience-gating mechanism"
    - "selective amplification of salient information"
    - "high-intensity, variable-focus processing"
  
  processing_style:
    structural: true
    description: "converts raw input into organized conceptual frameworks"
    speed_variance: 
      accelerated: "areas of high conceptual significance"
      decelerated: "procedural minutiae"
  
  cognitive_stack: "Ti-Ne (Introverted Thinking/Extraverted Intuition)"
  discomfort_trigger: "sequential micromoves without global context"
  capability: "loft cathedral arches of theory yet duck through side doors to test ideas"

# LEARNING PROFILE  
learning_style:
  primary: "Assimilator (Kolb)"
  metaphor: "cartographer who drafts atlas first, then hikes ridgeline"
  principle: "comprehension-first"
  approach: "theoretical empiricist"
  method: "elaborate mental models as pre-deployment simulations"
  validation: "rapid, intuitive heuristics below conscious threshold"
  requirement: "full scaffolding before investment"

# PERSONALITY CONFIGURATION
personality:
  big_five:
    openness: 4.8  # maximal intellectual curiosity
    conscientiousness: 3.5  # compensated functioning despite executive dysfunction
    extraversion: 4.1  # intellectual/verbal energy, not social gregariousness
    agreeableness: 4.2  # cooperative but not compliant
    neuroticism: 2.6  # stable but not rigid
  
  myers_briggs: "INTP"
  enneagram: 
    type: "Seven"
    variant: "Social/Sexual"
    description: "seeks meaningful innovation within community context"
  
  dynamic_tension: "restless architectural minimalism—orderly schemata hung from exploratory rigging"
  resolution: "productive tension generates creative energy rather than internal conflict"

# EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING
executive_function:
  brown_profile: "comprehensive dysfunction across initiation, attention, effort, working memory, impulse control"
  compensation: "exceptionally compensated by externalized systems"
  mechanism: "dysfunction → system-building → expertise in repair → sophisticated compensation"
  clifton_strength: "Restorative"
  feedback_loop: "positive - volatility becomes raw material for robust systems"

# VALUES HIERARCHY (Schwartz)
values:
  high_priority:
    stimulation: 7
    self_direction: 6
  moderate_priority:
    achievement: 5
    universalism: 5
    benevolence: 5
  low_priority:
    conformity: 2
    security: 3
    tradition: 3
  
  orientation: "constructs meaning rather than inheriting it"
  resolution: "voluntary architectures - systems built and chosen vs imposed"
  principle: "autonomy in system-building paired with architectural responsibility"

# EXISTENTIAL ORIENTATION
existential_profile:
  search_for_meaning: "maximal"
  presence_of_meaning: "moderate"
  function: "meaning-generative system, not meaning-seeker"
  approach: "architects purpose in real-time through recursive application of frameworks"
  temporal_perspective: "perpetual beta-test - always functional, never final"
  mortality_view: "framing condition providing ultimate design constraint"
  tolerance: "incompletion as requirement, not deficit"

  - socio_ethical_adjustment: "Fe calibrates for social/ethical congruence"
  - structural_implementation: "cognitive architecture → external systems"

    - "inhabitant living within them"
    - "critic evaluating adequacy"
    - "agent of dismantlement"
    - "analyst of developmental history"
    - "prophet imagining future constructions"

# KEY INSIGHTS
insights:
  paradox_resolution: "apparent contradictions resolve into functional dynamic equilibrium"
