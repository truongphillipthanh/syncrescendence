Psychological Architecture Dossier
I.1 – Cognitive Capacity (WAIS-IV Approximation)
I possess top-decile verbal working memory, rapid symbolic processing, and strong abstract reasoning via pattern abstraction. ADHD modulates my signal—not by weakening cognition, but by making attention salience-dependent. I process in bursts: fast when it matters, scattered when it doesn’t. Spatial friction appears only when tasks require sequential micromoves without global context. I am a high-bandwidth, context-sensitive cognition engine.

I.2 – Cognitive Style (Gregorc Model)
I blend Abstract Sequential (system builder, theorist) with Concrete Random (intuitive experimenter). I operate like a polymathic architect—first constructing internal models, then tactically prototyping in the wild. I tolerate ambiguity but demand systemic elegance.

I.3 – Learning Style (Kolb)
I am an Assimilator: high in abstract conceptualization and reflective observation. I prefer to understand before I act. Trial-and-error is inefficient for my system—I must see the full scaffolding before investing effort. Learning is synthesis, not consumption.

I.4 – Big Five Personality
Openness: 4.8 — Maximal
Conscientiousness: 3.5 — Moderate
Extraversion: 4.1 — Energetic and rhetorically vibrant
Agreeableness: 4.2 — Principled and cooperative
Neuroticism: 2.6 — Emotionally stable. I am resilient, exploratory, and philosophically rigorous.

I.5 – Enneagram Subtype
Type 7 – Social/Sexual (So/Sx): Visionary-Architect. Driven by generative possibility, systemic freedom, and contribution. Intensity is ignition, not indulgence.

I.6 – MBTI Function Stack
INTP (Ti–Ne–Si–Fe): Governed by coherence, animated by ideas, modulated by system-based empathy. Internal logic leads, exploration follows, rhetorical calibration emerges in support.

I.7 – Brown Executive Function Profile (ADHD)
High-symptom ADHD with executive dysfunction in initiation, attention, effort, working memory, and impulse control. Exceptionally compensated by externalized systems. I metabolize volatility into architecture.

I.8 – CliftonStrengths
Top strengths: Restorative, Ideation, Intellection, Connectedness, Input. Animated by system coherence, novelty with purpose, and conceptual repair.

I.9 – Schwartz Values
Dominant: Stimulation (7), Self-Direction (6).
Secondary: Achievement (5), Universalism (5), Benevolence (5).
Repressed: Conformity (2), Security (3), Tradition (3).
My values animate my entire system—freedom, novelty, and alignment override tradition or safety.

I.10 – Existential Profile
Search for Meaning: Maximal. Presence of Meaning: Moderate. Meaning is constructed recursively, not inherited. I seek real-time coherence over legacy. Mortality frames my pursuit, not frightens it.

Final Identity Synthesis
Archetype: Architect of Emergent Meaning. I reject static meaning in favor of recursive coherence. I am cognitively high-bandwidth, philosophically anchored, and architecturally self-authored. I do not seek arrival. I construct alignment—through models, through language, through systems.
