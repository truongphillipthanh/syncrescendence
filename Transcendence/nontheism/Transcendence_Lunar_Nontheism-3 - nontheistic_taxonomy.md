# Comprehensive Taxonomic Framework for Nontheistic Belief Systems

## I. FOUNDATIONAL TAXONOMIC PRINCIPLES

### Hierarchical Structure Reasoning

**Primary Level (Ontological Foundation)**: The most fundamental distinction concerns the **ontological status of supernatural reality**—whether systems accept or reject entities/forces beyond natural causation. This serves as the root distinction because it determines all subsequent philosophical commitments about knowledge, ethics, meaning, and practice.

**Secondary Level (Epistemological-Methodological)**: Within each ontological category, systems differ fundamentally in their **approaches to knowledge and authority**—how they determine truth, validate claims, and structure understanding. This constitutes the second level because epistemological commitments directly shape all specific beliefs and practices.

**Tertiary Level (Axiological-Practical)**: The third level addresses **primary value orientations and practical applications**—what systems consider most important and how they translate beliefs into lived experience. This follows logically because value commitments emerge from ontological and epistemological foundations.

### Ordering Logic Reasoning

**Within-Level Ordering**: Categories are arranged by **increasing complexity and specificity**:
- From universal/foundational to particular/applied
- From theoretical to practical emphasis  
- From individual to collective focus
- From ancient/traditional to contemporary/innovative

**Cross-Level Coherence**: The taxonomy maintains **logical consistency** where higher-level commitments constrain lower-level possibilities, ensuring philosophical coherence while allowing for diversity within compatible frameworks.
