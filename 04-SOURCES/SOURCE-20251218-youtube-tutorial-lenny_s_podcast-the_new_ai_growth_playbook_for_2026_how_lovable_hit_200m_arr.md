# The new AI growth playbook for 2026 | How Lovable hit $200M ARR in one year

## Description (no transcript available)

Elena Verna is the head of growth at Lovable, the leading AI-powered app builder that hit $200 million in annual recurring revenue in under a year with just 100 employees. In this record fourth appearance on the podcast, Elena shares how the traditional growth playbook has been completely rewritten for AI companies. She explains why Lovable focuses on innovation over optimization, how they’ve shifted from activation to building new features, and why giving away their product for free has become their most powerful growth strategy.

*We discuss:*
1. Why 60% to 70% of traditional growth tactics no longer apply in AI
2. Why you have to re-find product-market fit every 3 months
3. The specific growth tactics driving Lovable’s unprecedented growth
4. Why giving away product is a growth strategy that beats paid ads
5. “Minimum lovable product” as the new standard (not minimum viable product)
6. Why activation now belongs to product teams, not growth teams
7. Whether you should join an AI startup (honest tradeoffs)
