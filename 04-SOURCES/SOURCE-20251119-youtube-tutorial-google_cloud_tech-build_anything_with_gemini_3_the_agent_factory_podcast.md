## Description (no transcript available)

Gemini 3 is finally here! Gemini 3 Pro can bring any idea to life with its state of the art reasoning and multimodal capabilities.

It tops the LMArena leaderboard with a breakthrough score of 1501 Elo. It demonstrates PhD level reasoning with top scores on Humanity’s Last Exam (37.5% without the usage of any tools) and GPQA Diamond (91.9%). It also sets a new standard for frontier models in mathematics, achieving a new state of the art of 23.4% on MathArena Apex. 

Google also launched Antigravity, our new agentic development platform. While the core is a familiar AI powered IDE experience with the best of Google’s models, Antigravity is evolving the IDE towards an agent first future with browser control capabilities, asynchronous interaction patterns, and an agent first product.

In this video, learn how to build anything from agents, websites and even an agentic workforce with co-hosts Smitha Kolan and Vlad Kolesnikov and guest Brandon Hancock.
