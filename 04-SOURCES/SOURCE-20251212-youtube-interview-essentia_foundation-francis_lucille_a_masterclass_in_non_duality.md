## Description (no transcript available)

Francis Lucille, originally trained in mathematics and physics, is a contemporary spiritual teacher in the Advaita Vedanta tradition, highly regarded for his clear and experiential articulation of non-duality.
 
In this conversation with Natalia Vorontsova, Lucille explains that Advaita Vedanta is grounded in a single axiom: there is only one reality, which he equates with consciousness. The apparent multiplicity of selves, worlds, bodies, and minds is an appearance arising within this one consciousness. An important value of Advaita Vedanta, in the myriad of idealist spiritual traditions, is that it focuses not so much on achieving altered states of consciousness, but rather offers a method to recognize that consciousness is the single, universal reality.
