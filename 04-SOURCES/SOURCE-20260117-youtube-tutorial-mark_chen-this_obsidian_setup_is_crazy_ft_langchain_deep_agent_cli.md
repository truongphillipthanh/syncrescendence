## Description (no transcript available)

Obsidian isn’t just for notes.

In this video, I turn Obsidian into a real AI agent system using LangChain—where notes act as memory, links become structure, and agents can reason and act inside a knowledge graph. We are going to use PARA from Building your Second Brain to demonstrate how it gonna work!

This is a practical setup for builders who want AI workflows that actually scale beyond demos. I’m Mark Chen — AI researcher, founder of Mindify AI, and CS student focused on agent systems and applied AI.
