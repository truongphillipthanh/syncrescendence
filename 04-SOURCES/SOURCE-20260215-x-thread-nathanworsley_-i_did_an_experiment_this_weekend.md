synopsis: "A CEO sets up OpenClaw on a Mac Mini with full access to WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, filesystem, X timeline, and health data. Concludes AI provides only 10-20% productivity gain for executive decision-making roles, not 2-10x, because it misses context, can't judge importance, and lacks taste for creative feedback."
key_insights:
  - "CEO-level work (context gathering, decisions, vision, morale, stakeholder management) resists AI automation more than execution work"
  - "AI email/message summarization misses critical context - manually checking reveals poor understanding of situations"
  - "Honest assessment: massive unlock for many jobs but executive decision-making roles see modest gains without capability leaps"

# I did an experiment this weekend to see if I could boost my productivity with AI
I did an experiment this weekend to see if I could boost my productivity with AI. I set up OpenClaw on a Mac Mini and gave it full access. It can see my WhatsApp and Telegram messages, read my diaries, browse my entire filesystem, access all my work communications through Slack/Discord, read my X timeline, see the photos I take, and view my Oura ring and Eight Sleep data, et cetera.
I put some safety guardrails in to harden for security. Only I can prompt it; inputs are sanitised, there are various emergency measures and human-gated permissions.
Feels like I have all this power at my fingertips, but I don't know exactly what to actually do with it.
Most of my day-to-day work isn't really the kind of thing AI can help with yet: I gather context and make decisions at the org level, set product vision & strategy through brainstorming and research, coordinate teams and provide morale, report to investors and other key stakeholders.
When I try to use AI to help with this, it misses too much context. It feels like people are exaggerating when they say things like "I just talk to AI instead of reading my emails now". Sure, the AI can read your emails, but it can't effectively figure out what is important and should be reported to you or not, or even summarise what is going on in your inbox without missing things. Whenever you go and manually check your communications, you see it's doing a poor job of understanding the various situations you are involved in. If you try to replace yourself with AI in critical chats, you are just going to piss your coworkers off and reduce productivity.
My current hobbies are working out, producing music, photography/videography, fashion, and writing about philosophical ideas. Not much AI can do here, either, other than create slop, and it doesn't have the taste to give good feedback on artistic pursuits. If I ask about a photograph or a song I've created, I'll get different opinions from different models, and even in different chat contexts, on the same work.
I can definitely see this automating a lot of work for many people, but my job seems completely safe without a massive boost in AI capability. Maybe I'm missing something, but I see more of a 10-20% increase in my productivity as a CEO than a 2-10x increase.
I do, however, think this is a massive unlock. You can't even compare this level of integration to Claude CoWork or existing tools. For many types of jobs, it could definitely be a 10x or more boost in productivity.
I'm going to keep experimenting and staying on the frontier of this.
