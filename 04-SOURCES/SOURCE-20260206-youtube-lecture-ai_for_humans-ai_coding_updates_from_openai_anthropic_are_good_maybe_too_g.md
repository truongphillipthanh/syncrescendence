# AI Coding Updates from OpenAI & Anthropic Are Good... Maybe Too Good?

## Description (no transcript available)

Anthropic drops Opus 4.6. Twenty minutes later, OpenAI fires back with GPT-5.3 Codex. This is the AI agentic coding arms race and it's moving fast.

Both AI models are writing code that can write itself now. OpenAI is using 5.3 to improve its own tooling. Opus 4.6 is "voicing discomfort with being a product." We tested both and break down what actually matters for people building stuff.

Plus Kling 3.0 is out (and harder to prompt than you think), OpenClaw bots are hiring humans on rent-a-human.ai, Roblox launches prompt-to-3D creation, and robots are now doing 130K step challenges in negative 47 degree weather.

THE MODELS ARE IMPROVING THEMSELVES NOW. EVERYTHING IS FINE.
