## Key Concepts

### The Matrix as Technical Singularity
- 1997-1999 represented unique convergence of digital filmmaking tools
- Bullet time emerged from combining robotics, virtual cinematography, and 2.5D compositing
- The innovation wasn't any single technique but their synthesis under creative pressure

### Transmedia Storytelling Architecture
- Stories should exist across media forms simultaneously, not as adaptations
- Each medium reveals unique aspects of narrative universe
- Games, films, installations create unified experiential ecosystem

### AI as Permission vs Efficiency
**Critical Distinction**: AI's primary value isn't doing things faster—it's giving creators *permission* to attempt what previously seemed impossible
- Democratization of ambition more important than productivity
- The bottleneck shifts from execution to imagination
- Tools that lower barrier to experimentation accelerate creative evolution

### Virtual Production Evolution
- Real-time rendering fundamentally changes director-cinematographer relationship
- LED volumes create new hybrid physical/virtual space
- Previz becomes final-viz when compute catches up

## Paradigm-Level Insights

1. **Technical convergences create creative singularities** - The Matrix moment wasn't inevitable; it required specific people with specific tools at a specific moment

2. **AI disrupts permission structures** - The most important AI effect isn't speed but the psychological liberation to attempt ambitious work

3. **Transmedia is native to AI age** - When generation costs approach zero across modalities, stories naturally exist everywhere

4. **VFX history rhymes with AI present** - Same debates about authenticity, craftsmanship, and creative ownership

## Integration Notes

- Connect VFX evolution narrative to TECH_STACK migration patterns
- Transmedia framework relevant to MACROSCOPIC_NARRATIVES content architecture
- "AI as permission" thesis directly supports METAHUMANISM augmentation paradigm


## Transcript

Everyone remembers Neo dodging bullets,
but the real story of the Matrix isn't
what you saw on screen. It's what they
were building behind the scenes. They
weren't just making a movie. They were
creating the tools that would one day
lead to the AI and 3D revolution we see
today with tools like Genie 3 and Unreal
Engine. And the crazy part, this was all
planned 25 years ago. Today we have the
architect to that vision, Shawn Gada,
the visual effects mastermind behind The
Matrix, to explain how a sci-fi
blockbuster secretly laid the groundwork
for our AI future.
>> The Matrix was a cautionary tale. We
don't want to end up being enslaved by
these wondrous, remarkable, and
occasionally potentially dangerous
systems that we're inventing here.
Let's rewind and go back in time. The
Matrix trilogy didn't just employ visual
effects, it redefined them. Starting
with bullet time. John Gada was asking a
deeper question. What does it take to
simulate reality? Those questions didn't
just change cinema, it changed how we
build worlds. We were working on the
very, very first one years before the
first one. Any of you guys saw that,
right? So, we were confronted with
conceptual premises that needed to sort
of match up with the idea of the film,
right? That at some point story could
take place in a flawless simulation. And
the goals of that in movie making terms,
let's say this is the early 90s, early
to mid '90s. Imagine, you know, we're
only so many years down from the vector
graphics introduction of Tron, right?
And it's really not that much time in
the longer scheme of things. So there
were really small building blocks that
were available to think about at that
time. But the main idea was like how do
we essentially believe that these these
characters are in this simulation? And
so traditional what usually begins in
oldtimey Hollywood is you think about oh
what illusion can you create? You know
how do you hack this the idea of this so
that the audience believes it? But it
was different back then for me because
the Wakowskis gave incredible license to
us to attempt some early early
approaches that I guess in these days
would probably never have been allowed
to happen because the risk involved was
was really too high. We're living in a
very risk averse version of Hollywood
now. So essentially what we tried to do
is we tried to figure out okay well
firstly in any simulation would comprise
sources of reality the real world and
essentially some kind of delivery system
that allowed the user participant to
have limitless ability to navigate. So
>> essentially God's eye power among so
many other powers. So we're like okay
how do we get God's eye power on the
screen? How do we imply that? And so it
just the hack of the first film which
was very different than the way we did
the second and third was okay how do we
feel like we can have omniresent
perspective how do we do that and so
that led to just there's no physical way
to uh cheat time and space shooting with
old cameras regular cameras we're going
to need to put a camera everywhere where
perspective needed to be and that
essentially was a hack it's a full hack
>> but I think this is interesting right so
this is the 120 camera like still camera
rig that y'all essentially built to do
do that iconic bullet time shot. And
then is it true that all the there were
certain background sequences where these
are some of the first, you know,
instantiations of photoggramometry or
reality capture
>> on the silver screen.
>> How did that go about? Did you go to
like Sigraph and find a wild Paul Debec
and see his like you know PhD thesis
film or like how did how did all of that
come about? The problem at that time was
it had to be divided between what you
could do in the foreground with the
actors and what everything else was. And
we still, you know, had options like
photographing things as panoramics as or
with motion control systems, robotic
camera systems. But at that time, my
colleagues, they were leading edge
thinkers in graphics were hearing about
some other research going on in
universities. So at that time we looked
around the world at experiments in
universities and other things because so
these ideas you know they're not
necessarily lightning strikes in a
bottle. They're usually there are people
around the world right that are starting
to put some things together and starting
to put together um you know experiments
and uh media labs of a kind I guess
early stage computer graphics labs you
know is where you might find some of
this. So yeah, we found uh a number of
let's call it like uh PhD students and
uh you know Paul Debick over in Berkeley
was close in the neighborhood and so we
were looking at uh some of his work.
Yes, they were thesis films right that
he was putting together and that was a
start point at least with our
relationship with Paul and his amazing
students who wound up becoming you know
very accomplished in their own right
across the years. That was our first
thought right was to essentially move
towards an image-based rendering
approach. First time it was experimented
with for movies I think uh amongst other
things in in those days. So those that
was the foreground and the background
plan and uh yeah over time that that got
deeper. Okay, I can't stress this
enough. This was not a stunt. It was a
shift in capturing reality. A new
language of perception where you can
capture the dynamic physical world in
all its glory. And they did it in a way
that just hadn't been done before. First
Matrix, especially when they were making
it. This is like right around Jurassic
Park, right? So, this is perhaps the
first time people had seen like a CG
dino, like a CG character. But y'all
didn't stop there with the Matrix,
right? Matrix 2 and three then pushed a
bunch of other boundaries. What was that
experience like when you finished the
first Matrix? You unlocked a whole new
category of shots, shall we say, a whole
new category of visual effects, and then
you got two more ahead of you. Were you
like, "Ah, we got to keep pushing
further." Was it always in your mind
that the Matrix film was sort of like a
prototype for what we'll be able to
achieve practically in the future with
real technologies?
>> What I would say here is that there is
this relationship between writing
intellectual thinking, science fiction,
I guess you could say, for various uh
entertainment media. But it's that the
imagining of dreams if you will right of
people of humans that I think are the
first bit of catalyst that can trigger
essentially like the actualization right
of the ideas in the hands of engineers
brilliant engineers inventors these days
could be AI right that sort of manifest
these things
>> but the
>> it almost becomes like a road map or
prototype that builders can look at
>> that is right and so this idea of kind
of mind over matter, mind over matrix.
At least this ability to have power
unmatched by any physical limit, right,
that we have in the real world, right?
This attractiveness that the Wakowskis
sort of had figured out, right? Like how
to create some kind of like fantasy
fulfillment, you know what I mean? If
you dream about being in a comic book,
right? All these things. And but that
the one of the things that virtuality
and simulation and all of that could
potentially give us is this sort of
feeling of limitlessness, right? Yeah.
We were of course in the movie business
back then, but we were also incredibly
compelled and stimulated by the actual
premise of what was going on in the
story that we were working on in a very
unusual way, right? Like not just like,
hey, this is a gig. We're going to we're
going to be these service people that
are going to figure out how to do the
standard hack and illusion, make a shot
if you like to problem solve. You know,
visual effects is a wonderful place to
go and you know and to try to do that.
But but this was a lot more for us and
it actually started putting the whole
cabal of collaborators kind of on this
path on this road map. We would walk
that for decades at that point, right?
Because not only us were like lit up by
the ideas, but like all sorts of people
that saw the films right around the
world literally thinking about little
building blocks of the in in their own
way. When we got to the next two films,
you know, we were thinking, okay, well,
we want to get a lot more ambitious with
this idea, right? We started to taste
the beginning of uh a way to essentially
universally capture which we we called
it universal capture. We we we were just
starting to dip our toes in the water of
how to capture reality. Of course, there
are so many limits compared to what
we're walking towards now, right? At the
moment, at that time, it was essentially
creating a sculpture, right? It was like
a it was sort of a capture of a a moment
in time and everything else that you
needed to do to make it appear to be
alive and dynamic, right? Because a
movie is a a movie is a sculpture. It's
it's not like a you know, a simulation.
And so uh so we were focusing on okay
what is the best sculpture and how do we
you know do certain things to give you
that sort of mind over matrix feeling.
So that came mostly with the virtual
cinematography, the camera work and all
that to give you that feeling, you know,
in the first movie putting a camera in
nearly every frame uh with the exception
of uh state-of-the-art interpolation
which never had occurred before at that
time. But the sequels for the Matrix, I
mean essentially we wanted to level up.
So we at that point we jettisoned all
the stills and we replaced them with the
you know five only known existing
highdeaf cameras in the world which
George George Lucas had three of them
made you know pan vision made the others
so these stitched together heads and
bodies they were just prototypes early
versions of metahumans that you see
today in high-end video games and all
the digital doubles that you see in
Hollywood
>> that experience like where you know for
Matrix Resurrections y'all worked on The
Matrix Awakens, this game that was
tightly coupled to the release of the
movie, made entirely in Unreal Engine
with your friend Kim. And heck, it's
funny. It's like, and then you all like
kind of open sourced all the assets for
it. Heck, I've made a viral Tik Tok set
in that fake amalgamation of New York,
LA, what have you, which of course is an
asset that I would have never modeled
from scratch myself, but now that's like
a public common asset that people can
use. So, it's perhaps a crude
instantiation of other people going
inside the world and telling their own
stories, but what the hell was that
whole experience like to go from making
visual effects for the Matrix to making
a real time rendition like a real-time
instantiation of the construct?
>> That's a it's a good question. I mean
the old posi you know from the film
making days they were I mean a lot of my
colleagues were restless you know and
they did not really want to spend that
much time gigging for big studios um
like a machine you know like being part
of their machine I wasn't really as
interested in that I of course we like
storytelling but like
>> not the conveyor belt of new movie 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 Yeah you can separate ate these
things in terms of like the the
experience of the story uh and all that
we had with that but then you can just
step outside and say uh walking through
the years of the Hollywood you know
complex and all that it's become so my
friends you know started wandering into
like uh AAA gaming wanting wanting to
sort of build worlds that didn't stop at
the end of a movie they wanted to build
persistent worlds you know everyone like
gaming per se so they wanted to work in
that area as well because it was very
exciting training across these two
decades moving towards AAA and all sorts
of remarkable things. Others wandered
into the into labs in Silicon Valley,
you know, uh media labs that spend a
decade before we've even seen half the
things that actually are in our hands
now. Uh but but there's been
experimentation, right? And to me, I was
like, I quickly realized that uh the
things that visual effects and science
fiction seen in movies that inspired in
labs that we've never that most of us
never get a chance to see. You maybe
have seen some of this, but like it's a
move well beyond, right, just conjuring
illusion, right, for you know, fixed
fixed shots in a movie. Anyway, to get
back to the awakens thing. So, the thing
that uh Kim and I didn't really expect
was that the another movie would even
someone would think of making another
one. you know, Lana decided she had a
sort of epiphany and wanted to tell
another story. We were so down the road
with other interests of ours in these
other media landscapes. At any rate, we
were like [clears throat] not really
ever going to do visual effects again in
that way, right? And but we still loved
the whole family, if you will, right? Uh
that made the films. We were all
together for years and we're like love
to still really do something and
participate. So we started thinking
about like okay what would we like to do
this version of ourselves but you know
back in this universe and for me and for
Kim we were mostly you know we're like
well okay you know considering that you
know the in the first set of films we
were trying to figure out how to
approximate you know uh primitive
methods that might lead towards the
ideas that the film was really about.
>> Yeah.
>> Right. So we like
>> kind of faking the construct if you
will.
>> Yeah. And we zoom for, you know, we're
zooming two decades later and, you know,
Kim is literally reinventing graphics
with Tim and the Unreal Engine, changing
everything to to such that like one
could imagine, right? Playing inside of
cinematic worlds, right? They they're
moving in this direction, right? I think
that's because of a fusion and a
convergence of different kinds of people
into that company, right? Fortnite.
Imagine a day when the ideas of Fortnite
are sort of as well cinematically real.
Take these steps, right, where you're
like, "Oh, they're video games. Oh, we
can only go so far with the limit of
serving real-time graphics to multi, you
know, hundred people, etc." Keep zooming
down the line and eventually you end up
at cinematic realism and all sorts of
things that you can do in a social play
environment. When the Matrix
Resurrection project came back, Kim and
I were like, well, what really would we
want to do given what we did and what we
were thinking? So, we're like, we want
to actually figure out a way to step
inside the matrix, right, in the best
way that we could, you know, circa 21 or
two. So, we're like, okay, well, it's
also that's where my head went. And so
with some other colleagues what we were
thinking okay well why don't we plot out
other instantiations of experience and
media that we could get inside right and
have so it was a much more ambitious
than what actually ended up happening
but what we're thinking is that like
well why wouldn't you want to step
inside and see story right perhaps in
one form factor like bounded by editing
and feeling again passive and
two-dimensional and then unlock that and
explore and then play right and do
whatever have adventures inside the
story world. So we thought okay we'll
try to create a virtual backlot to use
that old time and again remember some of
the like the Mandalorian like some of
the people are also involved in in this
whole group that I was working with
slightly adjacent to the movie. Yeah,
they also before they left Lucasfilm set
up all of the the formula and elements
of the mand the way they did the
Mandalorian and triggered that whole
virtual production virtual backlot uh
phase that has been going on. Anyway,
same people, right? Like so old timey
Matrix Posi goes gets bored of movie
business reinvents realism in AAA gaming
takes a couple of other side steps at
changing the way that movies can even be
made with virtual production virtual
backlot.
>> Suddenly it was no longer about
simulating a moment. It was about
stepping into a living world. The Matrix
wasn't a movie. It became a medium and
opened the possibilities for the future
and inspired countless many to come,
including Kim Leiri, now the CTO of
Unreal Engine.
>> So with Kim and I, we were like
basically, okay, let's set up beautiful
demonstration of possibilities, right?
Playing in a cinematic world. It wasn't
really multi-user, but the implication
was that it could be, right? But like
the the sort of absolutely mesmerizing
possibilities of rendering graphics
inside of unlike anything anyone had
ever seen before. I mean you could zoom
down to a tiny little spot in the world
and sort of like fixate on it. And it
was it was as close to photo realism as
anything had achieved up to the time
>> and it was brimming with life, right?
You had like traffic systems, you had
people walking on the sidewalks.
>> So they were like experimenting with all
kinds of procedural and and generative
approaches. a lot of experimentation in
there by that group, but it wasn't only
supposed to be a demo, right? So, we're
like, okay, this is convenient. We'll
build this thing and I'll we'll use this
plus more to actually set up a new set
of entertainment. So, I was working on
uh developing a new origin story
actually that would come in through the
the banner of the Animatrix, right? So
we were actually we were writing what we
thought could be a series that would be
renewed version of the animatrix but we
would use some of these backdrops that
were that the epic people were working
on for for this purpose. People should
demand that they that we go back into it
because to me I think it would be more
interesting than anything but it was the
setting of the story was more or less
like 20 years from now 10 years from now
let's say even 10 years from now. So
it's basically what we're all doing
here, right? What we're talking about
here with about 10 years more maturity
maybe,
>> right? And that was basically the
precursor to the Matrix, right? This
would be like the times, right? And it
would be um a series in which the
construct was used to connect the times
of Neo during a time when Neo was
essentially lost, right?
>> There's a you know, he disappears off
the scene for a while. So during this
time and Lana is a part of this
storytelling, she's building up some of
the formulaic pieces in this this
animatrix 2.0 matrix um prequel kind of
thinking. And uh so basically during
this the times of when Neo is lost,
they're trying to basically go back to
the beginning even before the Matrix to
understand if there's some kind of clues
there that would help them find where he
might have gone or be. Right? what kind
of you know digital ether has he sort of
slipped into because they don't believe
that he's really gone right they they
they think that he's in some realm of
existence right that is uh not
understandable at the time so the idea
would be to essentially use the
construct to time travel in through
simulation back to the pre-matrix time
which we were setting at about 10 years
from now in terms of the real world like
the trajectory that we're on
>> so you had the tech you had the story.
What was the 20th century thinking that
you ran up against?
>> In the 20th century, you needed to have
a successful movie before you would ever
think of launching any other kind of
media. And you would do nothing. It
would sit on your hands or make anything
happen to try to converge, you know,
fundamental pillars of your operation
that should be talking to each other. M
>> for example, there is no reason I can
think of why the original creators of
remarkable stories, usually in the form
of scripts and movies, should not be the
exact same people that are have their
hands into development of the
interactive counterparts.
>> Sure.
>> Right. Like that that is really old
world thinking,
>> right? We'll wait two or three years and
then tap a group that had nothing to do
with the original origin of the universe
to go and try to figure out how to
capture that warm and it's why video
games related to movies have never
worked before because they've isolated
the groups and siloed and this is just
what the old paradigm has been. It
doesn't mean that it can't be done in a
really successful way. I mean Last of Us
was a phenomenal game and it's a
phenomenal series. uh but it took how
many like a decade or whatever.
[laughter]
So my hope is that we can get past that
because technology has enabled us to
potentially think in parallel and
produce in parallel. The only thing
though that we still are up against is
this uh just draconian risk aversion
that you know prevents that kind of
synergistic development and uh
absolutely think that they'll be it'll
be proven by this new wave of creators.
They can create not only stories but
they can create interactive
counterparts. They can they'll soon be
able to create autonomous character
agents that are spun straight from their
movies straight into some kind of play
sandbox. that stuff I think is is coming
into into view. And um yeah, so uh but
it was it was kind of like what stopped
what I thought was really like something
that was as authentic in spirit as it
was in the first movies, right? Like the
things that we were starting to try to,
you know, incubate there could have been
phenomenal. I mean like just basically
this west in a way it's a very
westworldly kind of thinking process
like step inside that story interact see
the sculpture if you want but then
wander off see it you know in different
formats this one's this one's aa gaming
kind of vibe you know or social gaming
vibe this one is an immersive vibe but
they're all basically hub back to the
same foundational which is what the way
we were thinking about it with Unreal at
the time is like well we'll use this
right this is going to be a multimodal
media engine,
>> right? That's going to and based on what
kind of experience you want.
>> In other words, the Matrix didn't just
stay a movie. It became something you
could experience. Stories are turning
into these living, playable worlds, and
we're a part of them, not just passive
spectators.
Fast forwarding to today, AI is flipping
the creative process upside down. You've
got all these generative tools like
Google's V3, Sora 2, Runway, and they
let anyone build cinematic stories. But
the question remains, where does all of
this lead?
>> The advent of Genai as a filmm tool is
really going to cause a big bang of
original storytelling on a scale we've
never seen before. And I can only think
that that is a huge positive, you know,
development. I mean, I think that we're
heading into a diff a new version of a
golden age, you know, for storytelling,
you know, I don't know if it's a golden
age of Hollywood, but it's a new golden
age, right, for for expression. And uh,
of course, you know, I'm not saying that
a virtual sea, rising sea of new content
will make will be good. There'll be all
sorts of things, but but from that
there'll be just a remarkable, you know,
sort of new huge
uh uh spectrum of creative voices and
stories and and worlds, you know, that
need to be, you know, found by audiences
of all kinds. I'm excited by it. I'm
like completely excited by it. And I
would look at the next, you know, couple
few years as really a foundational time
for whatever we do beyond that. It's
going to there's a new foundation being
laid out. And I think that creators or
people who are creative, I mean, there's
nothing more, let's say, fulfilling at
the deepest level than being able to
achieve making something like actually
getting, you know, your story told or
get some piece of content made. It
changes you inside, right? Like if
you're able to do it like in the old
days working on movies or or series or
whatever, these are or games. I mean
these are multi-year battles to get to
the other side like okay you got a dream
you know you've got your dream on paper
you know typed out digital you've
drawing things right to get all the way
across you know to the completion the
moment of completion it takes all that a
person has and you know whether they're
professional or you know they're just
doing it out of passion and uh you know
because it's complicated it's it's
really really not simple right to make
any You could be making a short film as
a student and this is a huge endeavor.
It's a huge lift, right? So the fact
that Gen AI is going to enable people to
get to the other side faster because
what they're making essentially is, you
know, they're expressing something.
They're, you know, they're creating a
world out of nothing to get to the other
side. Being able to do that, I mean,
okay, that changes a person inside the
creator. Not only do they give birth to
it, but they're also doing something for
themselves. And then now you know the
ability to do that and iterate so
rapidly means that I mean again I'll go
back to the old paradigm theurs the
masters that we've seen in film
television game right each time they
make a new work I mean they become ever
more masterful right they just learn so
much more every single time it causes
huge evolution to them as creators but
also you know to the art form okay
movies you know always advancing
television Everything is always
advancing each time these creators get
an iteration out, right?
>> So, you know, the Gen AI, okay, yes,
it's not perfect now, right? There's
lots to be uh thought through,
>> but the pace of iteration, right, is
like a hyper acceleration
>> of the individual too, the human author.
>> Sure.
>> Right. They're they're moving towards
they're they're starting out already
amplified. they're going to end up super
amplified. And so I just think not only
is it interesting that we've unlocked
we're going to unlock millions if not
billions of voices that have been
constrained, but from even that we're
going to see some really very
interesting talent rise out of that.
Power to iterate is one thing that means
you can keep, you know, putting things
out there.
>> In a sense, this is beyond efficiency.
Oh, I can just do more visual effects
with less time and a smaller team. It's
really about permission. Suddenly, you
can bypass all the gatekeepers and turn
your vision into reality.
>> Despite those milestones I've been
blessed to cross through with friends
and colleagues, it is so complex and
difficult to actually get back and
resourced to be able to do those sorts
of things where it has been up to this
time, right? to have real autonomy and
to be able to not have to abide by a
labyrinth of rules, restrictions,
whether it's brand based autocracy,
right? Brand autocracy, corporate
autocracy, right? But what you have to
do, what a creator has to do to get the
resource right to do those things up to
this point has really broken and been
the best and brightest creators
regardless of where there this is not a
indie creator problem. This is not like
a hey I'm going to try to make it. No,
that's not that. You can take this
problem, you can talk about this problem
all the way up to Martin Scorsesei,
[laughter] right? Or anybody you can
think of, right? The creator creators of
the greatest games of our times, right?
You can like what individuals have had
to do to try to be able to get their
authentic vision out has been incredibly
painful. And it's not there isn't a
productive relationship one can have
with producers because the constraints
are not saying that all constraints are
bad. Some constraints really allow you
to refine and make the best of all
things, right? Because you some
constraints really make you think harder
and the problem solving makes the
product be better, right? But as you you
triage things that are not as good. I'm
not talking about that. I'm mostly
talking about gatekeeping, right? So, I
thought after all these years of trying
to work on my own projects, I'm like,
"Okay, I've I've got so many friends and
colleagues with immense talent that
should be like commanding huge fan bases
and having successful careers that just
couldn't get backed by these
gatekeepers." What I thought I would do
is I would set up a platform that was on
its face, it looked very familiar,
right?
>> Almost like Netflix or something.
>> Yeah, it looks like a Netflix or an HBO.
looks like a prestigelike streamer, but
in fact, it's filled with radical
entertainment. It's filled with people
who are pushing limits that don't really
have any opportunity to push up. It's
very they're going to go into the
grinder, right, and walk the coals to if
they're going to ever get there. Right.
>> Right.
>> Maybe they'll get there through uh, you
know, a whole bunch of convoluted things
that they'll go through and lose their
shirts and lose control of their IP and
all of the standard stuff that all the
creators know about. Right. Right. No
matter who you are,
>> it's like yes, this process of
[laughter] being ground up, right?
Losing control,
>> truly selling your soul to make
something.
>> Yeah. You sell you sell your soul and
then you got you get your pennies and
you make your thing and maybe everybody,
you know, if you're lucky, it gets
through and that's great, but most
people have a hard time with that. The
other side of the coin is just trying to
get discovered again, right, in a sea of
media blips that like, you know, that
large social platforms. I'm not against
them. I I like that they let anybody in.
I mean, I think that's great, but to get
discovered means again bending yourself
to algorithms, doing all sorts of crazy
things, you know, and then again being
also warped by like having to, you know,
sell or do things in order to even get
funded for that. So there's
>> Right. This amazing piece of art brought
to you by World of Tanks.
>> Exactly. [laughter]
Yeah. So, which is not a bad game
actually, but
the thing is the thing is is that like
uh I mean, and I'm not trying to sound
utopian or over idealistic, but like I
thought it would be great to have a
platform where uh you know, you could
see just original things, right? And I'm
interested not I don't I don't really
care about the I do care but I don't
have the bandwidth to think about the
problems of the movie and entertainment
business or the visual effects business
and all of the sort of
>> uh pressure and anxiety to do things
cheaper, faster, bigger, right? That are
crushing in on everybody.
um and and causing near systemic
breakdown like a seizure. not just
visual effects but all across all across
entertainment is is suffering a seizure
due due to this risk aversion and at the
same time you have geni coming and like
is that a threat or is that basically
empowerment right and so what I would
like to see is the empowerment end of
the equation manifest somewhere oh here
a person a bright person that hasn't
been able to get you know a chance in a
break it could be even a very
established person who's got a stack of
scripts collecting dust that are
fantastic and they're just nowhere,
right? Because they're just being
rejected. That person needs a venue,
right? And you know, you could put on
YouTube, you could try to walk the
coals, but you could also, you know, get
it on Escape, right? And uh at least
have a place where it's a respectful,
beautiful presentation of this thing you
made. And so we're trying to build up
everybody on escape is actually invited.
It's curated, right? We c curate people
not media. So it's like oh interesting
person you should have a channel. We
know that you're gonna fill this channel
with interesting things and then we will
through a program we will programming we
will you know surface surface things and
curate and uh yeah and so we call it neo
cinema because there's a lot of people
not just geni people there's people use
game engines people use use really
unusual forms of capture. It's neo
cinema. It's new cinema. It's like
whatever emergent enabling technology
you needed to get right these stories
told. And then we will be opening up an
interactive branch also this year in 25.
Yeah.
>> Very exciting.
>> Later in the year.
>> Oo, that's super exciting. Yeah. So,
it's like it is it has the best elements
of kind of what Vimeo used to do in the
early days, creating really interesting
pieces of content that may never have
made it through like sort of the YouTube
al algorithmic gauntlet. But at the same
time, yeah, your focus on creators and
like I know a bunch of the creators that
are on your platform are literally at
the bleeding edge of generative AI, of
like real time film making, all this
different stuff. Now, it may be correct
to say if bullet time or universal
capture broke the notion of space and
time. Escape breaks the mold entirely.
It puts the tools and distribution in
your hands. You don't need to pitch to a
gatekeeper. You just publish a world and
cater to your own audience.
All right. So, we've got all these
tools, but what comes next? John isn't
just dreaming the future. He's building
it, and he's got an opinion on it. A
future where AI, gaming, and movies all
come together in this unique experience
that impacts both creation and
consumption.
>> Massive social media platform side.
>> The problem is discovery, right? It's
sort of like I'm in a little rowboat and
I'm on literally on the ocean, right?
Trying to
>> like a tsunami even. where is, you know,
where are the things of value that I
need, right? I think we're going to
replace the uh really clunky, you know,
ill-working recommendation systems with
very very powerful systems that can help
us find things. I always thought that
curation is really the the inevitable
way to find things in that ocean. It's
curation through trust, right? Like if I
trust the curator because the curator
has demonstrated that we have
like-mindedness, right? I'm aligned,
right, to their taste, then I'm going to
find more and more things of value
through that curation. The question is,
can you find your way to that the right
curator, right? Or can you just find
your way to the content because you've
got some onboard six sense to find that
stuff? intelligent curator is just one
answer for the question of what do you
do when we're flooded with a sea a sea
of media you know made by all those
newly enabled voices okay great I'm glad
everyone's enabled everyone right but I
still now need to figure out right
what's going to something that could I
resonate with me
>> and this is very true right like yeah
the the volume and velocity which books
are being authored movies TV shows music
just every modality you can think of
there's just way more of it there ever
has been. And you're seeing people react
in two fashions. One is like what has
stood the test of time to your point
about, you know, like the greats, you
know, whatever their art form might be.
They've kind of stood that like people
are still reading Shakespeare, right?
Like or some modern instantiation of
Shakespeare or whatever. That's one
thing. It's like go back to basics. Go
back to the stuff that was relevant a
decade ago. Then on the other hand is
like novel for forms of kind of yeah
like curation essentially finding some
of this content whether it's on you know
X or LinkedIn or YouTube and u you know
experiencing it like um but don't you
think this is inherently the deck is
stacked against you know the the favor
of creatives because the volume of
creation is only going to go up and the
number of people are you know going to
grow at a steady clip but we only have
24 hours in a day and as much as the
social media industrial complex is going
to try and make sure that we spend even
more.
>> So yeah, I mean there is definitely an
emerging tech entertainment complex
coming.
>> Yeah.
>> And it is maybe going to be an
unfortunate moment in the future when
the tech monoliths put the entertainment
mini monoliths in their back pocket, you
know, and but they will at some point
and then we're serving a new master. But
what I personally think that I need to
be equipped with is a some form of agent
that is in fact my sixth sense that is
bonded to me that has the ability to
peer into the invisible vast you know
bases of the internet and all other uh
sort of realms. What I really want is a
an unconnected
>> a sovereign agent that is truly
>> agent bonded to me, right? That has just
uh incredible uh insights as to what's
surrounding and also able to advise me,
keep me safe, right? Find find things
that are only going to benefit me, be of
value to me across like all sorts of
categories.
>> Now, how crazy is this? the technology
that the first Matrix predicted. By the
time the fourth one came around, you
could actually instantiate a matrix of
your own.
>> I'm really interested in the living
world thing, right? I want worlds to
just be persistent. The funny thing
about this stuff is like I mean, you
know, you've been it's like we've talked
a lot about these concepts the last
decade, maybe longer, right?
>> But we haven't really quite seen them
right there at our fingertips, right, to
frictionlessly uh experience. But
they're absolutely on on on route,
right? Like so
>> the idea that I could decide to tap into
a world that somebody has essentially
provided some kind of DNA blueprint DNA
might not be the some formulaic
blueprint. In this world, these things
happen. You know what I mean?
>> And you know, here are the kinds of
subgroups, you know, of character
inhabitants, right? That you could meet
just like video game design, right?
>> Yeah. Yeah. Like or the narrative
division in Westworld, right? Like kind
of that level of abstraction.
>> Yeah. And so you Yes. Exactly. And
that's why like actually some people
will do much better than this than
others. Some people just have brain,
right? The instincts for how to world
build, how to design
>> formula. Um and that may be as far as I
mean you start there, right? And then
maybe once you know you've got the rules
I guess inside that you could if you
chose to you could tell stories or carve
your own story because you're walking
through it in a way. So like Westworld's
good example like imagine you
essentially design a Westworld like
simulation that only appears if you have
mixed reality. I mean like if you really
want to get deep inside like mix you
know it's like okay we'll just use we'll
just use AI we'll just use agents and
mixed reality and basically design
something that runs like Westworld. The
point being is that you were kind of
like bringing up the idea of where does
the map where does the territory go in
the future. We called it magic verse
doesn't matter what it is. It's just
basically like we start layering in
rules-based world scenarios and
situations on top of the map and then we
start having interactions with
characters in situations that may have
they're either only running along lines
along the lines of the rules or maybe
you know there is some kind of invisible
author right that's kind of conjuring up
a scenario that you're walking into. At
any rate though like the experience you
know is a story right so I the path that
I walk through is the same as a
sculpture in my opinion like a movie is
essentially a sculpture you walked along
a path and there was a timeline and yes
it was sort of crafted by a particular
person a director writer but there's no
reason why you couldn't you know expect
that you know the paths walked by people
through the unstructured version of that
world with that kind of dynamic wouldn't
be compelling. They could be extremely
compelling. And so I do think that we we
could potent, you know, you brought up
like uh you know, whether you follow an
influencer, right? Like let's not use
that word. Let's just say an engaged a
very engaged person that wants to sort
of you know uh actually accomplish some
goals or discover or explore something
right in the story world. So that could
be depending on how interesting that
person is and how they approach it,
right? Or them and their friends, right?
Yeah, then that could be something very
fun to watch and or you know even tag
along, right? You could imagine people
tagging along. Um not if if it's in a
mixed reality sense, of course that's
different, you know. Uh but um but I
could absolutely see this happening in
like uh you know more like virtual
depictions. So like yeah, it was based
in the real world, but then it was
hybridized with this story stuff. Um and
then uh we walk through the simulation
like a video game. you know we you know
basically walk the path as if we were in
a video game and that's an interesting
story by the end by by the end right or
pieces of it right and we can share that
like memories um it's not far out
fanciful imaginings I mean this is
something that I think the technology
is close to beginning it's close to it's
it's going to deliver on this in this
inside of this decade
But if science fiction becomes modern
infrastructure, then power and danger do
come with it. We're no longer just
watching a movie. We're living inside
its consequences. The code that once
simulated danger on screen is now
simulating truth, identity, and even our
perception of reality.
>> The Matrix was a cautionary tale, right?
Yes, it was wrapped in a lot of
interesting comic book anime like
foundation, but underneath it, of
course, is a cautionary tale. We don't
want to end up being enslaved by these
wondrous, remarkable, and occasionally
potentially dangerous systems that we're
inventing here. We want to make sure
that we improve humanity, not risk it
all, and take people in the other
direction. There is a certain like
psychological warfare that seems to
always be going on uh through the media
whatever stage of the media we happen to
be talking about whether it's propaganda
you know during world wars or whether
it's you know much more subversive uh
you know in social media I mean there's
a lot of that uh to be aware of because
the intent is to influence people so
that another group has some form of
advantage and I don't agree with that at
all and I I think that is the um that is
the immediate concern that we're walking
into right now. There's a big difference
between that and um intended
disinformation sole purpose of hurting
people that unfortunately is just going
to be unleashed upon us. It's already
starting right like you know we're going
to move from you know proofs,
prototypes, tests, you know what I mean
about what's technically possible with
Gen Gen Vid and all um to very
deliberate campaigns. I mean it's
already kind of beginning, right?
disinformation campaigns.
>> And let's be clear, this isn't some
long-term threat to the future. This is
happening right now. Deep fakes twist
our faces. Disinformation rewrites our
history. Elections, movements, trust is
rewired by invisible code that's hard to
even inspect. The simulation isn't
coming. It's here. And the scariest
part, we've stopped noticing. We're like
a fish in water.
In a sense, the Matrix didn't just
imagine the future. It rewired the
ambitions of an entire generation. I'm
talking coders, filmmakers,
technologists, designers, heck, even
myself. Look at these cheesy videos I
made as a 12-year-old inspired by what I
saw inside the Matrix. We all saw a
world built from scratch and asked
ourselves, "Why not me?" So, the
question isn't just what comes next.
It's how do you thrive in this new world
order?
>> When we made the Matrix trilogy, you
know, we were making movies. We were
creating the illusion right of a future
world where one could step into flawless
simulation. But we did a few things. It
turned out to be the kernels right of
things that would grow into where we are
today which is being at the precipice at
the literal inflection point where we
will in fact walk inside of simulations,
story worlds, social worlds on a level
that has only been thought about in
science fiction. We are almost there.
Today, we have all the tools to be those
worldbuilders. In a sense, we're not
just watching the story unfold. We're
creating this new mythology together,
literally manifesting this world into
reality. That's where the story gets
really exciting. The conversation
doesn't just end here. I want to know
what you think. What does the future of
entertainment look like to you? Leave
your answer in the comments below. And
that's the discussion we want to have.
