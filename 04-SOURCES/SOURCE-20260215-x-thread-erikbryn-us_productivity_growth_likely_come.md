# X Thread: US Productivity Growth and AI Benefits
US productivity growth is likely to come in at about 2.7% for 2025.
That is nearly double the average of the previous 10 years.
There are many factors at work, but part of the story is that businesses are finally beginning to reap some of AI's benefits.
I discuss the latest evidence in my column in the [@FT](https://x.com/FT) this morning.
