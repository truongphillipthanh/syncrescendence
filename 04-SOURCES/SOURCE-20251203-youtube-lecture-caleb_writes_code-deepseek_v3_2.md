## Description (no transcript available)

DeepSeek breaks silence and releases their new v3.2 model. Frontier labs like OpenAI, Google, xAI, and Anthropic has been battling each other and this is the first major release made from China as a response.
How does this model fit in the product and market space and how does this technology impact the rest of the industry when it comes to enterprise and business use cases? Will the US comeback with stronger models?
