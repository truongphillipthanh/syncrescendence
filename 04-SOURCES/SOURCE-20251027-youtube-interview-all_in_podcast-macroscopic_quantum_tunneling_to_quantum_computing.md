# Macroscopic Quantum Tunneling to Quantum Computing

## Executive Summary
John Martinis, 2025 Nobel laureate in Physics, describes the 40-year journey from demonstrating macroscopic quantum tunneling in Josephson junctions to achieving quantum supremacy at Google. The foundational insight: billions of electrons can act collectively as a single quantum particle, enabling macroscopic superposition states that form the basis of quantum computing. He projects useful quantum computers in 5-10 years, with drug discovery and materials simulation as killer apps.

## Key Insights

### Macroscopic Quantum Mechanics
The Nobel Prize work proved that large systems (billions of electrons in a Josephson junction circuit) can exhibit quantum mechanical behavior—specifically, quantum tunneling. All electrons act coherently as a single quantum particle, enabling macroscopic superposition states.

### From Tunneling to Qubits
If a circuit can tunnel between two states quantum mechanically, it can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously—the definition of a qubit. Martinis's foundational work enabled the superconducting qubit architecture now dominant in commercial quantum computing.

### Quantum Supremacy Achievement
Google's 2019 demonstration: 53 qubits performing a computation in 200 seconds that would take classical supercomputers ~10,000 years. Controversy exists about classical algorithm improvements, but the principle was demonstrated: quantum computers can solve some problems classical computers cannot.

### Error Rates and Scaling
Current qubits have 1-in-1000 to 1-in-10,000 error rates per operation. Useful computation requires ~1-in-1,000,000 or better. Need to scale from ~100-1000 qubits to millions. Progress is steady on both fronts.

### Drug Discovery as Killer App
Molecules are quantum mechanical systems. Simulating them accurately requires solving Schrödinger's equation for all electrons—exponentially hard classically but natural for quantum computers. Could screen millions of drug candidates computationally before synthesis.

### China Competition Concerns
Chinese labs are publishing results on par with Google shortly after Google publishes. Suspicion that results are held until Western publication, then released simultaneously. US advantage may come from advanced fabrication (300mm tools via Applied Materials) unavailable to China.

### 5-10 Year Useful Timeline
Martinis estimates useful quantum computers—solving real problems classical computers cannot—within 5-10 years. Not replacing classical computers, but complementing them for specific problem classes: simulation, optimization, cryptography.

## Quotable Passages
> "Here was a system with billions of electrons all acting collectively, and they're all tunneling coherently—quantum mechanically tunneling as if they're one particle. This was the demonstration that macroscopic systems can behave quantum mechanically." — John Martinis

> "The computation took about 200 seconds on our quantum processor. We estimated it would take the best classical supercomputer about 10,000 years." — John Martinis

> "I'm worried that the Chinese government is saying, 'You can't publish anything until it's in the Western press, and then you can talk about it.' That's precisely what I've heard." — John Martinis

## Transcript

Welcome. Today uh I'm very excited for
this all-in interview with this week's
Nobel laureate, winner of the Nobel
Prize in physics in 2025, John Martinez.
John, welcome to the all-in interview.
>> Yeah, thanks for inviting me. Um I'm
quite excited about this uh this talk
and uh you know, love to explain to
people about you know, what this prize
is all about.
>> All right, besties. I think that was
another epic discussion. People love the
interviews. I could hear him talk for
hours. Absolutely. Oh, he crushed your
questions in a minute.
>> We are giving people ground truth data
to underwrite your own opinion. What did
you guys think? That was fun. That was
great.
[Music]
>> Well, the Nobel Prize is the most
prestigious honor and particularly in
physics that I think can be awarded.
You're in the record books. It's going
to be an incredible ceremony coming up
for you. Maybe we could go back to the
beginning in your history. I'd love to
hear a little bit about, you know, where
did you grow up and how did you get
started with your interest in physics?
>> Uh, well, so I uh I grew up in San
Pedro, California, and uh, you know,
grew up there my whole time. My my
father was a fireman and my mom stayed
at home, took care of us, and um, you
know, through the years I was always
interested in science, technology. I'm
going to say one of the things is, you
know, my my dad, you know, actually
didn't have a high school education, but
very smart person. He was always
building things in the garage, various
projects. So, I grew up kind of knowing
how to build things, which also kind of
tells you how things work, you know,
kind of empirical view, you know,
tactical view of how physics works. So
uh when I took physics in high school, I
actually loved it because there was
actually some math behind it and
concepts and you know really made sense
to me and uh you know I I just really
you know fell in love with the subject
and then went to UC Berkeley and and did
pretty well there and enjoyed it. Uh
enjoyed it a lot. And then in my senior
year at UC Berkeley I had a class from
John Clark who was my adviser and found
out what he was doing. and he was just
starting to look at these quantum
mechanics and electrical devices stuff
and it sounded really interesting for
me. I guess I have, you know, I guess I
could see maybe when something maybe
would would take off. So I started to to
uh to to do the graduate school work
with him.
>> You went to Berkeley for graduate
school.
>> I went to Gertie for graduate school,
which you're not supposed to do.
>> I was originally a physics and math
undergrad at Cal.
>> Okay. I changed my major later and
actually got my degree in astrophysics.
There was some upper division math class
that really turned me off to math as a
major. There was just so many proofs. It
drove me nuts.
>> Right. Right.
>> And then physics was always exciting,
but I liked uh working in the astro lab
and I worked actually at Lawrence
Berkeley Lab.
>> Oh, okay. Yeah.
>> But then you you stayed at Berkeley and
went to grad school, right?
>> Yeah, I stayed at Berkeley, went to grad
school. We started this project a couple
years into grad school. I forget exact
date. And what was interesting is this
was a question that was actually posed
by professor Anthony Leget who won the
Nobel Prize for you know helium 3 you
know physics uh in I think 20 2003
>> was that super fluid
>> super fluid helium 3. Yeah that's right.
>> So he showed like if you put helium 3
cold enough it kind of almost has this
new sort of characteristic with the
physics and how it moves and how it
works. Well, it has a this super fluid
behavior, but it has a very complicated
behavior because of the more complicated
nuclei of the helium 3. And
>> this had been discovered and people
worked for a while to figure that out.
And he, you know, helped develop the
theory for that. So, he was quite
wellknown, very, very smart person. And
although he won the Nobel Prize for
that, okay, there's not much helium 3
physics going on, but for the question
that led to our experiment, okay,
there's a huge field. And the question
was, do macroscopic
objects behave quantum mechanically?
Okay, and this is a macroscopic object
might be a small ball. In our case, it's
an electrical circuit with billions of
electrons in it, billions of atom and is
the collective motion of say the ball uh
quantum mechanical. Now, you know, if
you think about throwing throwing a ball
against the wall, it's going to bounce
off. But if you make the wall thin
enough and the ball light enough, it'll
then every once in a while tunnel
through because of the, you know, laws
of quantum mechanics. So, um
>> hold on, let's just pause on that for a
second. And I think that's really worth
spending a moment on.
>> Yeah. Great.
>> So when we talk about quantum mechanics,
when we talk about the relative position
or energy or movement of a particle at
the atomic scale as small as an atom or
smaller than an atom, we have to use
kind of probabilities to describe where
things are going to be. That was what
was really kind of the big understanding
of quantum mechanics in the early 20th
century, right? is that there's
>> the probability of things being where
they are and moving as they're moving
there. It's not like like deterministic
like we can see with the ball that we
throw around. When you get very very
small things get very fuzzy and it's
very hard.
>> So you hit upon upon the key idea here
maybe by accident but it's very
important. Quantum mechanics was
developed for the theory of small
things. You know, electrons, atoms, you
know, things things that are that are
the the fundamental constituents of it,
but very small. And um you know, if you
take an atom, it's made from electron
and a nucleus. You know, classically,
they attract each other and they would
just, you know, combine together and
then atoms basically would have no size.
Why do atoms have size? Okay, that you
know that that was one of the the
strange things and it's because this
atom is kind of not a a point particle.
I used to say to my kids that the
electrons were fuzzy. Okay. And and
quantum mechanically it has some wave
function and extended. You can think of
the electrons being all around the
nucleus at the same time. So um it it's
just a very strange behavior u but of
small things uh and of course very
important as how atoms work and how we
describe nature. So quantum mechanics
ultimately became a field that people
say is very non-intuitive in terms of
understanding where small small
particles are, the energy they have,
where they're moving to and and
basically we resolved to figuring out
that we had to use these functions. It's
not just a single point, but it's a
distribution. It's a whole bunch of
places and there's a probability of
where the atom could be or where the
electron could be. It's also a
probability of how fast it might be
moving. All of these things become
probability functions.
>> And you develop a mathematical theory
for doing this that you know takes you
until your third year in university to
really know enough math to understand
that. But basically that's right
>> these are forming waves waves of the
electron. So you have kind of a wave and
electron around the nucleus describing
what the uh the electrons are. And these
are kind of like standing waves, you
know, it's like hitting a string. Uh,
you know, if if different length
strings, different tension strings form
different notes, these vibrations of the
electrons around the atom can vibrate at
different frequencies.
>> So rather than think about an electron
moving around an atom in a predescribed
path and I can know where it is at any
point in time, the right way to think
about an electron around an atom is it's
in a wave. It's a and it's it's a long
there's a wave that describes kind of
where it is and it's doing
>> and you have the electron and you have
the proton
attracting it. So the whole wave theory
combines all those two and you know
gives you a description of how the the
atom works and quite accurate
description too. And so one of the other
kind of features that arises from the
fact that everything at a micro scale is
described by wave functions is that
there's a small probability of something
kind of extreme or extraordinary
happening. Like the one example is
Stephen Hawking figured out that you
could have a particle and antiparticle
come out of nowhere in the middle of
space and the antiarticle goes into the
black hole. The particle shoots off.
>> Yeah. And that the probability of that
happening is so low, but it happens
enough that the antiparticle actually
starts to delete part of a black hole.
And that's how black holes evaporate and
this
>> theory all these interesting things. But
can you tell us how what quantum
tunneling is? So this is another one of
these sort of features of quantum
mechanics that arises from the fact that
these things are kind of waves and
probability functions.
>> Yeah. So if if you have um if you have
an electron just traveling through space
hitting hitting a wall let's say there's
a little wave wave packet wave function
to it. So it's not a single particle. It
has some extent to it. And what happens
is that when that particle hits the
wall,
quantum mechanics say there is some
amount small amount of this wave
function or if you like the particle
going through the wall and then to the
other side.
>> Now most of the time it uh it bounces
off but every once in a while it goes
through. And you know this is seen in um
uh everyday devices. This is not and as
if you build very small um memory
circuit you have to worry about
electrons tunneling and charge leaking
off your capacitor. Uh they have
magnetic memories that depend on these
tunnel junctions. So this is a very
well-known phenomenon and if you make
the this barrier this insulator just you
know 10 20 atoms thick then that's thin
enough for it to go through
>> to go through. So this is what's so
interesting. Um you can actually predict
the number of electrons that might
tunnel through one of these barriers one
of these insulating barriers as they're
called over to the other side which
really is crazy to think about. It's
just like walking through walls, right?
I mean,
>> yeah, that's that's the idea.
>> Yeah. So, going back to the story you
were sharing, you're in grad school,
>> right?
>> And then Leot proposes this idea. Maybe
you can share a little bit more now that
we've got I think a bit of the basics on
what was discussed, which was
>> zooming out a bit like rather than just
think about all of this happening at a
microscopic scale, is it possible for it
to happen at a bigger scale?
>> Yeah. And again we've been talking about
quantum mechanics is the physics nature
at this microscopic atomic scale but the
question was if you made a macroscopic
object would it obey quantum mechanics
also okay and then you know that was the
basic question and it turns out that
there's a very natural system to look at
looking at an electrical system and look
seeing for quantum mechanics an
electrical system where the currents and
voltages of essentially electrical
oscillator does it behave like a
classical physics or does it behave with
this quantum mechanical nature to it?
And that was the question. Now it turns
out that when you think about quantum
mechanics and thinking about well
there's the quantum behavior but then at
some point you have to measure it which
then turns it into a probability.
There's something called the Schroinger
pat cat paradox where um in the paradox
you have your radioactive decay and then
you you you
let it happen for let's say half of the
radioactive decay time and then you say
and then the in you have a ready
detected decay a detector and then a
bottle of cyanide which will kill a cat
and then do you say you know after some
amount of time is the cat in the dead in
the live state. Okay. And you know,
physicists, you know, and this is this
good question. Einstein brought brought
it up or Shoner brought it up. A lot of
people uh discussed it. Uh but Alleged
pointed out that the reason this is a
paradox is you can believe that a
macroscopic object like a cat could be
in a quantum superposition state. And in
fact, there was no experime experimental
evidence that this could happen. And
that was his point. So um so he said
well you know people should be testing
this and let's see if it's true and uh
as a as a young graduate student who
just you know learned about quantum
mechanics and it's like oh that's a
really great great question that's
something that we should try to do and
we should try to do an experiment you
know on on the suggested system uh to
look for quantum mechanics. And the the
original proposal was looking for the
tunneling. Well, it turned out to be
more than that, but uh the it look for
tunneling.
>> Let me just kind of describe another way
is you know the macroscopic system could
be my entire body. Could I walk through
a wall?
>> That's right. And then the probability
of all of my atoms being in the perfect
moment, perfect position, you know, to
to be able to kind of cross through the
wall is so low, it would never happen in
this or many other universes of
>> and and that's the problem is that most
macroscopic objects when you try to
think about the quantum mechanics that
won't happen. Okay. So,
>> right. There's a small probability one
electron can cross over a barrier,
>> but the probability that many cross over
at once is lower and lower and lower and
that makes it very difficult to see at
scale. And what what happens is if you
look at an electrical circuit then the
parameters become favorable for seeing
this kind of macroscopic behavior. And
okay, it's hard to go into the the whole
physics of all that, but it's basically
because you can make a circuit that
operates at microwave frequencies. So
instead of you trying to go through the
wall once a second, it tries to go
through the wall five billion times a
second. Okay. So then it's it's a lot,
you know, more you know, you have more
chances to go through. And uh uh the
other thing is the just the various
parameters that involved in quantum
mechanics you know are favorable for
seeing this kind of phenomena. You have
to do the experiment right but uh it's
favorable for doing that.
>> So one of the parts of your experiment
you created what's called a Josephson
junction. Is that is that correct? So
this is two superconductors with a
barrier between them. Right. I got
really fascinated by superconductors
when I was maybe 12 years old. I I went
and bought a superc conducting disc etum
berium copper oxide. Yes, that's right.
>> From the back of Popular Science and
then I went to UCLA and I got a a jug of
liquid nitrogen
>> and then I floated a magnet above the
disc
>> because of the Meisner effect and I had
it at the science fair and I and I did
very well with the science fair that
year because I showed this really
>> What year was that? Was that when it was
discovered?
>> Must have been 919.
>> Okay. Yeah, that was close enough that
that was good. Yeah, the hard part is
getting the liquid nitrogen. But
>> yeah, and I had a friend whose dad was
like a doctor at UCLA or something like
that, so he was able to get the liquid
nitrogen for our demonstration.
>> Right. Yeah, that that was the hard
part. Okay.
>> I've always been fascinated by the
physics of superconductors and maybe you
can just explain one of these important
features of the of superconductors as it
relates to kind of resistance and
current flow and then we can talk about
your experiment.
So, so what happens is um when a a
material goes superconducting
all the electrons condense into one
state. Okay. Now to just to give you
analogy of how it's not perfect analogy
it's close analogy. If you have a normal
metal any metal we have at room
temperature it's like a gas of
electrons. It's like you know gas in the
air. And then when you get below the
superconducting temperature.
>> Sorry, I think we should just explain
that. So, so you have a metal all the
electrons are kind of moving around.
They're they're perturbed. They're all
different energies, different states.
That's right. Different energies,
different states. You know, there's some
firm statistics. Not go into that, but
it's more or less looks like a gas. You
think of a of a gas and then when you
cool it below you know a certain
temperature it then coaleses into let's
say a solid like like atoms will and the
electrons coales into the something
cooper cooper pair bcs condenset is the
name where all the electrons are kind of
locked together and doing the same
thing. Now the nice thing about that
it's not like they're frozen in place
but they have a free parameter that
allows them all the currents all the
electrons to flow in some direction
which is the supercurren
>> in a superconductor meaning a material
that's cool enough that it reaches its
superconducting critical temperature.
Right? So suddenly all the electrons can
still move. They can still create a
current, but
>> but they're they're moving together like
they're in like in my analogy like
they're in a solid instead of the gas.
>> And because they're moving together,
>> okay, then then when you work through
all the physics, they are not um you
know, they aren't randomly scattering
off things. They're just moving
together. And then you get a supercurren
where for example if you made a ring a
superconductor superconductor that
current would basically flow for forever
around the ring. This is what you saw
with the floating magnet.
>> Right. That's so interesting. I've
always uh thought and there's obviously
been companies started around the idea
of creating an infinite battery where
you could store technically forever
electricity because the electrons are
just moving around. If it's
superconducting it can they can just
spin forever around that circuit. And
people actually do use big
superconducting magnets to store energy.
And when you get an MRI that you're in a
you're in a liquid helium machine with a
a superconducting magnet, they charge it
up and that magnetic field is basically
there forever. Uh you know, waiting for
people to to go inside it. It it's kind
of strange to be in you're inside this
super cold magnet there. But they've
designed it very well. Works well. So
this Josephson junction is two
superconductors. They're on either side
of a barrier that you create, an
insulating barrier. And then maybe just
explain the experiment and and what you
guys measured.
>> And this this was all while you were in
grad school, right?
>> Yeah. Yeah. And and uh and this is this
Jose junction because the Cooper pairs
have to tunnel through it, but they kind
of tunnel through it together without
any loss. This this actually forms
what's called an electrical inductor in
circuit in circuits. So an inductor is
normally a a coil of wire that stores
energy and its magnetic field. Here this
this just stores energy of the electrons
tunneling through here. And so it's a
it's something called we call a kinetic
inductance and it happens with this but
that forms a nonlinear inductance and
with a capacitor in the circuit that
forms an inductor capacitance resonance
circuit which is in your old which is
like in your radios you have filters of
LC resonance circuits to filter your
signal and do anything. So this is a
very common microwave and uh you know
radio frequency uh element that you use
all the time to make electrical
circuits.
>> So I just want to simplify that you have
these two superconductors split by this
barrier. There's some tunneling some of
these electrons are actually going
through the barrier to the other side
and then you can effectively measure all
of these different changes as you change
the temperature. You guys were putting
different voltage states into this
circuit that you built. And what you saw
and what you measured and what you
demonstrated was that there were these
very kind of discrete or specific
changes that happened that basically
demonstrated quantum mechanics at scale.
>> That's right. So, so this inductor
capacitor resonator which you just treat
as a you is a charge and a current going
through but because it's quantum
mechanics there's this wave function to
it. So there's some uncertainty in these
and then given just the way that the
simple electrical circuit works um uh
you can then demonstrate the quantum
mechanics one of the tunneling which is
a little bit hard to describe here but
you can see tunneling but I think the
little bit easier thing maybe easier is
to look at the energy levels of this and
let me kind of explain that when people
discovered you know atomic physics and
started doing any doing this they um
excited a gas of of you know some gas
and the light coming out of that gas
would be at certain colors of frequency.
So if you go outside and you have the
sodium lamps on, these are kind of the
yellow lamps, you have, you know, kind
of a single frequency coming out of that
lamp. Or nowadays you look at LEDs,
there are certain frequencies that come
out of that. And this is a quantum
mechanical effect that the how the
electrons travel around the atom.
There's only certain kind of frequencies
that they oscillate at. Now,
classically, you would expect there to
be all different frequencies that it
spirals around or spirals into the
nucleus. So, that's what you expect. But
we saw these discrete frequencies.
>> And so, by measuring those discrete
frequencies, you now had proof
>> that there was quantum mechanics
happening at a macro scale.
>> That That's right.
>> And you published this work. And was
there a lot of attention when you
published this work?
This was in 1985 86.
>> Yeah. 85 or I actually forget but 85 or
86.
>> And so was there much attention on this
work at the time? 8. Yeah. This was a
big question and people wanted to you
know understand that and you know we
published it in physical review letters
and it got a lot of attention and I
think we had a little article in
Scientific American that was very proud
of
>> that wrote about that and uh yeah it it
was you know it was kind of a kind of a
big deal.
>> What did you go on to do at that point?
Was it considered groundbreaking Nobel
Prize-winning work and what was the
story at that time when this came out?
>> Yeah. So, you know, it was an it was an
important piece of work and people
noticed it, but you know, it it you
know, we we showed that quantum
mechanics worked and quantum mechanics
worked on the macro scale, which was
nice, but one could still, you know,
argue, well, what is it good for? What
are you going to do? And the in fact the
secret of an important scientific
breakthrough
is does it lead to other experiments and
other papers and other inventions and
the like and uh that kind of took uh you
know many decades to happen because it
was so new and people had to do do that.
So I would say it was noteworthy at the
time but you know not necessarily you
know something for a Nobel Prize because
it was just kind of you know weird and
went off and you know what are you going
to do with it?
>> But what happened at the time was very
interesting and at the end of my thesis
time there was a conference in uh UC
Santa Barbara where I came here for the
first time.
>> Yeah. and uh they they were talking
about this experiment but the very last
day the last talk was by Richard Feman
very well-known physicist
>> of course the greatest yeah
>> the great yeah right you know I kind of
idolized him and and read his his his
books and whatever
>> and he was talking about using quantum
mechanics for computation which is
building a quantum computer
>> so he gave a talk that was, you know,
really kind of amazing. I'm going to be
honest as a student. I I didn't quite
catch everything and my Michelle dev my
dear friend said yeah maybe some of the
things wasn't quite figured out at the
time but afterwards he was absolutely
mobbed by people asking him questions
cuz it's so interesting to think about
taking this this you know basic law and
actually doing computation with it
>> right
>> and I was a graduate student so I was
kind of at the outside ring you know you
have the professor professors in close
and whatever and I was just a lowly
graduate student so I could hear a
little bit but what I what I learned
from this it was a great question and
and something that would be kind of
worth doing you know for your your life
pro your life work because it's so deep
and so interesting and maybe practical
and the like so that really motivated me
>> yeah so that big idea is to use quantum
mechanics and these properties of
quantum mechanics to do computing.
>> Yeah, that's right. And and I would say
uh uh soon after that other people in
the field got a little bit more specific
and showed how you would how you would
do it. And then it was in the early
1990s, maybe 5 years later, that Peter
Shaw came up with this factoring
algorithm to to solve a you know, a real
world problem with it.
>> Yeah. And it took a while to people
figure out. It was very abstract and you
know people quite weren't sure what to
do. But but like I said I could see that
in all the the crowd around Fineman
asking them questions that this was the
most you know most interesting
fundamental question you know how to
combine quantum mechanics with doing
computation. It's it's really amazing.
>> And so you started to do that with your
life's work pretty much. you go on to a
very good career.
>> Yeah. So my career path um was of course
quantum computing was getting developed
and and it took me a while to really get
go all in on it. Okay.
>> Yeah. So um what happened is Michelle
Devare was was from France from CA
France went to Berkeley went back I went
there as a posttock and worked with them
and they were young and unknown at the
time and people like well you're going
to go to Europe and you're not going to
get connected to US science but I knew
Michelle and Danielle Eststev and
Christian Abino the people I working
with were absolutely brilliant okay and
they've had a very illustrious a career.
So I went over there because I knew that
was great. And we continued to do
experiments on this.
>> Yeah.
>> And then after that I came back to the
US and I worked for the National
Institute of Standards and Technology.
And it turns out just down the hall from
Dave Wland and his group who went a
Nobel Prize for atomic physics for you
know doing quantum computation. And I
worked on some with doing experiments on
counting electrons and working for
metrology and then did other
experiments. And then in late uh the '9s
I I just again went all in on building a
quantum computer. There was funding
available at that time. It had
progressed enough theoretically that the
US government started you know funding
this to see if people can do it. And so
then couple years after 2014 I think you
ended up at at Google's quantum lab in
Santa Barbara. Is that right?
>> I was at UCSB for um 10 years or so
which was wonderful and built up the lab
to go from very basic things to building
a five and then 9 cubit quantum
computer. And then during that time,
Google got interested and I I kind of
decided that although academia was
great, it would be hard to get the team
together and keep them together for a
long time to build this complicated
machine and Google had the money. Okay.
>> Yeah. So, so we went there and we
started off fairly small uh mostly from
people coming from my UCSB group and
then in uh 2019
we published this quantum supremacy
experiment with 53 cubits where we made
a lot of cubits and we made them really
good and you know fast and whatever so
that we could run some algorithm a
mathematical algorithm that um what it
produced some output uh that was took
you know much much longer on a classical
computer to to emulate and do that. It
was not practical but it was a
demonstration of the power of a quantum
computer
>> that it worked. Well, just maybe give
your description of a cubit and maybe we
can relate, you know, how do we build
these quantum computers from cubits to
the Josephson junction and some of the
early work you had done that you ended
up winning the prize for.
>> So very simply, we have a metal wire and
a metal wire that gets put together on
this Joseen junction which represents a
a an inductor flowing through here. And
then from this wire to this wire, we
have a capacitor.
And then we set that up to oscillate at
about 5 GHz cell phone frequencies.
Uh uh you know to to form the cubit.
Okay, this oscillating thing. And then
there's at low temperatures
superconductors you know all this magic
we can we can get quantum mechanical
behavior out of that
>> and then you can measure that quantum
mechanical behavior create a
representation and use that to run your
computing.
>> That's right. What you can do is you put
on microwave pulses to change the state
of the quantum computer, change the way
it oscillates and then we connect it to
um it's a complicated readout circuitry
uh to you know in the end figure out
what state it's in.
>> Okay. And then and then you you connect
just an array of these and you just use
capacitive coupling from you know one
one wire to the to the next one to to
couple them together and it's more
complicated than that but that gives you
a good idea
>> and then just to understand
your work that you won this Nobel Prize
for that demonstrated this quantum
mechanical phenomena at scale. Is that
part of the design of a cubit and the
circuitry? Did that inform that design
work or explain it rather? Yeah.
>> Yeah. It was the very basic simplest
circuit. uh you know we were using
analog simulators at the time not even
the I took data with a computer but this
is this is far back enough that you know
it was very rudimentary
>> and then over the years we just got more
sophisticated design by the whole field
you know many many people
>> and uh and we were able to put things
together in a way to actually build a
computer now
>> right
>> the the I would say the reason why It's
interesting from the Nobel Prize thing
is what it led to and what it led to
right now is a thousand maybe several
thousand people around the world doing
research to build this superconducting
quantum computer and and it's just
turned into enormous field large number
of papers large number of people people
selling quantum computers IBM is selling
quantum computers people are selling
time in the quantum computers and the
fact that it was a it was a useful idea
okay that led and and and brought into
form uh uh all all these different
experiments ideas and many many people
contributed this
>> I mean it's very interesting and I think
just this broad question or observation
that sometimes
inquisitive minds
leads to research that leads to some set
of discovery that are completely not
apparent until 40 years later. the
effect or the impact it may have had
>> on building an industrial field like
there's now quantum computing everyone
feels is on the brink
>> of actually achieving what people have
talked about in theory for decades but
seems to be getting very close to doing
it and
>> yeah I I can talk on that but I would
say um you know this field many other
ideas on how to build a quantum computer
has been generated and uh it is very
exciting field quite large field and I
would say that the science was very very
deep too. To get these things to work
you have to invent lots of different
devices. You have to think about
materials. You have to fabricate it,
build complex control systems.
Engineering and physics is is to me
quite beautiful. And and just to tell
you a little bit about me, um you know,
I grew up building things and as an
experimentalist,
you know, I like to to build
instruments, you know, build experiments
to show this. And this was kind of the
ideal project for me because, you know,
from very early on it was like, well,
let's, you know, do this great physics,
but let's also build something. And by
saying, well, what do we have to do to
build a quantum computer? that kind of
led me to know what physics we have to
test and what are the kinds of things we
have to build and that's just the way my
mind works. I'm I'm much more
practically oriented. So it was a
perfect field for me to get in and
that's kind of what you know intuitively
led me to you know want to do this in
graduate school. And I think it's just
so fascinating the amount of engineering
and technology you have to do to make
this work.
>> Where are we in quantum computing
evolution today? So what's the state? At
what point will we have call it
generally accessible and generally
useful quantum computers that can do all
of the amazing things everyone's kind of
talked about for decades that one would
be able to do quantum computers.
>> That's right. So um right now we're
we're about 50 or 100 cubits for the
superconducting case but they they can
be fully controlled and run real
algorithms and do very complicated
things. They have a lot of other systems
that can do that. I think the the
newcomer on the block which looks good
is neutral atoms where they've made big
neutral atom systems but they they're
still working to get the gates
controlled really well and the like. But
what's happened right now is we can run
genuine algorithms on that and people
have uh h you know have ideas they want
to run but because these cubits are not
perfect okay you it's an analog control
system and fundamentally these quantum
bits have a little bit of error to it
little bit of noise to it you can only
run so complicated of a project and it's
good enough to write scientific papers
and try things out. Uh, every once in a
while people say they've done something
uh, you know, that's hard to compute and
well that's fine, but they aren't really
big enough to be useful yet. They have
to get bigger and they have to get
better, less noise.
>> Do you have a point of view on the
timelines? This is everyone's
speculation and there's been more hype
than reality.
>> Yeah, there's more hype than reality and
and uh, and it's hard. I used to not
want to speculate that but since I
started a company then I can do that and
what we want to do and it's a timeline
of many other groups is to do something
in let's say in the next 8 10 years
something like that but the problem is
you know people are predicting 10 years
you know for a while now so okay we we
have to do that but um I can tell you
for what we're doing is that we've
identified by what are kind of the
technology bottlenecks of the current
fabric turn ways to make a a quantum
computer. We've written some papers on
it and you know we're working with
people in the semiconductor industry to
manufacture this in a much more coste
effective quality way you know the way
you make these GPUs or something and we
think uh you know when we get that to
work we can scale up very rapidly so in
in a let's say 10year time scale
something like that
>> in a lot of technically difficult fields
like fusion energy perhaps even quantum
computing. They are seeing profound
acceleration
in getting to their crazy big goals on
these very big technical projects
because of AI. Is AI starting to play a
role in solving some of the engineering,
material science, scaling, noise issues
that we've seen historically in quantum
computing? And do you think that there's
an acceleration underway in performance
improvements because of AI? there there
may be um my partic and and and there's
things we can maybe do modeling and the
like. We also think what we can do is
use the quantum computer and AI together
to solve the problems better. So that
that that's what our theory team is
proposing. I used to work with Google
quantum AI. That's what they're
proposing. So there's a general feeling
of that. My particular view though is
that in terms of this control, if you
don't build your system cleanly enough
and you know that the control is clear
enough, uh you're you're not going to
get the the great performance out of it.
So I'm a little bit old school here and
and working on you know building it that
way. There's certainly some elements
where you can use AI,
you know, in the decoding circuit for
the the error correction and the like.
But the one thing to mention to you is
that, you know, these cubits are are
naturally very noisy and you can maybe
do sometimes 100 for bad cubits and
maybe a thousand maybe few thousand
operations before they kind of lose
their memory. You know, you can think of
it as like dynamic RAM where you have to
refresh it. Well, you have to refresh it
with error correction. And because of
that, you're talking about a million
cubit quantum computers to be general
purpose and solve really hard problems.
There might be some
>> a million something. A million is a good
round number for it. Maybe a little bit
more. And right now we're at you know a
hundred or you know a little bit more
than that. So we have a ways to go.
What is your view on China and the
progress that they're making in this
technology versus the US? This is the
topic dour in every field, industrial
field, computing, science is where's
China at compared to the US, the
comparisons and everyone's worried about
the progress in China versus the US and
what that means. So I can talk about my
own field but when I have read the
papers that um duplicated what we did at
at Google on the quantum supremacy
experiment you know they know what
they're doing. I mean they they go
through the theory they talk about a lot
of it is very similar to what we're
doing but they know what they're doing
and they're getting great results. And
the thing that scares me a little bit
is, you know, last December the Google
group published the latest results,
which is really much nicer. They made
some real improvement, but then China
soon afterward published something kind
of indicating they were, you know, on
par or near par or something to it. And,
you know, I'm worried that the the
Chinese government is saying, well, you
can't publish anything until it's in the
Western press. and then you can, you
know, then it's open and you can talk
about it.
>> That's precisely what I've heard. And
so,
>> yeah. So, so uh, you know, I I'm I'm a
I'm a little bit uh concerned about
that. Now, what we're doing with our our
company is we're doing a new generation
of fabrication of the devices. And I
would cons consider in my my my research
we had the simple fabrication with the
original papers in 85 and then around
2000 we had more sophisticated
fabrication and then for the quantum
supremacy experiment we did something
even more complicated other groups too
but we want to do a similar jump in the
fabrication and what's interesting about
this is we're going to be using applied
materials and the modern fabrication
processes that they have which on 300 mm
tools you know you can't get in China
for example
>> you can get it for camos and then
they're developing we're developing
standard processes but you know new
recipes and new ways to put it together
>> and we think by doing that we can do a
huge leaprog and then get there faster
and get there in a way that you know
will protect our lead. There's other
things we're doing too. Uh and you know
that that's a small part of it, but uh
you know we think there's a way to um
you know really lead the field and uh
and we're happy we have good industrial
partners of uh applied materials
synopsis design tools Hula Packard
Enterprise some startups who do the
theory work. Uh so you know we have a
good consortium and we want to use all
that knowledge and expertise of
engineering to make this happen.
>> Where were you when you got the news
this week that you won the Nobel Prize
and how surprised were you because this
is a 40year-old
research effort. Had anyone giving you a
call rumor gossip mill saying, "Hey,
you're on the list this year potentially
being considered."
>> So let me uh give you a little bit of
the inside story. Um you know if you we
we've known that this was a important
experiment from the beginning. we've
obtained some other prizes that are you
know much less wellknown and really
appreciative of all that and you you
what happens is the Nobel um um system
uh put together Nobel symposiums where
they get together physicists in a
certain field which is quantum
information and this kind of thing and
they they give uh have all the
scientists give talks and and they want
to kind of check on the vi vitality of
the you know of the field, how big is
it? And then you know also maybe some of
the the leaders that maybe think about
it, you know, can they give a good talk?
Would they good be a good
representative?
So um Michelle and John and I have been
to these uh symposiums before and we
kind of knew, you know, what was going
on, you know, that at least we were
considered. And but I I'll just tell you
as a scientist just to be invited to
these and be considered is a is a
fantastic honor, you know, and and
having getting the prize is just so kind
of unbelievable that you shouldn't think
that way. So, you know, I've known about
it for a few years. And in fact, to be
very honest, in the past when the dates
have come around, it's like, oh, is this
going to happen? And then you wake up in
the morning and it's like, "Oh, it
didn't happen." And you're kind of down
for a day. You know, it didn't happen
this year. And that's a very bad
attitude. I I don't like that at all.
And, you know, you you should not covet
some, you know, insanely difficult uh
prize that, you know, only only goes to
a few people. So, what happened this
year is I kind of worked through this
over several years and this year I just
kind of forgot about it. Okay. So, I
went to bed and then uh and then uh we
got the call at 3:00 and my wife
answered the phone and found out what
happened. But um she didn't wake me up
right away because she knew if the day
was going to be hectic and I needed my
sleep to not be grumpy. That
>> was nice of her.
>> Don't want to be grumpy talking it. So,
she woke me up at 5:30 and
>> you know, as I looked at the computer,
oh my god. you know, and then we had
some reporters coming over at 6
>> which, you know, interviewed me, you
know, right when I had found out, half
hour after I'd found out.
>> And it's it's a it's it's great. It's
it's a great honor and uh it's just been
really fun. And then, you know, I've
been getting a lot of emails from people
I've worked with or students I've had in
the past congratulating me and you
exchange little stories and the like.
and it's it's it's kind of a very
special time.
>> That's great. Any um science or
technology fields that you've been
following outside of your core
discipline that you think are really
exciting. I always like to hear what
major kind of thinkers
>> to be honest. I'm just so focused on
doing this and especially when you start
a company, you better be focused, right?
So, I'm doing that. But one of the
fields that I find, this is someone Ben
Mazen at UC Santa Barbara is looking for
exoplanets
and they're using superconducting
detectors that are somewhat similar to
what we're doing. In fact, in the 1990s
or so, I helped, you know, helped
establish that field with other people
and did that for five, six, seven years
uh to do that. but he's doing it in a
different way. And I really like how,
you know, this instrumentation, you
know, that we've been working on is
their quantum devices are are now able
to um uh do these astronomy
uh detectors and and look for look for
these. And of course, there's so much
going on in astronomy these way days
with gravitational detectors and
exoplanet searches and it it it's just
really fascinating to me. And again it's
very much technologyoriented where
people are building good detectors. This
is what I like. Okay. I like building
building instruments. So that that's
particularly interest.
>> Yeah, that's great. I mean very exciting
field and hopefully will develop quantum
computers that will help us build
materials and technology to help us get
there one day.
>> So that's right.
>> Many rungs on the ladder of human
progress. Well, congratulations again on
winning the Nobel Prize in physics this
year. Very welld deserved. It's a
fantastic moment. Enjoy it. Enjoy the
ceremony and we're excited for your
continued work in the field of material
quantum computing. And thank you.
>> Yeah. And thank you. I really enjoyed
the questions and the flow where you
were asking questions to explain it at
the right level for people. And uh I I I
really appreciate that. This is a great
great podcast.
>> Great. Thank you.
[Music]
>> I'm going all in.
