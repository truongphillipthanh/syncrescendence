# OpenAI’s head of platform engineering on the next 12-24 months of AI | Sherwin Wu

**Channel**: Lenny's Podcast
**Published**: 2026-02-12
**Duration**: 1h 19m 40s
**URL**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k

## Description (no transcript available)

Sherwin Wu leads engineering for OpenAI’s API platform, where roughly 95% of engineers use Codex, often working with fleets of 10 to 20 parallel AI agents.

*We discuss:*
1. What OpenAI did to cut code review times from 10-15 minutes to 2-3 minutes
2. How AI is changing the role of managers
3. Why the productivity gap between AI power users and everyone else is widening
4. Why “models will eat your scaffolding for breakfast”
5. Why the next 12 to 24 months are a rare window where engineers can leap ahead before the role fully transforms
