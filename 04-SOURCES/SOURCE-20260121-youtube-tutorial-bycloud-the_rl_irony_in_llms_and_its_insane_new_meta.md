# The RL Irony in LLMs (and its insane new meta)

This video breaks down what's wrong with scaling RL for LLMs, especially in the direction of reaching AGI, but why RL still matters. As RL is noisy and can hurt generalization, yet it enables exploration and self-correction that pretraining can’t, we are stuck between a rock and a hard place with this direction. We’ll also look at why LoRA is becoming the practical way to do RL cheaply, swappable adapters that can match full fine-tuning on reasoning and make personalized agents easier to deploy, which might look like a promising future direction to apply RL on a massive scale.
