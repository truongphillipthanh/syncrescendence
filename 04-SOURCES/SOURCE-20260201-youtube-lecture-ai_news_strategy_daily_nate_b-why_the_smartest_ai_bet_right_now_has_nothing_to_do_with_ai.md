________________________
What's really happening beneath the abundance predictions at Davos? The common story is that AI will create prosperity for all—but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why bottlenecks, not abundance, determine where value actually concentrates:

 • Why $4.5 trillion in AI productivity gains depends entirely on implementation
 • How physical infrastructure constraints are binding hyperscaler expansion
 • What the trust deficit means for coordination in a world of synthetic content
 • Where individual bottlenecks are shifting from skills to taste and judgment

For builders and operators navigating the AI labor market, the strategic question isn't whether abundance is coming—it's identifying which scarce resource you're positioned to solve.
