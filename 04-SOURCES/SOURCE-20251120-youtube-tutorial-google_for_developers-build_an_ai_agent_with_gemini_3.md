## Description (no transcript available)

Gemini 3 is our most intelligent model yet that helps you bring any idea to life. In this video, you’ll learn how to build an AI Agent with Gemini 3 Pro and the Agent Development Kit (ADK). You’ll explore how to build a single agent with access to Google Search as its tool, and interact with it using a web UI. We will also learn how Gemini 3 Pro uses Thought Signatures and we will explore its chain of thought when the agent receives a prompt.
