## Description (no transcript available)

I was honoured to sit down with Demis Hassabis, co-founder and CEO of Google DeepMind, and Prof. Govindan Rangarajan, Director of IISc, to discuss how breakthroughs like AlphaFold could accelerate medicine, healthcare, and scientific progress in India.

We then go deeper into a harder question: scientific taste. What helps great scientists choose the right problems, and why intuition and curiosity are still so difficult for machines to replicate. We also touch on mentorship, experimentation, and why the future belongs to people who can connect ideas across disciplines rather than staying inside silos.

Finally, we zoom out to discuss bigger shifts like AGI, robotics, and AI in the physical world, and what all of this means for engineers, students, and India’s role in global tech.
