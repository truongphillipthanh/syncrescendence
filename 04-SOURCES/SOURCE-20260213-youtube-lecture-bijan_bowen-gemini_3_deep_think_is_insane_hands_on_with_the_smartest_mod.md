In this video, we take a hands-on look at Gemini 3 Deep Think, a reasoning-focused variant designed for deeper planning, stronger tool use, and higher reliability on complex, multi-step tasks.

We start with a first look and then move directly into a series of demanding real-world tests. These include a 3D printer simulation with STL handling, a C++ skateboard game build, RF spectrum 3D visualization, a digital audio app workflow, sketch-to-STL-to-print generation, and a flight combat simulation test.
