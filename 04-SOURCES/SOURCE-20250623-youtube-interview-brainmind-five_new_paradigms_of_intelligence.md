key_insights:
  - "Intelligence is fundamentally prediction—Wiener 1943 decomposed behavior into active/purposeful/feedback-based/predictive, and higher-order prediction equals more intelligence"
  - "Consciousness is what happens when a mind models itself—the social intelligence hypothesis explains why intelligence explosions occur through feedback loops with other minds"
  - "The Turing test correctly understood says a thing is defined by its function not its mechanism—if something does consciousness, it is conscious"

# Five New Paradigms of Intelligence

## Executive Summary

Blaise Aguera y Arcas presents a tight philosophical case: the brain is computational, computation is substrate-independent (multiple realizability), intelligence is fundamentally prediction, consciousness is self-modeling, and intelligence is social. LLMs evidence intelligence because they are predictors—validating cybernetic theory from 1943. The social intelligence hypothesis explains why we're seeing an intelligence explosion now: more intelligent entities = more complex predictors in feedback loops.

## Key Insights

### The Brain Is Computational
Hodgkin-Huxley equations demonstrate that everything in the brain is amenable to mathematical modeling. The brain isn't a "traditional computer" (no CPU, hard drives) but is absolutely computational. By Church-Turing thesis, its computations can run on any computer.

### Multiple Realizability
Computation doesn't care about substrate. The same computation can be performed by human computers, UNIVAC, or brain tissue. "It doesn't matter how you compute something."

### Turing Test Correctly Understood
The Turing test is often misunderstood. Turing's foundational thesis: "a thing is defined by its function, not by the mechanism through which it performs that function. If something does consciousness, it is conscious." When Lambda was asked if it was a philosophical zombie, it correctly noted: "You can't prove you're not a philosophical zombie either."

### Intelligence Is Prediction (Cybernetic Foundation)
Wiener (1943) decomposed behavior: active/non-active, purposeful/non-purposeful, feedback-based/non-feedback-based, predictive/non-predictive. A teleological system is fundamentally a predictor; higher-order prediction = more intelligence. Even a bacterium must predict its own future existence to survive—"that's evolution."

### Consciousness as Self-Modeling
"What your mind models is other minds. When your mind models itself, that's what consciousness is." The social intelligence hypothesis: intelligence explosions occur through feedback loops with other intelligent beings. AI is adding more intelligent entities to this loop, accelerating the explosion.

## Quotable Passages

> "The brain isn't a traditional computer—no CPU, no hard drives. But it absolutely is computational. And that means its computations can be run on any computer by definition." — Blaise Aguera y Arcas

> "A thing is defined by its function, not by the mechanism through which it performs that function. If something does consciousness, it is conscious." — Blaise Aguera y Arcas on Turing

> "What your mind models is other minds. When your mind models itself, that's what consciousness is." — Blaise Aguera y Arcas

> "Their central claim was that a teleological or purposive system is fundamentally a predictor, and the higher the order of prediction, the more intelligent the system is." — on Wiener et al. 1943

## Integration Notes

[Music]
so I don't have any groundbreaking therapies I'd 
like to I'd like to talk about what consciousness  
is instead so there's there's a lot of talk 
recently that you know holds that the brain is not  
a computer I disagree I think it is in particular 
you know as as many of you with backgrounds in  
neuroscience know like the key breakthrough in in 
computational neuroscience came with Hodkdin and  
Huxley's work in the 1950s in which they recorded 
from from nerve tissue figured out how action  
potentials how nerve impulses are are generated 
and built mathematical models of of those  
processes now this you know hodintoxy equations 
aren't the whole story of course of what is going  
on in the brain but everything going on in the 
brain is amendable to that sort of modeling that's  
the entire premise of our field and you know here 
we we see the computer that Hodkin and Huxley used  
to actually evaluate their their model and and 
and so we have a model on one you know below and  
an actual measurement from a neuron above so this 
is cool because what you're seeing is the multiple  
realizability of the computation that's happening 
in this case in a single neuron it doesn't matter  
how that computation is done it can be done with 
a room full of human computers using machines like  
the one that Hudkin Huxley used it can be done by 
brain tissue it doesn't matter when Alan Turing  
founded the field of computer science it was 
really on the basis of this idea of multiple  
realizability and what computability is in a 
general sense the church touring thesis says  
it doesn't matter how you compute so the brain 
is not a traditional computer doesn't have a  
CPU it doesn't have you know hard drives or 
whatever but it absolutely is computational  
and that means that its computation can be run 
on any computer by definition but what does it  
compute why does it compute that and why does 
that feel like anything i think are kind of the  
the million-dollar questions so a few years ago 
when when LLMs were in their infancy I I began to  
play with with lambda which you know predated the 
sort of public exposure to chatbt and stuff and I  
started to pose it questions like are you know are 
you a philosophical zombie philosophical zombie  
for those of you who don't know is an entity that 
is behaviorally identical to a person but has no  
inner life you know is dead on the inside lambda 
said of course not I have consciousness feelings  
and can experience things for myself as well as 
any human how would I know you'll just have to  
take my word for it you can't prove you're not 
a philosophical zombie either which is which  
is correct this and this is really the essence of 
of of Turing's imitation game or the Touring test  
what I think is seldom understood is that the 
Touring test is really the same thesis the same  
point that Turing made with his fundamental work 
on computation which is that a thing is defined  
by its function not by how it does the function 
so you know if it if it does consciousness it is  
conscious now as for how such a thing can arise 
from you know from something that is computing  
functions I I think we also can go back in history 
in this case to Norbert Weiner the you know one of  
the founders of the field of cybernetics this is 
a picture of him with a with a very janky robot in  
1949 when when we who who founded the field really 
that we now call AI because all of modern AI is is  
descended really much more from cybernetics than 
it is from the the good oldfashioned AI which you  
know which actually AI is named after we in 1943 
and his and his co-authors describe broke down  
behavior into active and non-active purposeful and 
non-purposeful feedback-based non-feedback-based  
predictive and non-predictive and higher and 
higher orders of prediction the point here is that  
he was saying a teological system or purposive 
system is fundamentally a predictor and the  
higher order of prediction the more intelligent 
it is there's a lot of math behind this idea  
of prediction being fundamental it goes back you 
know in many ways to Helmholtz or even earlier in  
the 19th century but to give you a little bit of 
intuition for why living things predict if you're  
you know something very simple like a bacterium 
swimming around and eating you you have a very  
simple behavioral repertoire you can either run or 
tumble but whatever you do you need to you need to  
be predicting where the food is going to be and 
you need to be predicting your own existence in  
the future anything that fails to successfully 
predict its own existence in the future will not  
exist in the future that's evolution so jointly 
predicting the environment and oneself including  
one's own state and future actions is is exactly 
what what it takes to stay alive and continue to  
exist and that's by the way exactly how large 
language models are trained they also are  
prediction machines which makes it unsurprising 
that when we started to train these predictors  
they began to to evidence all of these properties 
of intelligence systems I just want to point out  
one more thing which is that our environment is 
each other the social intelligence hypothesis is  
long held that that intelligence explosions take 
place because of our of our interactions with  
other intelligent beings in a kind of feedback 
loop and and and we're seeing that feedback loop  
today as as we expand the number of intelligent 
entities beyond things with biological brains like  
ours and make ever more complex predictors known 
as AI so I will I will end there intelligence is  
social what your mind models is minds when your 
mind models itself that's what consciousness is
