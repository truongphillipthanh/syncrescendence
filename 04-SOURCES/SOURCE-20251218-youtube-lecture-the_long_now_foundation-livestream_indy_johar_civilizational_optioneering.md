## Description (no transcript available)

In this talk, Indy Johar proposes that civilization’s longevity depends less on stability or efficiency, and more on optionality.

Entropy drives systems toward homogenization and exhaustion, but life acts as a counterforce, generating new pathways for becoming. Johar argues that our current economic system collapses value into singular metrics like price, which renders our systems brittle and less capable of adaptation and optionality.

To survive the long now, we must transition to an "optioneering" architecture. Our institutions and economic grammar must be redesigned to increase the surface area of future freedom, not foreclose on it. We do this by shifting away from "closed projects" with finite ends, to "open gardens" where success is measured by the system's ability to evolve and surprise us. By valuing adaptation over control, we can build a civilization capable of coherence in motion.

The Q&A for this talk will be hosted by Denise Hearn, Long Now's Director of Strategic Initiatives.
