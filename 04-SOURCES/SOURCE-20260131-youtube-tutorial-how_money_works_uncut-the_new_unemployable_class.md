TIMESTAMPS:
00:00 Entry Level Jobs Need 3-5 Years Experience
13:17 The Skills Gap Myth
21:49 Have We Forgotten How To Be Professional?
34:52 Most People Are Too Good For Their Jobs
45:28 Why Do Tech Companies Hire And Fire So Much?

You’ve all heard the jokes… a company is looking to fill an entry level role that requires 10 years of experience on a niche program that was only launched 20 months ago. A masters degree isn’t necessary but it is highly preferred, oh and the salary is $15 an hour with the expectation of “reasonable overtime”... 
Now good satire always has an element of truth, and the reality is that these kind of job listings are becoming much more common as people are getting increasingly desperate to find any kind of work. 
The simple business calculation is that there is no real risk or cost to advertising these jobs and huge hidden upsides even if they never end up hiring anybody. 
Now this by itself would be a truly annoying hurdle in the already stressful search for a new job BUT there is another side to all of this as well. 
The narrowing margin between underqualified and overqualified has made huge sections of the workforce almost unemployable and it’s doing it in a way that has been very hard to pick up in the data. 
Now scummy tactics in the job market probably aren’t that shocking to any of you watching the extended cuts channel, but these unique blend of factors and new trends are now all getting thrown into the mix alongside the rush towards AI redundancies, and an already highly uncertain economy…
