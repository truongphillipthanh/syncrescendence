## Description (no transcript available)

Context graphs capture decision traces, exceptions, precedents, and cross-system signals explaining why past choices occurred and making automated decisions auditable. Analysis contrasts traditional systems of record and data warehouses with cross-system agents requiring accessible decision lineage for reliable automation. Implications include context engineering, organizational change management, and design approaches enabling agents to discover organizational schema from real usage rather than predefined schemas.
