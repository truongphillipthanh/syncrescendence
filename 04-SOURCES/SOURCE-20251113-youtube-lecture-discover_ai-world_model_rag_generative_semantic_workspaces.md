## Description (no transcript available)

An ultra-modern RAG system with inherent world model creation and a structured, spaciotemporal memory. 

We've all seen LLMs fail on long-form narratives, their reasoning collapsing under the weight of "context rot" as standard RAG systems feed them a fragmented "bag of chunks." But what if, instead of just retrieving facts, an AI could construct a persistent, episodic memory? 

The Generative Semantic Workspace (GSW) paper proposes a groundbreaking, neuro-inspired framework that does precisely that. It moves beyond fact retrieval to build a dynamic internal world model, using an Operator to witness events and a Reconciler to weave them into a coherent spatiotemporal timeline. 

This architecture allows the model to track evolving actor states and relationships, generating concise narrative summaries from its own structured memory. 

This isn't just a better RAG; it's a blueprint for an AI that truly remembers, and its state-of-the-art performance on episodic benchmarks suggests the future of long-context reasoning is finally here.
