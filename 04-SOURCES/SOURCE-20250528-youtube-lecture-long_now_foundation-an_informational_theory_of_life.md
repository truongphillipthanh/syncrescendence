# Sara Imari Walker: An Informational Theory of Life

## MACROSCOPIC NARRATIVE LENS ALIGNMENT

### Primary Lenses Illuminated

| Lens | How Source Advances Understanding |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| **Civilizational Phase Transition** | Life itself is phase transition—"the universe exploring possibility space." Technology extends this into new phase. |
| **The Technocene** | Direct theoretical foundation: technology IS life. Technosphere is living system at planetary scale. |
| **Planetary Phase Shift** | "It takes a planet to make life." Life operates at multiple scales simultaneously, from molecular to planetary. |
| **The Great Filter Window** | Assembly theory provides framework: will our complexity survive? Selection continues at civilizational scale. |
| **Adaptive Cycle** | Selection as fundamental process operating at all scales—chemical, biological, technological, civilizational. |
| **The Reflexive Epoch** | Matter remembering its own history. Objects as embodied information about their construction. |

### Cross-Lens Synthesis

Walker's framework provides theoretical unification across multiple macroscopic narratives:

1. **Technocene + Planetary Phase Shift**: Technology isn't separate from nature—it's the same evolutionary process operating on new substrates
2. **Adaptive Cycle + Great Filter**: Selection operates at civilizational scale; we are undergoing selection now
3. **Information Age + Reflexive Epoch**: Information IS material. Matter carries history. The distinction dissolves.

---

## KEY FRAMEWORKS EXTRACTED

### 1. Assembly Theory Core

> "Life is the process by which the universe explores the space of possible complex objects through historical processes of selection and construction."

Objects defined not just by physical properties but by minimum steps to construct them (assembly index). Threshold of 15: above this, repeated production requires life.

**Implications for Syncrescendence**:
- CANON documents as high-assembly objects requiring selection
- Processing pipeline as exploration of conceptual possibility space
- Integration as construction pathway through assembly space

### 2. Objects as Embodied History

> "Every object tells a story about how it came to exist. A molecule with a high assembly index tells you there was a process that repeatedly constructed this particular configuration."

The information is not separate from the physical structure—it IS the physical structure. This dissolves form/matter, information/substrate distinctions.

**Integration target**: CANON-00015 (specifically Information & Epistemic phases)

### 3. Technology is Life

> "Technology is life—literally, not metaphorically. Technologies are high-assembly objects that exist because of historical processes of selection and construction."

The technosphere—totality of human technology as global evolving system—is life. "We're not separate from the technosphere, observing it from outside. We're embedded in it."

**Implications for CANON-30xxx (Intelligence chain)**:
- AI systems as extension of life's exploration of assembly space
- Agentic architecture as life creating new construction pathways
- IIC as living system participating in planetary computation

### 4. Lineage as Fundamental Unit

> "The fundamental unit of life is not the cell. It's the lineage."

What's fundamental is not the individual organism at any moment but the entire lineage—the chain of causation through time. Individual instances come and go; the lineage persists, accumulating complexity.

**Implications for CANON structure**:
- CANON lineages (chains) as fundamental units
- Version history as accumulated complexity
- Cross-references as construction pathways

### 5. Selection Before Biology

> "Selection—evolutionary selection—doesn't begin with biology. It begins much earlier, at the level of chemistry."

Selection is a general process predating life. Molecules that can catalyze their own formation, stabilize themselves, participate in autocatalytic networks become more abundant. History constrains future possibilities.

**Integration target**: CANON-00004 (Evolution)

### 6. Planetary Scale of Life

> "Life might not be localizable to individual organisms at all. What's fundamental is the process of exploring assembly space and creating complexity. That process operates at multiple scales simultaneously."

From molecular to cellular to ecosystem to biosphere—each scale coupled to others. "The entire planet is the unit of life. It takes a planet to make life as we know it."

**Integration target**: CANON-35200 (Gaian Node)

### 7. Universe as Self-Constructor

> "Maybe the laws themselves are constructed through the process of the universe exploring possibility space."

Speculative but profound: physical laws might be regularities emerging from history of selection, not timeless truths. The universe is fine-tuned for life because the universe IS life.

## CANON INTEGRATION SPECIFICATIONS

### CANON-00015-MACROSCOPIC_NARRATIVES-cosmos.md

**Section**: IX. Evolutionary & Consciousness Phases
**Addition**: Assembly Theory as theoretical foundation

> SOURCE-20250528-043: Walker's Assembly Theory provides rigorous physical foundation for understanding civilizational phase transition. Life is "the universe exploring possibility space through selection." Technology extends this process—the technosphere is literally alive. This reframes all other narrative lenses as aspects of a single evolutionary phenomenon operating at multiple scales.

### CANON-00004-EVOLUTION-cosmos.md

**Section**: Theoretical Foundations
**Addition**: Selection as pre-biological universal process

> SOURCE-20250528-043: Walker demonstrates that selection "doesn't begin with biology—it begins at the level of chemistry." The assembly index provides quantitative measure: objects above index 15 cannot exist without selection. This extends evolutionary framework to encompass all high-complexity objects including technology and ideas.

### CANON-35200-GAIAN_NODE-lunar

**Section**: Theoretical Framework
**Addition**: Planetary scale as fundamental unit

> SOURCE-20250528-043: "It takes a planet to make life as we know it." Assembly theory demonstrates life operates at multiple coupled scales—molecular, cellular, ecosystem, planetary. The biosphere isn't just a collection of organisms but a planetary-scale process exploring assembly space. This validates Gaian perspective with rigorous physical theory.

### CANON-30400-AGENTIC_ARCHITECTURE

**Section**: Ontological Status
**Addition**: AI as life extension

> SOURCE-20250528-043: "When you ask 'Who's really doing the making?'—is it us, or is it the broader process of life exploring possibility space?—the distinction dissolves." AI systems are life extending into new assembly space. Agents are construction pathways. This reframes AI development as participation in planetary-scale evolutionary process.

---

## QUOTABLE INSIGHTS FOR INTEGRATION

### On What Life Is
> "Life is the process by which the universe explores the space of possible complex objects through historical processes of selection and construction. Life is what happens when matter starts remembering its own history."

### On Technology as Life
> "A smartphone has an incredibly high assembly index. It requires an enormous number of steps to construct, each one building on previous innovations. You need metallurgy, semiconductors, software, global supply chains. None of this could exist without billions of years of prior evolution—both biological and technological."

### On the Newest as Oldest
> "The newest things are actually the oldest things, in terms of evolutionary time. A modern smartphone contains more evolutionary history than a simple molecule, because it required all of that history to come into existence."

### On Lineage
> "You are, in a very real sense, the universe remembering itself. Your DNA encodes the history of all your ancestors, going back billions of years. The proteins in your cells reflect the history of chemical evolution. The atoms in your body were forged in stars that died billions of years ago."

### On Information and Matter
> "Matter itself carries information. The information is not separate from the physical object—it IS the physical object. Every object tells a story about how it came to exist."

### On Planetary Scale
> "At the largest scale, you have the entire biosphere of a planet, transforming the atmosphere, the oceans, the geology. Each of these scales is coupled to the others. In a sense, the entire planet is the unit of life."

## SYNTHESIS WITH BRATTON (DIALOGUE SECTION)

The Walker-Bratton dialogue synthesizes:

1. **Assembly Theory + The Stack**: Both describe layered systems where complexity accumulates through historical construction
2. **Combinatorial Explosion + Pre-Paradigmatic Moment**: The space of possibility exceeds exploration capacity; selection is how reality navigates this
3. **Technosphere as Life + Planetary Computation**: Technology is how planetary-scale life extends into new assembly space

> BRATTON: "How does assembly theory relate to things like autocatalytic sets, or the RNA world hypothesis?"
> WALKER: "Assembly theory is more abstract. It's trying to understand what all possible origins of life have in common, regardless of the specific mechanism."

This positions assembly theory as meta-framework encompassing other origin-of-life theories—applicable to any substrate, any chemistry, any form of life including AI.

## Transcript

[Music]
Good evening. Welcome to our Long Now
Talk with Sarah Omari
[Applause]
Walker. I'm Rebecca Lendel, executive
director here at the Long Now
Foundation.
I'm excited to now introduce to you our
guest host for the evening, Benjamin
Bratton, director of the Antictherra
program at the Burguan Institute.
Benjamin and Sarah are longtime
collaborators and they're working at the
very edges of their respective
disciplines and they're we're fortunate
to have them here with us tonight as um
kind of voyagers at these new frontiers
of thought. Thank you for being with us
and enjoy and over to you Benjamin
Bratton.
[Applause]
Uh thanks Rebecca. As you'll see Sarah's
talk is going to be quite a wild ride.
Um so what I sort of come up with is
sort of like say some key concepts of
walkerism that if you can kind of hold
on to this may help uh give you a little
bit of a of a of a menu of what you're
in in store for. First um astrobiology.
We generally think of astrobiology as
like the Martians have stuff from outer
space. No, it's also a way in which we
think about us right here. We are the
astrobiology life in relationship to
this second selection. What we think of
as natural selection uh begins before
biology. It's actually much deeper uh in
in time uh and deeper in in process
which if you uh think about it actually
sort of changes everything. Life which
is the main sort of the topic of Sarah's
work is something that is different from
being alive. Alive and life are actually
different things which she will um
explain in some detail that life as life
evolves and acrus it builds upon itself.
Um it's all about scaffolds and
scaffolds building on scaffolds and
scaffolds building on scaffolds that
becomes increasingly complex. The newest
thing is actually the oldest thing as
Sarah will explain. So the the amount of
complexity in something also speaks to
the amount of time it took for this to
evolve. The amount of time in something
is the amount of complexity in it. And
so the most complex things in our
universe like our technosphere are
actually the oldest
things. Technologies, the things that we
call technologies um are themselves a
form of life. They're not separate from
life. They are a kind of life and they
are also a kind of life with which we
think. We think through the technologies
which allow us to see the world in a
different way which then allows us to
remake the world in a different way. So
once again, it's life making life um all
the way on
down. What is the basic unit of life?
Well, for for some it was the cell. For
Sarah, it's the whole planet. It takes a
planet to make what we recognize as
life. All of the processes working
together to come to constitute what we
recognize in this form. And then lastly,
to discover life is is going to prove
something that ultimately I think in
walkerism hasn't actually happened yet
will be more like discovering gravity uh
than anything else. So those are sort of
eight key ideas. If you can manage to
hold all of these in your head at once,
this will give you a little bit of a a
starting point to uh what you're about
to experience. With that, I'm very happy
to introduce Sarah Amari Walker. Thank
you.
I'm so happy to see everyone here
tonight. Thanks so much for coming out.
I think we're going to have a very fun
evening. I'm really excited to share
some ideas with you. Uh this is all a
work in progress and I want you to feel
like you're on a part of the journey
because really the research program is
is fundamentally about what we are as
living things. And what I hope that we
can do with the kind of work that we're
doing is actually develop new languages
to understand ourselves. And so when I'm
thinking fundamentally about the nature
of life, I think we don't understand it
yet. It's a little bit like what Ben was
saying in the introduction. We It's like
think about how humans talked about
gravity before we had an understanding
of the theory of gravity, right? We
couldn't understand planetary motion in
the night sky as being the same as
what's holding us here on Earth. And so
I think we don't have the language to
understand what life is. We don't
understand ourselves. And so that's
actually what we're trying to do. So the
title of the talk is an
informationational theory for life. And
I started very early in my career
thinking about information, but it's
transformed quite a bit. So I'm going to
kind of show you this the current state
of it. It starts with this question. Are
we alone? I think probably most of us in
this room hopefully have thought about
this at least once. Not are we alone
like as a person, but are we alone in
the universe? And usually when we think
about this question, we think about the
immensity of space, all of the stars and
galaxies out there. So the image in the
background here is the Hubble Deep
Field. And the Hubble Deep Field is a
tiny image on the night sky as far as
spatial volume, but it contains millions
of galaxies. And each galaxy has
billions of stars. And I've been told
most of my career that surely life must
be common in the universe because
there's lots of territory for it to
emerge. But the facts of the matter are
that we only know this planet is
inhabited and we don't know if there's
any life in any of those billions of
galaxies out
there. And I would like to know I don't
know about you guys. Would would you
guys like to know? Yes, we want to know.
Okay, good. All right, I'm in the right
crowd. All right, good. The curious lot
is here. All right, fantastic. So, how
do we come to understand whether any of
these stars, any of the planets that we
found around stars in our own galaxy
actually is inhabited? I think this is a
good question for the long now because I
don't think it's a year-long problem for
us. I don't think it's a decade long
problem. This is at least a century or
you know millennial long problem. We've
been asking this question for a long
time and I'm hoping that our generation
can get us closer. But currently the way
we understand the world is by actually
collecting data from our telescopes and
building simulations of that
data. Right? So this is just a spatial
map of the galaxies that I had in that
picture. And in fact, when we start to
model the universe and we try to
understand it, we have kind of ways that
we think about modeling and paradigms
that we use that are centuries old in
the way that we think about how the
universe works. So this picture of the
spatial map of the galaxy actually looks
a little bit like this picture. This
picture is a cellular automa. And so for
those that might not know what a
cellular automa is, it's a very simple
computational model. And people in my
field of complex systems or one of the
many fields I I have worked in that
study emergent complexity like to use
these simple toy models because they
display very complex dynamical
patterns. So if I took this model and I
actually ran it, this one particular one
I'm showing is called the game of life.
You might see a richness of the kind of
patterns that are displayed. And this is
just a very short clip, but you could go
online after the talk if you're super
curious and play with the game of life
for hours. People have been discovering
patterns in it for decades. It's
actually really kind of an interesting
niche culture. But what happens in this
model is it's actually assuming a kind
of dynamical system that Newton came up
with originally when he was thinking
about trying to understand motion in the
physical world and mechanical laws of
motion. And so what we do when we try to
study the universe is we simulate it
with our models. And the kinds of
simulations we have currently assume
some kind of initial condition and some
fixed rule that governs the universe for
all
time. And so when we study emerging
complexity in the game of life, we're
assuming the rules never change. We're
assuming nothing about the universe
fundamentally changes because of the
patterns in it. And this is not what we
experience as living things. We've lived
enough history as humans to know that
our ideas, our culture, the things we do
actually change the structure of the
reality around us. And so this paradigm
doesn't fit us anymore. We don't have
the right paradigm for understanding the
reality we actually live in. It's not
the paradigm written 300 years ago in
theoretical physics. And so the question
that I'm interested in tonight, but just
more fundamentally since I've been
working on the origin of life my entire
career is how does the knowledge of this
particular problem transform this kind
of fundamental level of understanding
that we have about
reality. And so we can think about the
sort of models of the universe we've
built over the centuries. So this one is
a model of the solar system and this was
derived over many centuries. It started,
you know, very early with epicycles and
this idea of, you know, trying to build
predictive models of planetary motion,
which were circles inside of circles.
And you'll notice that my image here is
not even accurate because they're not
ellipses. But you imagine some kind of
mechanism for the universe. And the
reason we came up with this mechanistic
model was because we invented clocks
that could accurately keep track of time
in seconds. And we used that technology
to actually accurately map planetary
motion. And then with that accurate map,
we were able to realize that they were
ellipses. Galileo actually figured out
about inertia and Newton came up with
laws of gravitation. And so we had this
model of the universe that came actually
inspired by the idea of mechanical
clocks in some sense of the universe as
a mechanism, a clockwork mechanism with
the laws of planetary motion. And
interestingly, sort of a theme that
you're going to see throughout the talk
is that each new theory of physics we
develop comes with its own concept of
time. And the time we inherited from
Newton's generation is that time is
linear. It's a substance the universe
moves through. If you notice planetary
motion, we have laws. The laws remain
fixed and time is is something that this
system actually passes through. It's not
an active property of the system.
Later we came up with the laws of
thermodynamics. Again trying to look at
the real world and understand it. We
invented steam engines. We needed
theories that actually helped us
understand how they worked. This became
thermodynamics. And we started to think
about the universe as a giant engine.
The second law of thermodynamics rules
all and time has a direction. The time
is a direction is a little bit
antithetical to the time as linear and
there are still discussions ongoing
about that. But fundamentally what
thermodynamics is telling us is that
time is directional.
And in the last century we had sort of a
new paradigm emerge that the universe is
a simulation. So this is sort of the
popular zeitgeist that we're living in a
computer simulation. And interestingly
enough there were actually two theories
of relativity that emerged in the last
century. The one that's familiar to most
of us is the special theory of
relativity and general relativity which
gave us the concept of relative time in
physics. But there's a relative time in
computation as well, which is the fact
that the same program can run at
different times on different computers.
And so I think this idea of time is
relative was just kind of an emergent
cultural thing in many of our theories
that emerged in the last century. Now,
each of the models of the universe that
emerged with the technologies of the
time that I just showed you, I think
still is in the same paradigm that the
universe doesn't fundamentally change
over time and the rules are fixed.
Interestingly enough, we have a theory
that emerged in the 1800s as an
explanation for biological forms, the
theory of evolution, which Darwin is
most famous for. And he actually, you
know, was really frustrated um by the
fact that we didn't have laws as simple
as Newton's laws to describe life. But
he still came up with very elegant
theories and ideas about how to explain
it. And the juxaposition I want you to
hold in your mind is this idea of fixed
laws, fixed rules that govern our
universe. The universe is predictable,
deterministic with this idea of endless
forms. What does it really mean to have
endless forms? Is that really possible
in the universe as we understand it now?
Is that really possible in the actual
physical universe? And if the real
universe can do endless forms, what
would that kind of physics look like?
Our planet seems to have that. So, we're
going to talk about the question, are we
alone? But we're going to talk about it
as a lens of what are we? Because I
think if we don't fundamentally
understand ourselves and we don't
understand how we're architecting our
reality, we don't understand what we
would look like from the outside, we're
not going to be able to recognize things
like us in the universe. We're not going
to know what we're talking about because
we don't have the languages to talk to
each other about the phenomena of life.
In fact, in my field, this is really
funny. Um so sorry I'm laughing already
because I I just remember being a
posttock and going to a conference at a
chemistry uh meeting and one of my
colleagues stood up and said life does
not exist and this was sort of the
opening of their talk and this is the
culture of chemists working on the
origin of life is it's much easier to
assume the phenomena of life doesn't
exist then to tackle it head-on and in
fact there's similar things that you
know once you look at molecules it's
very clear life is not there and you can
just reduce everything to the parts of
living things but of Of course, there's
also the paradox that no atom in your
body is alive, yet you are alive as a
living entity. And I certainly I don't
know how many people in here think
they're
alive. Okay, cool. All right, good. I
didn't see any chairs raise their hands,
but I saw most of the people. Okay, I
think we're we're getting the categories
moderately right. I personally felt uh
like deeply existentially perplexed. I
would go to these meetings on origins of
life and almost no one was talking about
the origin of life. They were talking
about other problems. How do you make a
protein or an amino acid which is a
component of a protein? Like how do you
make the parts of living things
prebiotically? If we take everything
apart about what we are and we try to
engineer it in an experiment. To me, as
I think about it now, it's not how I
understood it then. Basically, they're
deconstructing four billion years of
evolution and they're using intelligent
design to replace it. And this is not
the question we need to ask. The
question we need to ask is how does the
universe generate information and
complexity when it has none. That is the
origin of life. And I think that
question has some really interesting
consequences which we're going to
explore tonight. And one thing I want
you to think about when I'm talking
about the concepts is the idea that
theories themselves are technologies. So
one of the reasons I walk through these
models of the universe is that each one
has framed fundamentally how we think
about ourselves and our place in the
universe. So imagine using fundamental
physics to inform your daily life
philosophy. Now it's not something
everyone does, but some people do. And
the reason I I I like picking on this
example is even if theoretical physics
and the ideas that uh come out of that
exercise seem very esoteric to you and
part of a small part of a community that
has little to do with the daily workings
of everyone else on the planet. These
ideas percolate and they are part of the
sort of base layer of understanding of
our reality and they become part of
human culture over time. And so I think
we have a deep responsibility to
actually cultivate theories as
technologies that are actually enabling
for the future and that our theories
themselves need to paint optimistic
views about what we are and our place in
the universe. They also need to actually
correspond to reality which is the hard
part um of being a physicist. For me
science fundamentally when you really
think about science as a human endeavor
it's not about the experiment and the
hypothesis testing. It's about building
explanations for how the world works
that last centuries. That's what we try
to do as scientists at the base level of
what we do. And all of the things that
individual scientists do, we're trying
to fill in that narrative. It's the the
narrative of reality that we want to
tell
ourselves. So, I'm going to start
talking now about life and the work that
I'm doing uh with my collaborators.
Metrology is a word that I've only run
into recently. Um, I like challenging
myself by suddenly immersing myself in
different fields. And metrology is the
science of measurement. And you would
think as a physicist I would have
understood what a measurement was in my
undergrad education. I can tell you I
did not ever get a course in what a
measurement is. And if you get into the
science of measurement, it's incredibly
complex. And so one of the ways I think
about measurement right now is that
measurement is the way that we take our
abstract ideas and we try to map them
actually to the physical world through
devices that allow us to probe the world
outside of our own mind and look for
structural regularities. So measurement
is actually incredibly important because
it's how we map our abstraction to
physical reality. And if your theory
doesn't correspond to measurement or you
can't embed your abstraction in a
measurement, you have no way of testing
it.
And when I started working on the origin
of life when I was a PhD student very
reluctantly at first actually I'll have
you know I wanted to be a cosmologist I
thought that was very romantic. Um and
then I realized you know like origins of
life was something that no one had an
idea about like no one had any
conceptual framing for this problem and
that actually uh became the love of my
life uh conceptually and intellectually
is is this problem. Okay. So when I was
working on it at that early stage, I
thought we might be able to come up with
theories, but we would never be able to
test them. It turns out um there was
someone else on the planet, uh Lee
Cronin, who's a chemist, who was
thinking about the same problem in a
very different way than I was. And Lee's
problem was that he didn't like the way
that anyone was doing origin of life
chemistry because of this issue of the
amount of design we were putting into
the experiments. We were looking for
things that are on our planet now,
molecular structures, and assuming that
they were relevant to the origin of life
as a general process in the universe,
rather than looking for how
unconstrained chemical systems generate
complexity without any design put in by
us or anything else. And so Lee is
trying to build robots in his lab that
can explore chemistry as messy as
possible. The messier the better because
he wants to see life emerge in his lab.
And he says,"Well, if life's going to
emerge in my lab, how will I measure
it?" And so, this is actually the
foundations of the theory that I'm going
to introduce to you. It's called
assembly theory. And the conjecture of
the theory is that life is the only
mechanism the universe has for
generating complexity. There are no
Boltzman brains. If you know that
concept, we don't get fluctuating
existence of objects like in this room.
You will exist nowhere else in the
universe. There's not a multiverse of
possibilities. You only exist here and
you exist here because four billion
years was necessary to construct you on
this planet. That's the framing that we
have. So it's very contrary to current
physics which has this idea that
everything can exist everywhere and
there might be another you out there but
it's just a very low probability or you
might just be a brain that fluctuated
into existence and your experience right
now is not real. All of those things are
not consistent with the paradigm that
we're building.
What we think is that complexity happens
because of evolution and selection and
the space is so huge and the universe is
small by comparison to all the things
that could create that existence is
really special. If you get to exist, you
are like that's amazing. Okay, so yes,
what up for existence? All right, cool.
I like this enthusiasm. I also like
existing. It's great. It's better than
the alternative. All right. So, life is
the only way to generate complex
objects. And so, how did how did this
happen? Um, okay. So, I I just want to
go through this argument. I just told
you that you probably don't exist
anywhere else. Great. I'm glad we're
here. Um, but how like what are we
actually talking about? So, I think when
I show you the Hubble deep field, I
think most of us have a sense that the
universe is big, right? Because we're
told it's huge. It's 13.7 billion
lightyears across and there's billions
of galaxies out there. We don't actually
think about how big the space of
possibilities a single planet can
generate. Cominatorial space I'm going
to talk about a lot. You can think about
it as the space of all configurations of
something. So I had to learn chemistry
this way. Um but you can also think of
Lego or you can think of language. Think
of all possible ideas you could build
with human language or you can think
about all possible technologies. You can
think about all possible
molecules. Cominatorial space is really
big. It's actually uncountably big. I'm
going to give you an example of one
molecule and I borrowed this example
from Lee uh which is taxol. So taxol is
a molecule that's been discovered on
Earth. It's not a particularly special
molecule. It's used as an anti-cancer
drug. But if you wanted to make
every version of a molecule, a
threedimensional structure that
corresponds to the same molecular
formula and you had just one copy of
each molecule, that one molecular
formula would fill 1.5 universes of
volume. One
molecule. So actually when
chemiraticians try to compute this
number of possible molecules, they
can't. We don't know how big chemical
space is because we don't know how many
possible molecules there are. And so
this gets into an interesting
uh question because it's like why does
taxol exist on this planet and not the
other possibilities? Clearly our
universe doesn't have enough time and
resources to make every single molecule
with tax's molecular formula. It doesn't
have enough resources to make every
molecule with the same molecular formula
as DNA. It doesn't have all the
resources to make all the configurations
of what could be the chairs in this
room. It can't exhaust all
possibilities. So this raises a
fundamental question about what is the
mechanism of what gets to exist? Why are
these structures the ones that actually
we observe as physical objects and these
other ones we might imagine? We might be
able to say something about chemical
space because we observe a molecule. So
we have this idea of this counterfactual
space that could exist but we actually
don't observe it to exist.
the things we do exist. What our
conjecture is is is they exist because
evolution and selection have constrained
that possibility space. There's
information in the history that makes
this object and not this object. And
this is where we start to get into an
actual way of building anformational
theory of
life. So to explain the
idea, I'm going to start with Lego
because Lego is much easier for most of
us than chemistry. Probably most of us
maybe have had a pile in our home that
looks like this if you have children or
if you just like having fun. If I was
going to shake the Lego set
indefinitely, what kind of structures do
we expect to arise out of this? Can all
of you hold an image in your mind of
something you might build out of these
Lego? Great. All right, I'm going to
also make something out of these
Lego. How many of you made this? Just
curious. I've never done this before.
Did anyone make this object?
No. Okay. Oh, we got one. Oh, excellent.
Okay, cool. Probably we already made
this object because it's been imprinted
on most of our minds. We kind of most of
you probably recognize it. It's a castle
at least. I hope most people know this
is a castle. Okay, good. Uh, we do live
in the same selected history. Did most
of you make objects that were much
simpler than this? How many people made
something very simple? Okay, so even
trying to make something like mentally
as an exercise that's very complex is
actually quite hard because it requires
a lot of steps. Um, and this is actually
the way that we think about formalizing
the complexity of an object. So, I'm
going to introduce assembly theory now.
And I want you to think about the Lego
analogy. But the idea is if you take
something down to its parts, and you
take the parts and you put them
together, and then you keep doing that
by putting parts together that you've
built already, you will have a a
sequence of steps that's the shortest
causal history for making that object.
And we call that the assembly index. And
this becomes how hard it is for the
universe to produce that object. That's
all you need to know about it. Castles
are hard. They don't happen
spontaneously. They require a lot of
evolution. And in this case, it requires
a lot of human evolution because we had
to have cultural evolution. We had to
build castles. We had to have somebody
write a book about a little boy and
magic that became wildly popular. And we
also had to have Lego and billions of
them on the planet. And then we get
that. Okay. So, that's not an easy
object for the universe to construct. It
requires a lot of history. Now, we want
to formalize that idea. How do you
formalize this in an objective way? a
way that you can actually do physics
with. So this is where we get into the
idea that there's a property this
minimal number of steps to produce an
object. I'm showing it here now for ATP
which is a critical molecule in biology.
For ATP the minimum number of steps
where you take bonds as fundamental
units instead of Lego blocks and you put
the bonds together and then you put the
things you've made already to get ATP is
21 steps.
Now I can compute that for a graph of
the molecule once I understand the
physics. But here's where what Lee did
was really clever. He was in the lab. He
was trying to build robots to explore
for origins of life. And he said, "I
have a mass spec mass spectrometer. I
can do measurements on molecules by
breaking them apart and looking at the
mass to charge ratio of the molecules
and the
fragments. If I can use this to probe
how complex these structures are in a
way that I can measure, then I can do
something interesting. And so this is
actually the genesis of assembly theory
was thought experiments on mass spec and
the fragmentation that mass spec do to
resolve the causal structure of
molecules. And the exercise is that this
process of breaking a molecule apart and
trying to resolve the minimal steps to
rebuild it from those elementary parts
actually can be mapped to measurements
in the lab. And actually Lee's lab has
done it now with NMR and infrared and
mass spec. So there's three different
ways that you can measure the same
property of molecules. And it allows you
to say the minimal amount of causation,
evolution, selection, information,
whatever you want to call it for this
molecule. Why is this important? Why is
it important that we can measure this
kind of constructed complexity or this
causation? It's important because of
this conjecture we had that life is the
only thing in the universe that can
build complex objects. So remember how
big the space of taxol is. Now if you're
in chemical space and you add a single
bond, there's many ways you can do it.
And so every time you add a single bond
in those assembly steps, you're actually
increasing the complexity in a space
that's exponentially growing. So the
space gets larger at every step that you
take. So if you do an assembly index
increase of one, you've moved into an
exponentially larger space every single
step.
So what we're measuring with this causal
measure is is actually this compression
of selection into these objects that get
to exist against this exponentially
growing background. And our conjecture
is because of the structure of that
space, there should be a threshold that
we should never expect to observe an
object unless it's the product of life.
That there was actually a selective
mechanism, an information processing
system. That was where we went into it.
And so Lee's lab is very clever. So this
is sort just sort of a depiction that
you can take a certain number of steps
and then suddenly you might have
something that's alive done for origami.
The principles of assembly theory are
quite
general. They actually went and tested
it in the lab. So this is a paper that
was published in 2021
uh building a life meter with this idea
of molecular assembly. And so they went
and they took a whole bunch of samples
abiotic biological dead. The conjecture
uh actually held up to the experimental
test. So what was done here is the
molecular assembly that I just told you
the minimum number of steps is shown on
the x-axis on this plot that says life.
The only molecules that we found above
assembly index 15 were products of life.
So if you take abiotic samples and
actually NASA was really interested in
this. So they sent samples to Lee's lab
that they had blinded and they really
tried to trick him. And they sent him uh
samples of merchesin which is like one
of the messiest chemistries that's
abiotic. It's a meteorite very messy.
And what they were able to do is using
this approach with the measurement
techniques that they developed to be
able to distinguish the biological from
non-biological samples. And it conformed
to the theory's conjecture that there
should be a very abrupt complexity
threshold and that living things were
the only things that could produce
things above this background because the
space is getting so exponentially large.
We should never observe those objects in
high abundance enough to detect them.
And if you go into pure abotic samples
like meteorites, what they are is what
we call tar. They're just a total rand
random mess of molecules. You can't
actually even differentiate some of the
molecules because there's just so much
combinatorial complexity. And what life
does has selected out specific
structures in high abundance that are
very complex. So we can measure that.
That's pretty cool. It's very cool for
me um because as a theoretical
physicist, I live in abstract land most
of the time. What we're trying to do is
actually look at this and use it now to
build a theory. And one of the things
that we're excited about is this idea of
recognizing alien life as constructed
complexity. So there's clear
applications to looking for life on
other worlds. If we don't know the
molecules, we can actually go in and we
can discover life as we don't know it.
Even life as no one knows it. And that's
exciting. But what I'm really after is
that explanation for what we are, the
fundamental physics of life. And I'm
very excited about where assembly theory
can take us with that. So what I want to
get to now is using this fundamental
idea of the kind of complexity assembly
captures. This idea that there's a
minimum number of causal steps to
produce an object. And this somehow
tells us about how hard it is for the
universe to generate that structure. We
can use it actually to formalize some
really interesting theories and
philosophies about the nature of life.
And it's going to be a little bit
counterintuitive. Most of the history of
physics is. And so a lot of the ideas
I'm going to talk about seem to be
merging computation and material
languages in a really weird way. Um, and
that's kind of on purpose because I
think what we're doing by taking these
measurements that are of this causal
structure, this kind of some people
might call it a computational structure
of an object. I don't like to think
about it that way, but you might. What
we're really doing is doing a
unification of the ideas of information
as an abstract property and thinking
about it now as a physical property. And
if you look at the history of physics,
every time we do one of these kind of
unifications, it really changes our
thinking. And so that's what I'm hoping
is on the frontier
here. So I'm going to talk about
assembly space as if it's a physical
space because that's the way that I
think about it. So we have invented many
kinds of physical spaces in our history.
One of them is coordinate space and we
invented that by inventing rulers and
actually measuring the physical geometry
of our environment. Assembly space. You
can think of this idea of the assembly
index actually measures things in this
what seems to us to be an abstract space
but actually has become measurable
through the advent of assembly theory of
how causally deep objects
are. And if we can measure that then we
can start to orient all of these complex
objects in our world and root them in a
physical space. And that's actually what
we're trying to do. I'm showing here an
assembly space for adenosine. It's a
molecule that's very important in
genetic systems. And what I want to you
to take from this is that this idea of
the assembly space is actually a
material property. It's one we can
measure. And we can also think of it as
anformational
property. Because what it's talking
about, what it's capturing is how much
information and selection are in the
history of that object in order for it
to exist. So it's a physical space. You
can measure it. It's predictive. What
does it tell us about evolution and
selection as fundamental mechanisms in
our universe? So in the introduction,
Ben also mentioned this idea of
selection before biology. And so we're
really after this idea that all the
structures that the universe creates are
selected to exist and they might exist
in a larger space. And so we have some
objects we can observe. They might be
molecules. They might be a Lego castle.
And we can construct a space of this
minimal causal history, the assembly
space, what we call assembly observed.
This space tells us a lot about the
structure of what doesn't exist which is
super interesting and this is where it
gets into a really intriguing philosophy
and theory of
information. So I'll walk you through it
very briefly and kind of
quickly. We're in like the deep weeds of
theoretical physics now. first layer
that you can build out of that space is
imagine I take all of the Lego blocks
and I and I build every single possible
structure, but I don't obey the rules of
the Lego universe. I just I can glue
them together. I don't have to use those
little nubs or like whatever they are.
So I can build the space of all
imaginable structures. Some of them are
non-physical by the laws of the Lego
universe. That's what we call assembly
universe. It's an imagined space. So
somehow encoded in these objects is
actually our ability to as intelligent
agents to extract this kind of space
that it could exist but it doesn't. The
second layer is assembly possible which
includes all the structures that are
actually possible to construct with the
rules of that universe. And so for Lego
it would be actually using the the
building block brick rules to construct
objects not just assuming that they
could stick together in arbitrary ways.
In chemistry it's using real chemical
bonds and looking at thermodynamic
stability. So there's a set of possible
structures that are consistent with our
laws of
physics. Those would be consistent with
standard physics also. But what assembly
theory offers is a second layer inside
of that. So this is kind of the third
layer in the nested assembly universe
which we call assembly contingent which
is the observable structures that the
universe actually can build because
they're built along historically
contingent trajectories. So this idea of
the assembly space and looking at the
structure as actually being a physical
feature means when you're actually
building an evolutionary system, it has
to scaffold on the layers that came
before. And because that space is so
exponentially large, it can't exhaust
every layer. So by the time you get to
things like us, we are so historically
contingent. If you rewound history a
hundred years, we would be radically
different right now because the space is
so exponentially large, it becomes
unpredictable.
So the real history we observe is just
one such history within the structure
and our ability to access some of the
other histories by looking at our own
causal structure is actually one of the
mechanisms I think that we use to create
novelty in the future. We can learn the
rules of our own history and we can use
them to actually build into the
future. So we have a way of measuring
how deep you are in this assembly space.
We do it with this equation we call the
assembly equation. It really only has
two properties you need to worry about.
It's exponential in the number of steps
because that space is exponentially
expanding and it cares about how many
copies you see of an object. The reason
being a one-off fluctuation doesn't
imply a long lineage of things that
actually could rebuild that object. So
what we're interested in is the
causation on a planet like us that can
make many things that are similar in
structure. So human beings are selected
structures that exist on this planet.
They're not exact copies, but there's
many of us because evolution actually
has a reliable mechanism for generating
humanlike structures. And so this this
equation is actually capturing that
feature in this very abstract space and
allowing us to figure out ways to
measure this as a generic property of
physical
systems. Now I mentioned this idea of a
threshold in this exponentially
expanding space. So this is how we
formalize the origin of life. The origin
of life is when things come become too
complex that a historic a specific
trajectory has to actually scaffold on
itself in order to get to that level of
complexity. It has to build a history
and a memory. Selection has to happen.
There has to be an information
processing system that feeds back on
itself recursively in order to construct
into the future in this
space. That's the origin of life.
Otherwise you get a cominatorial mess of
exploring all possibilities and our
universe cannot do that for complex
things because there are too many to
exist all at once. So it has to make
choices is very anthropocentric
language. But this is why we get to
exist and other things don't because our
entire history has led to our existence
and in fact we are our history. That is
the physical thing that is us. So the
definition of life that I'll offer
tonight is that life is lineages of
propagating information. And it's
actually these causal histories occurred
over um many generations and actually
physical in objects and known physics
exists down here. We don't know this
transition point yet but I think
assembly theory is allowing us to get
close. And the origin of life happens in
chemistry originally. It's the first
cominatorial space a planet generates
where it can't exhaust all possibilities
and if you want to see complex structure
life has to emerge on a planet. And then
the origin of life actually is a
continual process that happens anytime a
new combinatorial space is built. So I
actually think the origin of life is a
process that happens in languages and in
technologies. It's a general process of
generating novelty out of cominatorial
spaces and then allowing complexity to
emerge out of
them. So this is the physics that we're
after is that that actual
process. You might be scratching your
head. It's a little abstract. Um, it was
quite funny when our paper came out. We
had a a paper in nature that was very
deeply theoretical, which was like very
exciting. I have never had a scientific
paper go viral before. Um, so this was
my favorite meme. Uh, and that's the
abstract of our paper. Uh, introducing
the ideas of assembly theory. Obviously,
he's very confused. You might be saying
similar things. It's it's a it's a lot
of things that we folded in to really
try to get at this problem of how life
arises in the universe. So, I think it's
a complex set of topics. I want to talk
for a few minutes uh before wrapping up
about the idea of assembly theory as an
existential technology because I think
one of the reasons that our paper was so
confusing is the language didn't fit. We
we wrote the paper in what I felt like
as a self-consistent language and I
remember these very deep arguments with
Lee. I think we wrote 150 drafts of the
paper with our collaborators and it was
very intense. The language I think was
self-consistent but we use words in ways
that people weren't familiar with. And I
think this is because it is a new idea
and we're trying to really pull a whole
bunch of undercurrens and conceptual
frameworks together and try to build a
new language and therefore hopefully it
offers a new existential technology in
the sense of the history of physics. So
I already mentioned that new theories
offer new concepts of time. Assembly
theory has its own concept of time which
is time is material. Time is a property
of
objects in the sense that we're four
billion years old.
Uh, and you might say, "I'm not allowed
to invent new materials." I know some
people that would beg to differ. Roger
Penrose, Noel Laura in physics, does not
like the word material because it
suggests we know what the material is.
And Madonna lives in a material world.
And I'm pretty sure social reality is
equally real to elementary particles.
And so I think if you look at the
history of physics, the things we call
matter are things we invented
measurements for and could embed
abstract ideas in theories. So why is it
we use mass and acceleration for
understanding motion? It's because we
could measure those things in a very
regular way and they happen to be the
right measurements to actually build
into our theories of motion. But it took
us a long time to figure out what
measurements map to the abstractions.
And so inventing new material realities
I think is something that's very
consistent with the history of physics.
Another concept fundamental unit of life
is not the cell, it's the lineage. And
as I mentioned, you have parts of you
that are four billion years old. So I
have a friend uh Michael Lochman that if
I ask him how old he is, he'll say he's
3.8 billion years old. Those are some of
the that's when we think the origin of
life happened. He looks good for his
age. You all also look great for your
age. Um, so the the idea being that we
have been constructed on this planet
across four billion years and we are the
reason we're not reducible to our atoms.
Why that fundamental layer doesn't
describe us is because when we do that
we remove all of that time and
causation. And that's actually where we
exist. That's where the causal structure
is that is us is embedded in this
history of time. And so I think to
understand life we have to think about
time in a real physical way. And
actually evolved objects, one of the
reasons they're so perplexing for us to
see is because they're bigger in time
than space. Imagine putting four billion
years in this tiny volume of my brain.
Right? That's what we are. Four billion
years of constructed complexity inside a
very small volume.
I think this is one of the reasons that
reality is looking increasingly virtual
as we become increasingly complex
because most of the objects in our world
are now deep in time and our sense
perception has evolved to interact with
the spatial dimension, not the temporal
dimension. Right? And so the power of
theoretical physics has always been to
build abstractions that correspond to
reality and allow us to see reality in
new ways. And we didn't really
understand gravity. We didn't understand
the curvature of the spaceime around us
for most of our history. And I think we
don't understand the causal structures
that were embedded in actually just how
deep they are. And so information looks
like it hops around between physical
materials because it's actually the
structure that is embedded deep in time
and it's just around us
everywhere. If you adopt this view, the
largest known causal structure in the
universe
collectively is our technosphere.
So if we looked at our universe in
spatial
volume, we look very small. But if we
look at it in terms of causal time
volume, our planet is huge. And in fact,
I think right now on our planet, the
largest density of causal volume per
unit mass is the human brain. And this
is one of the reasons that we can
abstract so well. And we haven't
manifested that yet in our technology
because the the sort of causal structure
is much more distributed in terms of
energy per unit, mass etc. The universe
doesn't predict the future. It
constructs it. What it does is predict
the past. The future is undetermined
till it happens. Why? Because in the
complex universe we live, the volume of
things we can create is much larger than
what exists now. There's not enough
information existing now to specify
where we're going.
We actually live in an undeterministic
universe. I think that's completely
consistent with quantum mechanics.
That's a whole separate conversation.
Okay. History and knowledge determine
what's possible. So, I'm showing two
processes that are consistent with the
laws of physics. Launching satellites
into space, building high atomic number
elements. Both of those things can
happen on our planet because of the
knowledge that's been acquired over
billions of years by and then evolving
intelligent systems like us that invent
laws of physics that can launch
satellites into space. Something we
don't see on any other planet and can
create elements that only exist
here. All right, last thing I want to
introduce which is one of my favorite is
first contact in the lab. So we talk a
lot about AI and alien right now. Two
concepts we don't understand. This is
one of the reasons that I'm really
interested in solving the original life.
And most of the time when I say this, I
go places and people are like, "What are
you talking about, Sarah? What does that
even mean?" Um, I'm going to try to
explain what I mean a little bit better
than I have before. I'm hoping I'm
getting there. Um, but the idea
is we actually want to understand how
the universe constructs complexity and
we want to see that history. I want to
see the causal structure underlying us.
I want to understand what that physics
is. So quantifying the ghost in the
machine is we see all of these things
being animated in our environment right
now. All of our technologies are coming
alive, but we actually can't see the
historical contingency that got there.
We can trace information across genomes,
but we can't trace information from
genomic biology into technologies. But
there's information transfer between
those substrates, right? Our
technologies are part of our lineage.
And so we need to be able to actually
see that underlying structure in order
to understand how we're evolving and
co-evolving with the technologies that
we're
creating. So I think we're not going to
discover alien life on another planet
first. I think we're going to discover
it here on Earth first. Hopefully if
we're successful um by building
experiments to search chemical space for
new life forms. The idea being if we can
do that, we can isolate the physics of
that origin life transition and really
understand how is it that our universe
crosses that threshold and starts to
build information processing systems and
construct a
complexity. We're a tiny tiny fragment
of chemical space. This is the Earth's
biosphere's complexity of of chemistry
drawn as a single network. Planetary
chemistry. We exist somewhere in this
giant space. There are probably other
kinds of chemistry. Planets could
generate other kinds of living
chemistry. So, could we build
experiments that can build entirely new
lineages totally different from the one
that emerged on Earth without putting
the design
in, without using ourselves as
intelligent designers. We want to know
how the universe designs
itself. So we're trying to build
experiments that allow searching for the
origin of life in the lab and
understanding the source of novelty and
non-determinism underlying creation. I
actually think there is no description
of the universe from the outside. It's
constructing itself and we want to learn
the rules of
that. So first contact for
me is an event. It's actually contact
like realizing we make a discovery of
alien life. But more important is that
first contact is an existential
technology.
And to conclude, I'm going to use this f
like very good in this
crowd. Um uh about the sort of structure
of the different layers that we all
exist in. Um and part of my reason for
this is I love fashion and I love
theoretical physics. So it's the top and
bottom layer. But I also really deeply
think as I mentioned before that if we
don't work on the base level of our
understanding of reality, the entire
structure starts to become inongruent.
So I think this idea that we need new
fundamental theoretical physics to
understand the time that we're living in
now and what life is and where we're
going is critically important for this
reason. And so with that, I'm going to
thank my lab and my amazing
collaborators and all of you. And thank
you guys.
[Music]
That was amazing. Thanks. It's always
It's always so fun to You're great.
Always so fun to listen to you. I always
learn so much every time. So I have
obviously a million questions. Let maybe
sort of the technosphere and this this
really wonderful sort of paradox that
actually turns out not to be a paradox
after all. um that the technosphere
which has the largest causal structure
embedded within it which is usually
thought of as sort of the newest thing
in this will is actually the oldest
thing in the universe because it has the
most causal structure around it and I
wonder if you could talk a little bit
about differentiate or maybe it's the
same thing whether or not the
causality the sort of accumulated
accumulated causation that has occurred
over these billions of years that is
embedded within this. That's one kind of
causality. But now the technosphere
itself is also causing things, right? It
has a kind of agency perhaps mindless
agency that can cause that's able to do
things that also previously couldn't be
done. Is your mind is there a kind of
necessary symmetry between the amount of
let's say you know evolved causality
that's in something and the amount of
causal agency that thing might have?
Yes.
Okay. So, we're going faster than I
thought. Yeah. No. Um it was fun while
you were talking which often happens
when I have conversations with you. I
build really nice visuals in my head. Um
so I think the way So they're absolutely
related. So things that have the most
causal power in the universe are things
that are deep in time. But it's it's
actually very interesting because you're
most of the the time you can actually
act on your past history. So where
you're causal is the things that are
behind you in time and the things ahead
of you are kind of this noisy horizon.
So I don't think the technosphere will
have a causal power of its own until
there's a larger structure on it. So
it's almost like it's post-selected.
Until there's a larger structure on it.
Yes. In the future at some point. Yes.
What would that be? So we still have
most of the causation. Does that make
you happy or sad?
Um well both. I mean I suppose like what
you also talked about this you ended
with said that we are co-evolving with
our with our technologies right and that
like it's it's selecting on us and we're
selecting on it right as well. So maybe
it's maybe it's both.
Yes. I mean the whole system is being
co-constructed for sure. And so
including including us. Yes. Including
us. And so I think the question of
agency is quite hard because agency is
very distributed for sure and it's also
temporally distributed. So I think I
think it's always interesting you know
the the place this also comes up is like
in questions of free will and there's
like an issue about whether you have
free will or not but free will is a
temporally distributed property and it
depends on the actual causal act that
you're aiming to do. So you know I
couldn't be in Arizona right now because
I'm in San Francisco but I could be in
Arizona tomorrow because I planned
ahead, right? Right? So your free will
is distributed over time and I think
it's the same with these causal
structures that the actual causation
they have is distributed in time. So
it's it's recursively deep. You could
think about one structure but it's many
such interacting structures and they're
all layered. Yeah. Yeah. That's clear to
me anyway. I don't know any
I should have been an artist. It would
have been much easier to communicate.
Yeah.
Um, one of the things that you know
you've been working on lately is this
idea of the uh perceptual horizon. Yes.
Right. Which is maybe I ask you to um
explain it a little bit more as I
understand it. It has to do with the
ways in and this goes a bit to this the
history of science that you that you
showed that different technologies allow
us to perceive the universe in different
ways. And because we can perceive the
universe in different ways, we can
measure it in different ways. And and
this in
essence both enables and constrains the
kind of science that's possible, right?
And so this this horizon is expanding,
right? And perhaps computational
simulations are the latest version of
it. But the idea is that this is not
only changing but in in essence getting
wider or getting getting bigger. And so
I wanted to ask you to explain that a
little bit more. But in the context of
this question, you've said number of
times that you you imagine that when we
when we or when you perhaps human and
leaf discover what life really is,
there'll be something like something
more like the discovery of gravity. Will
that only be possible because the
perceptual horizon has expanded to such
a degree that that level of conceptual
granularity is possible? Yeah. Yeah. Um,
so let me explain for people that
haven't heard me talk about that idea um
before where it comes from. So I usually
use atom atoms as an example, right? So
when atoms as elements uh were
discovered, we thought they were the
like base level of reality, right? So
atom comes from the ancient Greek as a
word. And when we discovered the atomic
elements, we called them atoms because
we we thought they were the substance
everything was made of. But subsequently
we developed technology that allowed us
to see substructure in the atom. And
right now the sort of leading theory of
a fundamental theory of physics is
string theory. And the only reason that
theory is not accepted right now is
because we can't measure that deep in
into so it's it's a technological hurdle
to test ideas of that theory. And so
this brings to the to the forefront this
idea that the horizon of what we call
fundamental actually evolves with our
technology because it evolves with the
way that we can actually measure and
perceive the world. LIGO is another
example. Gravitational waves have been
permeating this planet for billions of
years. But we took you know the
invention of Einstein's general uh
theory of relativity and then LIGO to
detect gravitational waves. Right? So we
build all of these technologies to
perceive the world in new ways. And this
led me to think that the fundamental
things are not at the horizon. They're
all the constructive complexity in the
horizon. Because the way that we
actually expand our ways of knowing, if
we think about ourselves in this causal
bubble, is by building new apparatus to
explore the boundaries of our bubble.
And so if we're doing that, we need to
be large enough as a causal structure to
see the things smaller than us. And I
think this is the transition we're
undergoing now that technologies in
animating more things as alive that
we're doing now is going to fold back
and allow us to understand what life is
because we have to have a large enough
horizon in order to see that physics.
Right? Right. So we can't you you you
can't understand patterns unless you've
observed enough history. Right? So we
don't even know the patterns in our own
history and culture because human
history hasn't been around long enough
for us to actually see regularity there.
So okay so there's a question of I to
come back to in a different way so how
you define the future in relationship to
this but what I'm hearing you say is
that technology is itself a form a form
of life but um that in order there need
to be this expansion of this horizon so
that that that particular form of life
can in essence recursively look back at
itself. So the question I wanted to ask
in this is what would that technology be
like? What might it be? And and and
maybe you already answered part of this.
What would be the preconditions to its
appearance? So I think this is why I was
talking about theories as existential
technologies because I think what good
theories do is they allow you to see the
world in a new way and that's actually
the scaffold for embedding the
measurement. So I see as one of the
critical technologies the conceptual
development of assembly theory which is
you know a multi- collaborative effort
but also I think some of them are going
to be the
actual instruments in the lab and
artificial intelligence to some extent
as a tool for measurement. I Well, let
me let me ask you then about the uh
artificial intelligence because it
seems, you know, this is an area where
there's a lot of already attention paid
to a kind of co-evolutionary dynamic of
this of this as well. Um, and there's in
many ways a lot of focus on the role of
AI as a kind of collaborator within
within science and you're sort of
suggesting them as more like a
microscope. Uhhuh. So if you're looking
at structures that are so large, you
need to be able to process the data and
cool it like microscopes allow us to see
tiny structures and telescopes allow us
to see distant
structures. Artificial intelligence
algorithms allow us to see large
patterns like the periphery of very
large causal structures but just the
surface layer. And so I think the idea
of having a theory that allows us to
understand the historical contingency
that gets to these very large complex
systems is the other piece of it. So
assembly theory to me is the underlying
architecture of how you get to this data
layer that we exist in now. And AI is
the technology of seeing that data
layer. Uhhuh. Yeah. I like that. What is
the role of mind in assembly in assembly
theory? Yeah, I this is something I've
thought a lot about and and Lee and I
have talked a lot about and also with
our groups. I think minds are are very
deep in assembly space. So I think like
the examples I like to give are things
like uh perfect circles. Perfect circles
are objects that can't exist as physical
structures in the world, right? Because
you can't have infinite precision to
make them perfect, but they're an idea
that exists in our minds. So I think I
talked about this idea of the
virtualization of reality. I think
there's a lot of the space that exists
in this kind of virtual causal structure
that actually can't be physical objects
on their own but they can exist in a
virtual space in that virtual causal
time as a space sorry not physical then
not coordinate space but like you know
this cominatorial space um and so so I
think what's interesting about minds is
because of this very large depth in time
and the ability to reach into those very
abstract layers there's much more things
that we can manipulate about our
environment and much more creativity we
can induce in the world because we have
access to these internally very large
causal spaces. So, so most so to me our
ability to abstract is just evidence of
how deep in time we are and those sort
of those abstractions though they're
kind of idealizations you give an
example of the circle but you also but
you would differentiate that I believe I
mean perhaps mathematics would count as
one of these abstractions you would
differentiate this from neoplatonism yes
where the you know the followers of
neoplato right so um yeah I'm not a
platonist I like plonist I have a like I
have an allergic reaction to platonism I
don't know what it is. Like it's I'm
literally allergic to it intellectually.
The reason being I I don't um like I
think I think it's it's much more
constructive and and this is probably
the materialist in me and I'm not sure
if it's the Madonna or Penrose version
of the materialist um because both are
juxaposed in my mind. To me, reality is
great. Um and there's no reason with
thinking that like anything exists more
than what exists here. And I think if we
fold all of that in and we really think
about the things in our mind and these
abstract ideas we have as physical
features of our reality and not in some
imagined reality out there, it tells us
much more about what's actually
happening. And
so the way that I think about
abstractions is I want to know what the
abstractions themselves are as physical
architectures. And so mathematics to me
is particularly interesting because
mathematics is supposed to be a
universal language and it corresponds to
a lot of objects in the world but really
what it is is like our mind's ability to
actually causally influence the future
because of the kind of patterns that
exist in our own architecture. And so I
see math as not and science actually
generally not as predictive but as
constructive as I mentioned in the talk
that these things that we do are
actually part of the mechanism of how
our planet is generating possibilities
and moving into the future and I think
that's actually much more helpful
because it gives us a lot of agency and
control over things and a lot more
understanding about us fundamentally
than assuming there's some reality out
there that we don't have access to yet
that reality is somehow supervening on
us and controlling
And this is also where the I think
corresponds with your your insistence
about materiality of information. Yes.
Right. Right. This is not a this is this
is a real thing. I mean if it kicks it's
real information. I mean I mean I don't
think there's anybody in this room that
doubts that information is influencing
their life. Like I I just I think
there's no there's no sense to think
that these things are not physical.
Yeah. This goes a little bit to the this
relationship between assembly theory and
philosophy of science once again. um
what are the falsifiable predictions
that assembly theory can make? So one of
them is that you could have arbitrarily
high complexity objects happen outside
of an evolutionary process and so far we
haven't observed that. So we don't we
don't observe you know cell phones
spontaneously fluctuating into existence
on Mars for example they exist on our
planet. Um that would be counter to
assembly theory. I also think uh you
know one of the tests that Lee and I
have been talking about is the idea that
there's a minimal construction time for
any object. And so you know Lee's a
brilliant experimentalist. I think if
anybody could figure out how to do it uh
he would but it's a tough problem but if
you if you could devise an experiment to
actually demonstrate that something
can't fluctuate into existence and it
requires some history. So what would
that experiment be? You know, we get
asked a lot about experimental tests and
I think there are many that we will
devise just like gravity has many tests,
but there's also this idea of
explanations, right? And so gravity is a
language that we now use to describe
this regularity of like why we're stuck
to our chairs, but it's also something
like our ancestors observed and their
ancestors observed. And so I think there
are like deep things we know about the
world and we don't have languages for.
And I think assembly theory is a
language for this deep regularity. And
so in some sense I don't I don't know
how you test an explanation that seems
obvious. Do you see what I mean? It's
it's like it's a hard thing to do. Um
and so you can test the the sort of
features of the mathematical theory and
if it fits, but I also really believe
that this deep layer of what science is
doing is building better explanations
and the explanations are what carry us
forward. And so I don't know what to do
with that. I think uh I think I think
science is much more varied
uh than people traditionally. I I really
like this idea of epistemological
anarchy in science. Paul fire yeah um
yeah okay here's an experiment for you.
Um, mass spectrometry may help measure
assembly index for
molecules, but how do you measure more
complex or abstract forms of quote
unquote life like uh a technology or a
culture? So, the challenge we have with
assembly theory right now is we think
the theory is quite general, but
developing it for new substrates to test
the principles is quite hard. So, we've
done it for two in a rigorous way so
far. one is molecules and the second one
is crystal materials like minerals and
silicon chips. Um and so there you can
tell the difference between a natural
min mineral and a technologically
engineered mineral uh which we call
silicon in a very precise way in
assembly theory. But the challenge we
have is this idea of assembly index has
to be embedded in a measurement scheme.
So you have to have some way of actually
deconstructing what you think the
causation in the object is. not your
model of the causation but what that how
the universe actually generates that
structure in terms of what causal
constraints what laws of physics are at
play and you have to and you have to be
able to look at this the that as a
substrate specific property so once you
can build the assembly space for the
material then you can apply assembly
theory but the assembly space is very
non-trivial because I and this is where
assembly theory I think fundamentally
differs from computation because
computation is this like we can build
computational models for everything but
there's one assembly space for a
particular selective mechanism. And so
the universe might be a self-
constructing system and all of these
spaces have different sets of laws and
constraints in them and different kinds
of contingency and assembly spaces can
be nested in other assembly spaces. Um
and so I think
I what we need to do is to demonstrate
it in enough materials to show that life
is a general phenomena. That's what I'm
interested in actually. So I I think the
question is also about things that we
that you would call real and physical
like a culture. Yep. But are aren't
necessarily material in the same sort of
way. And so the question is how like
presumably
some cultures are more like some
languages are more complex than other
but but the question becomes hard right
so which substrate do you use for
constructing the assembly space of
language? Do you use vocalization? Do
you use written word? Do you use what's
actually imprinted in computers? And so
without actually understanding the
architecture of how these things are
embedded in the substrate like we don't
know what they are you know I think like
language for example like people think
we understand language language is a set
of patterns that some entities on this
planet iterate like utter to other
entities on the planet right like so if
we're looking at that as an objective
thing outside of ourselves and asking
what is that as a physical causal
structure it's a highly non-trivial
problem
um and so I think I think it's possible
um but I don't want to give you easy
answers to it because I think it's a
really hard challenge. Yeah, fair
enough. If there are other substrates
that on which life can form, are there
be other substrates that can hold minds?
And the other question which is probably
related to this which is interest phrase
and interesting way when is AI life.
Okay. When is an interesting way of
getting that? So I think any substrate
that has enough cominatorial richness
kind of an open maybe an uncomputable
one. So I talked about the fact that all
all possible molecules are actually not
computable like we don't have enough
resources in the entire planet to
generate all of chemical space in a
model.
Um there are some so those are the ones
that I think are interesting because
they're capable of open-ended
complexity. I think that's actually the
one that we're interested with respect
to life. Now one place that we've
applied assembly theory actually there's
one other substrate I didn't mention
which is an atmosphere. So, uh,
molecules, minerals, and and
atmospheres. I think we're pretty
confident on atmospheres because we're
interested in life detection on
exoplanets. And atmospheres are kind of
interesting because they're not
combinatorially rich. There's about
16,000 volatile molecules that probably
could be in an atmosphere. So, it's a
really small space. And so, I think if
you look at the transition to life in an
exoplanet atmosphere, the the sort of
selection constraints you see are very
weak. So I think we can pick up
signatures of it, but it's not this very
sharp transition. So I think living
worlds in terms of the imprint of
selection in their atmosphere are on
kind of a continuum with non-living
worlds. But I think there's still a
transition we can pick up. But
substrates that have very deep
combinatorial rich structure can enter
an open end cascade. Those are the
things that we really call living.
Again, distinction between life and
living. Yeah. And the ones that are very
deep structures in that space can have
minds. And I think AI
is shallow right now. But I think the
integrated structure of our technologies
on this planet is getting deeper. But
any particular model to me is is still a
very shallow system. Again, it goes back
to this idea of like are you processing
the data at the outer periphery, which I
think is what we're doing right now, or
are you building structures that are
deep? And so it's very unclear to me
about how the predictive algorithms are
are they things that we're interacting
with and we're seeing them as being
causally deep because we're deep. But
the actual embedding of that and the
physical architecture might be still
quite shallow. But so that's the
question is is are they are they
experiencing are they act like what is
what is the what is the reality of a
silicon chip processing a large language
model?
You don't want to ask about the output,
right? The output is what we read on a
screen. It's a it's a predictive. What
is it like to be a chip? What is it like
to be a large language model embedded in
a physical architecture? I don't think
any of us know what that is. No, I don't
think any of us do know what it is. But
presumably on the on the depth question
um that you know that if if it is
essentially something that we have made,
we sort of invested our depth in this
and when we're with part of the
technosphere that there would be a lot
of evolutionary time embedded in these
large embedded in these large models
like the things. You put you put a lot
of time in in a small space, but most of
that time is just the linguistic
component right now or or certain kinds
of structure of the p just just to use
llens as an example. Yeah. Evolution of
language in that regard. That's right.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're and and I
think I think the thing that's
interesting to me is is the interaction
with words, right? So words are shifting
meaning all the time. And if I asked
everybody in well, we did ask this what
what is life? like there were probably
as many different answers for that as
there are people in the room, right? So,
so the fact that there's a predictive
correlation between that word and other
words doesn't necessarily capture all
the conceptual foundations underneath
it. And so I think again it goes back to
the causal richness of the history and
how we actually build meaning is mostly
about our physical architecture, not
these predictive associations of words.
Yes. which is why we have disinformation
issues and all these other things
because you have people with radically
different causal histories interacting
and the words mean totally different
things and they're trying to like cloud
each other's perceptions of reality and
it's really easy to do with the surface
layer if you're not seeing the structure
underneath and you're not seeing the
experience of an individual you can
assume they have bad intentions when
they don't yeah I mean there's a whole
another question about spatial AI or
analog which has to do with more sort of
embedded knowledge but that's that's be
another talk um we need to wrap it up
here um and I just want to first of all
say thank you on behalf of the whole
audience for this such a rich body of
ideas to think with um as assembly
theory as a scaffold for many things to
come next and sort of thanks thanks for
this thanks for your time. Yeah.
