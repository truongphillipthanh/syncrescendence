# The Post-Labor Enterprise

## Executive Summary
David Shapiro argues AI will "refactor" rather than obliterate the economy—rewriting how things work while achieving identical results. Post-labor economics eliminates labor (paid human work) but not scarcity. Scarcity resolves to physics: time, mass, distance, heat. Firms persist in post-labor world for economies of scale and capital risk management—Apple doesn't acquire Foxconn because Foxconn spreads capital risk across multiple clients and retains flexibility. TSMC, AWS similarly exist because multi-client economies of scale beat vertical integration.

## Key Insights

### Refactoring, Not Obliteration
AI as economic refactoring: rewriting the system to achieve identical results through entirely different methods. Like software refactoring with better tools/hardware, the economy gets faster, more efficient, more robust using lessons learned.

### Post-Labor ≠ Post-Scarcity
Elimination of labor does not eliminate scarcity. Scarcity resolves to physics:
- **Time**: Processes require duration (immutable)
- **Mass**: Atoms required and their quantity
- **Distance**: Logistics, moving energy/goods A→B
- **Heat/Energy**: Even in abundance must be transformed into useful forms

Cognitive and labor hyperabundance doesn't erase other inputs.

### Four Factors of Production Evolution
- **Land**: Persists (raw materials, physical space)
- **Labor**: Declines as AI/robots mature
- **Capital**: Becomes MORE critical (chips, robots, fusion plants)
- **Entrepreneurship**: Persists (organization, risk-taking)

Descends to land + capital as persistent scarcity factors.

### Why Firms Persist Post-Labor

**Internalization (SpaceX/Raptor)**: Defensive response to market failure, not preference. Will externalize when external supply improves.

**Economies of Scale (Apple/Foxconn)**: Apple doesn't absorb Foxconn despite being sole buyer because:
- Foxconn spreads capital risk across Dell, Sony, Amazon, Samsung
- Factory retooled every 12 months—capital risk management
- Multi-client flexibility enables efficiencies Apple can't match

**Same Logic Scales**: TSMC (multi-client chip fab), AWS (buy servers externally, own data centers). Even with AI/robots, organizational structures solve problems technology alone cannot.

### Core Firm Functions
1. Provision of goods and services
2. Risk management (often overlooked but essential)

Firms persist not because labor is needed but because they solve: capital risk, economies of scale, rapid adaptation, efficient resource allocation.

## Transcript

Hey folks, David Shapiro here. Um, so
I've been kicking around this idea of
what I call the post labor enterprise,
which is an extension of post-labor
economics because here's the thing is
some people out there are, you know, and
and to be fair, this is this is kind of
a niche group. Um, I'm not going to say
fringe because it's still a common
enough idea in the tech bro space like
Silicon Valley and AI space where they
think that artificial intelligence is
going to upend and rewrite the entire
economy. Now, uh, I tend to prefer to
think of it as refactoring. Um, and the
and refactoring is still a tech bro
term. And if you're not familiar with
refactoring, refactoring is where you
rewrite software to achieve the same
exact result, but with an an entirely
different uh sometimes newer and better
method. Um, so if you fudge through a
program the first time around, you kind
of, you know, have spaghetti code and it
it's all messy and stuff, but then you
get a new ability, whether it's a bigger
server, more memory, more RAM, a better
database, or whatever else, or you even
switch programming languages entirely,
you rewrite your entire codebase with
all the lessons learned from the
previous version, but you do it better.
So it'll be faster, more efficient, more
robust, and that sort of thing. So I
tend to think that artificial
intelligence and robotics are going to
refactor the economy rather than upend
it and rewrite it from scratch. And this
is what we call post-labor economics.
And one of the primary things that we're
changing about the operating system is
the need for labor. [clears throat] And
labor is uh so for the for the sake of
of clarity and definitions, labor is
something that you pay humans to do. Um,
the reason that you pay humans to do it
is because until now only humans could
do it. So, for the sake of this show,
this podcast, we're going to assume a
few things. Um, first, that artificial
intelligence is going to continue on the
trend that it has been and that it's
going to continue improving uh to the
point that it is smarter than humans at
basically all cognitive tasks. Uh, that
seems like a foregone conclusion,
particularly in controlled environments.
Uh but it's also pretty good at
improvising. Um some people out there
are going to bulk at this idea like oh
well it can't it can't handle anything
outside of its training distribution.
But the thing is is that most humans
can't either. And certainly in a firm or
an enterprise um very few things are
actually outside of training
distribution. uh and and what I mean by
that is that a human has has already
faced the problems that like 99.99%
of the problems that you will face
inside any firm someone else has already
figured out and anyways the science is
showing that um that the that AI is now
able to generate novel insights even in
science which you know uh the cutting
edge of science is where there is you
know you'd have zero training data so um
yeah so let's just for the sake of
argument, we're going to reject the idea
that, you know, there's there's such
novel unique tasks that uh AI has never
seen that businesses need to confront
because certainly if you're in the
research space, sure, but more and more
researchers are using AI to help them.
So, the other thing, the other
assumption that we're going to make is
that humanoid robots are on the up and
up and that very soon humanoid robots
will also be able to replace human
labor. they'll be better, faster,
cheaper, and safer than human physical
labor. Um, and that artificial
intelligence in the form of foundation
models like transformers and language
models will be better, faster, and
cheaper and safer than human brains. Um,
so with those two assumptions, we can
make a third optional assumption, which
is that even something like nuclear
fusion might be coming down the
pipeline, which will basically make
energy for all intents and purposes free
compared to what it is today. Um, but we
don't even need to make that assumption.
I'm just pointing out that that's a
possibility. Now, even if you accept all
three of those assumptions, the reason
that we call it post- labor economics
and post- labor enterprise rather than
post scarcity is because it doesn't
erase scarcity. Um, anyone with with a
uh even a mild education in business or
economics will understand, okay, great.
Even if you have cognitive
hyperabundance, even if you have labor
hyperabundance, that doesn't erase all
the other inputs that go into your
business. Um, so for instance, uh, one
of the first like principles, you know,
tech bros love thinking in first
principles. So one of the first
principles, economic constraints becomes
physics. Time, mass, distance, and heat.
So time processes still take time. Mass
has to do with the atoms that you want
and and how much they weigh and how many
of them there are. Um so that's
materials. And then distance, which is
logistics, getting stuff from A to B. Um
whether that's moving energy around,
whether it's moving goods around, um
getting raw materials and getting it to
where it needs to go. Um and then
finally, heat or energy. Um and you
still need to manage heat and energy
even if you have a hyperabundance of it.
Um you need to condition it. So here
here's a here's a perfect example. We
have a hyperabundance of air, right? But
even so, um you still need to make sure
that if you're using air in an
industrial process, you need to filter
it, you need to clean it, you need to
condition it. Um so even when you have a
hyperabundant resource, that doesn't
mean that it's readymade. Likewise, if
you have a hyperabundance of heat from
nuclear fusion, that doesn't mean that
it's immediately in the form and shape
that you need it to be in. You might
need to have three-phase electricity.
You might need to have two-phase
electricity. You might need 480 volts.
You might need 120. You might need
something else. Who knows? So, um that's
the premise. So, let's talk about the
enterprise or or firms. So, um on a
broader perspective when you say like
what's the what is the economy? What is
the factor of productivity? Uh what is
the market? And so, uh it breaks down uh
the the orthodox view is that it breaks
down into four categories. land, labor,
capital, and entrepreneurship. And
entrepreneurship is the organization
itself, the risk-taking function. Um,
and also firms, one of the primary roles
of a firm is, of course, the provision
of goods and services. That's the
output. But one of the primary things
that they do is risk management. And
we're going to talk about that in more
in just a minute. Now land which is raw
materials, physical space, uh any place
that you can perform extraction or
storage and u of of capital that's not
going anywhere. That's that's always
going to have a cost. And of course land
is variable depending on how close it is
to um your producers, your suppliers,
your consumers and so on. So even even
if we have unlimited labor and unlimited
uh cognitive labor and unlimited energy,
land as an input is not going anywhere.
Now factor number two, labor which is
human input uh human effort uh and human
time that my argument is uh will be
going away over the next uh few years uh
as as these technologies improve. And
then capital, which is, you know, the
money, the machinery, the
infrastructure, the investments, that's
actually going to become even more
important because guess what? All of
your AI chips and all of your robots and
all of your nuclear fusion plants, those
are capital. Um, so capital will become
even more important. So we're we're down
to basically land and capital. And then
entrepreneurship, which is the
risk-taking function. Um, that is that's
actually that's actually several
dimensions. So one is there's the legal
risk takingaking.
One of the reasons that a firm exists is
is to is for legal liability purposes.
Artificial intelligence won't change
that at all. Um because when you when
you are operating uh in a complex
civilization, someone needs to be on the
hook. Which means even if the even if a
company has zero employees, whoever owns
the company is going to be on the hook.
So they're uh assuming the legal risk.
But then there's the financial risk.
There's the there's the uh there's the
you know the costbenefit analysis of
saying hey can we actually produce this
good good or service at a profit yes or
no. Um and so then there's there's you
know if they take out loans or whatever
or if they have uh shareholders that
they have a fiduciary duty towards again
artificial intelligence won't erase
that. Although one of the primary uh
ideas here is that if we have super
intelligent AI um that is better,
faster, cheaper and safer than all
humans at all cognitive tasks that
includes CEOs and boards and presidents
and directors. Uh meaning that uh that
AI can can do all of the work, all of
the labor of even running the business.
Um, but that doesn't erase the legal
liability as well as the financial
liability even if it would be a better
CEO than a human. So, you still have a
human assuming behind it all the
financial and legal risk. U, but you
don't you probably won't have a human
CEO anymore. Um, it'll just be an AI CEO
reporting to the human owner. Um, so but
that becomes just more capital. So
through one lens you can say okay the
entire economy becomes land and capital
labor and entrepreneurship mostly go
away it just becomes more like land
capital and liability really. So that's
one way to think of it. Um so then when
we look at the physical bottlenecks we
say okay let's just take you know an
example of steel or land. And so steel
is you know iron ore which is transmuted
into uh into usable steel. You've got
lithium, lumber, silica, water. All of
these are raw materials that uh still
take time and energy to produce and
move. So that's the mass. So when we're
looking at the physics bottleneck of
inputs, you've got mass, which is the
materials and the land and that sort of
thing. So that's atoms because some
people I've seen this comment out there
where some people try and simplify it.
It's like, oh, you're just rearranging
atoms. Yes, but rearranging atoms is is
a non-trivial problem. When you look at
for instance just the complexity of
making uh uh wafers for for uh
processors um the the process of making
silicon chips is so incredibly complex
that only a few companies in the world
are capable of doing it. Um and so yes
you're just you're quote just
rearranging atoms unquote but that
doesn't make it easy. Um and so the
process is is very difficult even if the
raw materials are abundant and cheap
such as silicon. Now um so uh so supply
chains raw material extraction those
become very important. So even just
permission to extract resources, uh that
would that would increase competition,
increase market competition because then
if everyone and their brother is smart
enough to spin up a steel mill or a or a
chip factory or whatever, uh then
everyone's going to want to do it, uh
everyone with with any capital
whatsoever is going to be able to say,
"Hey, I want to I want to set up a new
factory or a new foundry or something
like that." So that'll intensify
competition around mass which is you
know land and materials. Then distance
you know the logistics part um you know
it's not it's not just uh geographic
distance but it's also last mile. So
there let's look at this from the macro
scale and the micro scale. So distance
still becomes an issue. One thing that I
that I personally think might happen is
that labor arbitrage will collapse.
meaning it's not going to be
economically viable to have um to have
your your your factories and your
warehouses in Thailand and Vietnam and
ship everything to America because that
time distance is going to be a lag when
you can just have the same factories in
America making the goods and services
that uh that are going to be sold
locally. So you can you can beat the
market if you set up local and sell
local. Uh now you might say okay well
but what if energy is more expensive in
America? I would say energy will
probably be cheaper in America because
we're going to be the ones that can
invest in that infrastructure. So
distance or logistics becomes an issue.
But then also so that's that that was on
the macro scale which is you know long
longdistance shipping and that sort of
thing. In some cases you don't have a
choice. So for instance, if you're
mining something like lithium uh or
other rare earth metals or even pot ash,
right? Uh there's there's uh certain
mines are going to produce goods in
certain places and you don't have an
option. So in some cases you do have the
arbitrage option. In other cases you
don't. It's simply the forest is here,
the farm is there. Uh you know the the
sulfur is there, the lithium is over
there. Uh so things are going to have a
physical location which you can't argue
with. Um and it needs to get from there
to somewhere else. Uh because you know
for instance wherever your wherever your
your phosphorus mine is is probably not
going to be where your farms are. Uh and
anyways you need to sell it to a market.
So logistics isn't going anywhere. Even
if we have autonomous trucks and drones
to handle the delivery in the last mile
and all that stuff, you're still going
to have the economic inputs of trains
and planes and boats, uh, which means
that those are those resources aren't
going anywhere. Um, it's just your your
your iPhone might say made in America
rather than made in Foxcon, wherever
Foxcon is, Thailand, Vietnam, China. And
then time, process latency.
So everything still takes time. It takes
time to grow trees. It takes time to uh
you know make those make those wafers
for the chips. It takes time uh for
fabrication whether that's melting and
and and mixing cooling. So there's
chemical processes, there's physical
processes, there's thermal processes,
there's biological processes. And yes,
in many cases throughout history,
technology and science have allowed us
to find new processes that are faster,
but few things are instantaneous. And
also thermodynamics is kind of uh is
kind of a cruel mistress where you can't
really argue with thermodynamics. If if
it takes a certain amount of time for a
chemical reaction to happen, the time is
the time. You cannot rush nature. So
that's going to be something that you're
you're still going to be managing as as
a dimension of risk as a firm in the
future even if you have zero employees.
And then finally, heat or thermodynamics
itself or energy more broadly. So that
is that is going to be computation.
There's there's energy input um which is
you know you you you basically take heat
and you use it to spin turbines to power
the data center and then you have waste
heat inside the data centers. Then you
have manufacturing which is everything
from you know drills and and screws to
melting and smelting. All of that
generates waste heat. Um it also
requires thermal inputs uh or other
energy inputs. dissipating it, applying
it, managing it, conditioning it, all of
that is still going to be uh again, you
can't overwrite physics, not even with
advanced AI and and robots.
So that's and also by the way, that's
just a first principles. That's just a
physics-based first principles look at
what remains scarce and economically
valuable in the future. That's not even
talking about the regulation, the
financial aspect, the uh, you know,
which is, you know, the stock market,
your your your banks, your debt, uh,
your credit, all of that other stuff.
Uh, legal legal risk, um, permissions,
you know, license to drill, uh, those
sorts of things. All of those are are
are, I guess you could say, second
second order consequences, but still
first principles of doing business. None
of that's going anywhere uh with
artificial intelligence and robotics.
The AI might be a better lawyer, but
you're still going to need to argue the
law. So then you say, okay, well, what
does what does the firm actually have
that that is valuable? Because if if
basically what we're arguing is that
tribal knowledge and specialized
knowledge goes away as a moat. So
physical infrastructure is is going to
be a big thing which is who owns the
robots, who owns the data centers, who
owns the factories, uh those sorts of
things that is going to become a new
deep moat for many uh for many
companies. And this is by the way this
is going to apply to more than just tech
companies. Um if if your business is
software, your margins are going to get
razor thin because guess what? Everyone
is going to be able to produce software.
Uh however, if you own physical
infrastructure, if you own the data
center, if you own the fields, if you
own the mine, if you own the railroads
or or at least the the rail cars uh and
the ships, you're going to have a much
deeper moat just for the fact that those
again looking at the first principles,
those things are big and heavy and
required a lot of heat to manufacture.
Resource access is going to be another
thing. So, who has the most secure
contracts uh or licenses or permission
for those raw materials? Um where where
do you have permission to operate your
data center? Um so, that's going to be
something that's going to be really
valuable because you know, one of the
things that that that goes into whether
it's a factory or a ship or a foundry um
or a data center is it requires a lot of
permission to even make those things. So
even if you ignore natural resources and
extraction for a minute, the permission
to build those those valuable resources,
those capital assets is still going to
be something that's very valuable. And
someone who has the the capital, the
wherewithal, the intelligence to do all
that. Now, of course, you're going to
have AI that'll help you. Like I could I
could stop right now and just ask Gemini
or Chad GPT like, "Hey, I've got a
billion dollars." And it's going to
believe me because the AI, you know,
takes the user credibly. It's like, "I
have a billion dollars. I want to build
a data center. Help me find the best
place to build a data center so I can
capitalize on artificial intelligence.
It'll help me do that. Um, now you might
say, well, don't don't trust it at face
value, which of course right now is
true. Um, so you you give that same
problem to every AI chatbot you have
access to and then you mle it over to
make a better decision. But in a couple
years when you give that you know that
that query to chat GPT6 or 7 and you
give that query to Gemini 4 um the
answer that it gives you will probably
be the best answer assuming that you
gave it adequate context. So physical
infrastructure resource access those are
two of the first pillars of corporate
value in the future. logistics. Um, so
you know, this this the ability to
shorten time that I already mentioned.
Can you get the raw material to the
consumer faster? Uh, that's going to be
that's going to be uh hugely valuable in
the future. Um, now in some cases that
might mean colllocation uh the
manufacturer and consumption, but in
some cases it's not. In some cases, it's
still going to go down to good
old-fashioned rails, sales, and planes.
I guess we don't use sales anymore, but
you get the idea. Um, trains, boats, and
airplanes. Those aren't going anywhere.
Uh, and then finally, something that
might be really valuable is the
proprietary artificial intelligence and
robots. You might have something that
is, you know, your off-the-shelf AI and
robots might not be good enough for your
specific job. Uh, so if you do have
proprietary AI or proprietary data or
proprietary robots, that could also be a
really big moat.
Now you might say, "Okay, I'm following
along, but so what? What's the practical
takeaway here?" Now the the practical
takeaway um I my current working
hypothesis is that it comes from Ronald
Kos's and I'm I don't know if I'm saying
that right. It's co a s e ronald co or
co um his theory of the firm which I
think he wrote in the 1930s. It's this
is a pretty old idea.
uh basically said that that the
boundaries of a firm are for
internalizing transaction costs. So
basically the idea is whenever you can
do something more efficiently inside of
a firm boundary or inside of a
corporation you should do it otherwise
you should just buy that good or service
from the market. Uh so in that case when
we look at vertical integration this
vertical integration is one of the
consequences of this idea. Now one guy
who takes vertical integration to the
nth degree is Elon Musk with things like
Tesla and SpaceX. So, the idea is that
rather than buying all of your your
bespoke Tesla parts from a Tesla
supplier and the supplier exists only to
serve Tesla or only to serve SpaceX,
that doesn't make any sense because
they're they're taking their transaction
fees. Um, you know, they've got the
middleman. You know, that company that
you're buying from has a profit motive.
So, rather than contracting out someone
to build this the Raptor engines, they
internalized it. And arguably you can
say the Raptor engine is the thing that
makes SpaceX different because their
rockets are braindead simple. They're
just stainless steel tubes, but it's the
Raptor engine that that and all of the
inputs that go into the Raptor engine
that really differentiates SpaceX. Now,
you can say there's also the software
control plane. Um, but again, like he
used Tesla motors for the control
surfaces. There's nothing super exotic
there. And um even hobbyists have been
able to recreate uh self-landing
rockets. Now um so the software the
physics none of that is a moat but if
you look again those the rearranging
atoms can be really difficult in
designing really good rocket engines
that is that is a deeper moat. So and of
course now also SpaceX has permission to
launch. So that's another that's another
part of their moat. So that vertical
integration has reduced their labor cost
and reduced their their their material
costs. Now, based on the premise we're
outlining that in the future, artificial
intelligence and robotics basically
erases labor costs. For all intents and
purposes, labor is no longer a primary
input to business. So then you say,
okay, well, uh, the reason for most
outsourcing disappears when AI and
robotics eliminate labor costs. any
reason that you would have outsourced to
a contractor or a subcontractor if the
labor was was one of the reasons you
say, "Okay, I'm going to let someone
else manage the labor so that I can just
focus on my business." That doesn't make
sense anymore. So, the friction for
internalizing whatever it is that you
outsourced goes away. Then when AI is
superhuman intelligence and possesses
all specialized knowledge or can
generate any specialized knowledge then
outsourcing to someone else for their
their expertise saying ah you know like
let's just say for instance I wanted to
buy Raptor engines and it's like well I
don't have the expertise to make or
design Raptor engines so I'm just going
to buy them from SpaceX. I know they're
probably never going to sell them
because it's like that's their that's
their their cash cow, but just as an
example, because the Raptor engine is
the best rocket engine on the planet
right now. If I wanted to buy them, I
couldn't. But in about 5 to 10 years,
artificial intelligence will be able to
design a better Raptor engine in 5
minutes. So then specialized tribal
knowledge is no longer a moat either. So
the firm boundary and one of the best
ways to understand the firm boundary is
do I do it myself? Do I make it or do I
buy it internal or external. So it's no
longer determined by labor management or
knowledge gaps. It is it is then
entirely
almost entirely determined by capital
and physics. Now here's an example.
Here's a thought experiment. Uh SpaceX
versus Apple. So SpaceX has uh decided
to internalize. So there's, you know, I
disagree with some of these assessments
that say like there's no market for
Raptor engines. There is a huge market
for Raptor engines, but it is much more
efficient and and and potent for SpaceX
to have their own to have their bespoke
uh their own internal supplier for
Raptor engines. Now if if the space
industry were to proliferate, you might
have a market for for space engines or
space engines rocket engines uh but
right now the most efficient thing that
they can do is defend their moat by
saying hey we are going to do this
internally
and and be our own supplier. Now, that
was was a defensive move. And of course,
SpaceX is going to continue to do to do
that until such a time that someone else
can just make off-the-shelf Raptor
engines that are better and cheaper than
what they can do internally. Um, because
if they can't do it better internally,
either due to economies of scale or or
that sort of thing. Now, that that's
another thing. Economies of scale are
still a really big reason for firms to
exist. Now, let's talk about that and
let's compare SpaceX to Apple.
Apple famously still uses Foxcon to
produce all of their iPhones. Now, you
might say, "Ah, well, this is a perfect
example because iPhones, the only the
only uh uh supplier for iPhones is
Foxcon, and the only purchaser of
iPhones is Apple for them to resell. So
why don't they internalize that so that
they can uh so that they can cut out the
middleman and cut out rentse seeeking
behavior. The primary reason and this
this was surprising to me as I was doing
research. The primary reason is risk is
capital risk.
Apple does not want to own billions of
dollars of factories that must be
retoled every 12 months that only
produce one thing. Instead, the
flexibility that f that Foxcon offer
offers because of their economies of
scale means that they produce
uh goods and services or primarily goods
their services assembly for Dell, Sony,
Amazon, Samsung, everyone else. The
factory itself is the economy of scale.
So even in this hypothetical future,
Apple will probably still outsource the
production of its iPhones because it's
it's a standardized commodity and they
want to be able to produce it at scale.
So instead of owning all the capital
internally, Foxcon, which will be using
the same artificial intelligence and
robots and eventually nuclear fusion,
will still probably be able to produce
iPhones cheaper than Apple could simply
due to economies of scale. Meaning that
even in a post-labor world, Foxcon
probably still exists. And there's
probably still a very good reason to
have that firm boundary. And when I mean
firm as in like corporation, the
corporate boundary between Foxcon and
Apple because what Foxcon is
fundamentally doing is not just the
economy of scale. It is also
amateurizing or redistributing risk. it
is managing risk by distributing it over
multiple uh uh purchasers of the the
devices that they make. The now I could
see the same thing happening to the
rocket engine market in the future
particularly as more nations and more
companies want to shoot stuff into
space. SpaceX their moat might just be
economies of scale to produce Raptor
engines at scale. Uh now of course right
now they have launch permission um which
is itself a very very deep mode getting
FAA approval and you know launching from
Texas and wherever else they launch
from. I think they mostly launch from
Texas now. Anyways so you get the idea.
So the the capital risk uh and an
economy of scale is a is still a very
interesting reason to keep uh to keep
firm boundaries in a post labor world.
Now, uh, so outlining that it would
still be economically rational for Apple
to buy their iPhones from, uh, Fox Con
is is is, uh, okay, I've made the point.
Moving on.
Now, so when we say when we look at
that, what we're looking at, let's just
let's just keep the the Fox Con model is
what they're offering, the service that
they are offering is not just saying,
"Hey, we'll produce your goods for you."
What they're really offering is rapid
retooling because that's their
specialty. They have they have the
infrastructure, right? They have the
capital to say, "Oh, hey, you know, we
we have this factory. We have all the
tools, all the all the industrial
processes, all the equipment, which
means we can make any number of
electronics. Just ask and we can scale
up production." So, rapid retooling and
risk management are really the services
that Foxcon will be offering. um that
well it's what they're already offering
but that it will be their primary
service offering in the future. Now
wherever the Foxcon factory happens to
be that might change. So for instance um
you might you might move the factory
closer to the consumers uh and when you
look at the fact that America is a
gigantic consumer of these of uh you
know things like iPhones and and Sony uh
devices and that sort of thing. You
might colllocate it with the chip fabs
that are going up in America as well. So
that'll cut down on transit costs.
But that's a strategic decision for
Foxcon to make. Um but what they're
really offering the service is risk
management via capital absorption. Um so
Apple's just as an example to
differentiate cap the Apple's core
competency. There we go that was a
tongue twister is design marketing and
ecosystem management. Um it's going to
want to deploy its capital on R&D and
brand building not on $50 billion
factories um that are going to be
obsolete. That is Foxcon's risk. Foxcon
is managing the risk. um and creating a
a partition there. Now, it would the
thing the thing is if Foxcon only
produced iPhones, then that would not be
rational. Then it's like, okay, well,
Foxcon is just going to pass the costs
of that of managing that risk on to
Apple. So, Apple might as well absorb
Foxcon, but Foxcon produces uh goods for
many companies. and then rapid retooling
that flexibility by by distributing the
risk across multiple big clients and
also reusing that capital that they have
because here's the thing if Apple owned
its own factories then those factories
would just do one thing and they would
need to retool which means that they're
they're actually not able to benefit
from the economies of scale. Um, here's
an example. iPhone sales versus
PlayStation sales, um, or Microsoft
servers or Google Pixel phones or
Samsung phones. By being able to
manufacture all of those, they're able
to reuse not only their physical capital
um, internally, but also their logistics
lines because guess what? iPhones and
PlayStations and Google Google phones
and Samsung phones, they're all more or
less being sold in the same markets. So
that is where the efficiency comes from.
So this is where you see like okay you
can you can now now that you have a
model for this this is going to be the
same thing as like TSMC or AWS uh scaled
out more broadly. So TSMC produces the
chips for Apple, Nvidia uh or rather
they they provide they provide chips
that are used everywhere. That's what
I'm trying to say. They provide chips
that are used everywhere. though it
doesn't make sense for any of them to to
make their own chips end to end. See
what I mean? Likewise, AWS rather than
build their own servers and their own
GPUs, what they're primarily doing is
offering inference. They're offering
data. They're offering uh the actual
compute. So, you can say that they're
compute as a service or what we would
just call cloud services today. Um for
them, they just want the servers as
cheaply as possible. They want the hard
drives as cheaply as possible. They want
the networks as cheaply as possible. So
even though they are a prime consumer of
networking equipment and and data center
equipment and even data centers, um it
makes them it makes sense for them to
own the data center but then to stuff it
with gear that is built by other people.
So that has been a lesson in the post
labor enterprise. I hope this makes
sense to you and thank you for listening
to the very end. Um yeah, stay tuned for
more and we will keep talking. Cheers.
