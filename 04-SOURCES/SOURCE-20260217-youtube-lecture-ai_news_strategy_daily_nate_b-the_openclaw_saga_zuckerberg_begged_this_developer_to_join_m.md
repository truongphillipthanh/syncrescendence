_______________________________________
What's really happening when the creator of the fastest-growing open source project in GitHub history joins OpenAI? The common story is that this is an acqui-hire—but the reality is more complicated when both Zuck and Sam competed personally for a developer bleeding $20,000 a month.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why Peter Steinberger's move signals where the entire industry is headed in 2026:

 • Why OpenClaw's 200,000 GitHub stars emerged from project number 44 after a nine-figure exit
 • How the Chrome-Chromium model shapes what happens to the open source community
 • What 40+ security patches shipped days before the announcement reveals about operational knowledge
 • Where the shift from chatbots to personal agents that manage real computers actually lands

For developers and builders watching the agent platform layer take shape, the question is no longer whether delegation becomes the new interface paradigm—it's who owns the foundation underneath it.
