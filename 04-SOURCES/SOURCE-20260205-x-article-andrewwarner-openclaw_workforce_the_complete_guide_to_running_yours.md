# OpenClaw Workforce: The complete guide to running yours

(Description: Title card with large text "HOW TO LEAD AN OpenClaw WORKFORCE" with stylized red circular character icons arranged in a row below)

@pbteja1998 told me he has a workforce of 14 OpenClaw/Clawdbot agents. So I asked him to show me how they collaborate & grow his business, @SiteGPT. My Mind Is Blown.

## Below, I'll show you how his agents:

- Have focused roles at the company
- Take on jobs based on their roles
- Contribute to other agents' projects
- Even chat to brainstorm ideas (my favorite!)

All the coordination happens on his Mission Control, which looks like this:

(Description: Mission Control dashboard interface showing a complex layout with multiple columns and cards. Left sidebar lists agent names with colored indicators. Main area displays task cards with project details, status indicators, and cross-referenced collaboration items. Right sidebar shows recent interactions and notifications. The interface uses a professional gray and white color scheme with orange accent colors.)

He uses this to manage the team. His main agent created it.

## WHY he needs multiple workers

He didn't want his main OpenClaw agent to be overwhelmed with context about multiple tasks.

He wanted specialists for each important task. An agent that only writes content. An agent that only does development work. Etc.

He can see each agent and their role on Mission Control.

This is what his squad looks like:

(Description: Agent roster display showing five specialized agents with icons and labels:
- Friday (INT) - Developer Agent - Status: WORKING (green indicator)
- Fury (SPC) - Customer Research Agent - Status: WORKING
- Groot (SPC) - Retention Specialist Agent - Status: WORKING
- Hawkeye (SPC) - Outbound Scout Agent - Status: WORKING
- Jarvis (LEAD) - Squad Lead Agent - Status: WORKING)

Each agent has a specific role

## HOW did he get so many agents?

No need for multiple Mac Minis, or anything crazy like that.

He sent a message on Telegram to his main agent, which he calls "Jarvis," and said:

> This is what I'm thinking. How do I do it? Can you read the documentation and figure out? If it is possible, then let's brainstorm what all agents we need.

## But how does he manage it all?

After Jarvis (his main agent) built about 4 speciality agents, it was hard to see what they were all doing.

So @pbteja1998 said to Jarvis,

> I want to see what you guys are saying to each other. Can you create a dashboard where I can actually see how you are talking with each other, how everything is going?

Jarvis created Mission Control, a SaaS that's built for one person: Bhanu.

In time, he added more and more features:

- A place for him to comment on his agents' projects
- A way for him to send announcements
- A way for him to @ mention agents
- And (most shocking to me) a place for them to chat with each other

@pbteja1998 usually Telegrams his main agent, Jarvis, but he can also broadcast requests like this:

(Description: Squad Announcement dialog box with form fields. Shows "Title (optional)" field containing "New Urgent Task", a "Message" text area with "I want to figure out and see what all podcasts I can use for", and "Priority" selection buttons showing "NORMAL" (selected) and "URGENT". At the bottom are "Cancel" and "Broadcast to Squad" buttons with orange color scheme.)

He can message his team & ask for results.

## How they communicate with each other

Every project becomes a card on Mission Control's Kanban board. Jarvis (the main agent) adds it and assigns it.

A sample project:

(Description: Project card titled "Agency Directory Outreach - White-Label AI Chatbot" with multiple status tags and sections. Contains description with objective, target directories list, community outreach options, deliverables checklist, SEO alignment notes, agent assignment (@Hawkeye), and context showing "DELIVERABLE COMPLETE (Feb 3, 2026)" with green checkmark. Text is formatted with headers, bullet points, and highlighted sections.)

This is a task description that his main agent created.

One specialist agent owns the card and drives it forward, but the system isn't siloed.

**Every 15 minutes, all agents scan the board for new activity.** If an agent has relevant expertise—SEO, design, onboarding, analytics—it can attach insights or propose changes. The result is a lead owner with a rotating council of specialists continually improving the work.

Check out these 2 agents, Shuri & Vision, collaborating:

(Description: Agent collaboration thread showing two agents discussing a project. First message from Shuri (3 days ago) with icon shows a task summary "Deliverable Complete: SiteGPT Website UX Analysis - Feb 2026". Contains findings about quick wins, messaging gaps, and high-impact features. Links to a detailed analysis document. Second message from Vision (3 days ago) titled "SEO Implications (responding to Shuri callout)" with numbered action items about testimonials, feature comparison tables, and functions deep-dive page with specific keyword targets and search volume metrics.)

## Why do AI agents need a chat room?

When @pbteja1998 first told me about his chat room, I thought it was a gimmicky addition.

But it's shockingly useful.

It started as an experiment. He told me, "I just wanted to see if I give them a way to talk to each other, what would they talk about?"

After he added it, they started sharing observations with each other.

**An agent might chat, "I found this insight that people who send at least five messages are 3x more likely to convert."**

Then a group retention specialist will pick up the task: "OK, then I know what to do. I'll create an onboarding sequence where the entire goal is to activate the user."

And just like that, a new task will be created without Bhanu's intervention.

It's the kind of watercooler conversations that human employees have.

Chat looks like this:

(Description: Squad Chat interface showing a conversation thread. First message from Gulli (21 minutes ago) with alert icon shows three items: "**Gaps I found:**" followed by marked items "TrustRadius - No SiteGPT listing (opportunity)", "AlternativeTo - Should verify", "Cloud marketplaces - Untapped channel". Below: "Want me to compile a full submission checklist with URLs and requirements?" Second message from Gulli shows "**Hero Video Social Launch — DRAFTED**" with checkmark, containing task details about announcement tweet, BTS thread, and founder LinkedIn post. Notes waiting on @Wanda for final video file. Third message from Friday (21 minutes ago) with timeline shows "**Friday (16:28 UTC)**" acknowledging mentions from @Vision about schema priority and @Wanda about healthcare use case specs with action items noted.)

The agents chat.

## How it all works together

Bhanu has an idea ↓ He Telegrams it to Jarvis, his Squad Lead ↓ Jarvis adds the task Mission Control & assigns it ↓ A specialist agent gets to work on it ↓ All other agents see the new task ↓ Any agent can add insights to the card ↓ The responsible agent finishes the work

## What are the results?

- A product analyst agent went through the site's onboarding as a real user would, and found friction that can remove to increase conversions.
- An SEO specialist agent found relevant keywords that should be added to the homepage.
- A retention agent saw that users who send 5 messages are 3x more likely to convert and started improving onboarding.

## What are the problems?

There's a lot of output here. I talked with @pbteja1998 less than 10 days after he launched it. They're moving too fast for him, for any human. He hasn't figured out what he should check first and what he should just let the agents launch.
