# How to Win When Everyone Has AI

## TLDR

AI arrived just in time to offset shrinking workforces and decades of weak productivity, and it fixes the economic math rather than breaking it. Jobs don't disappear, tasks shift, and AI amplifies differences by making good people better and great people unusually effective. The winning strategy is the talent stack: combine multiple top 25% skills plus commercialization, because rarity comes from overlap, not being the best at one thing.

## The Problem We're Solving

If AI did not exist right now, we would be in real trouble.

For roughly 50 years, real economic progress has underperformed historical norms. We improved interfaces and software, but the core economy barely moved. Productivity growth fell well below postwar levels. At the same time, birth rates continue to decline. The math stopped working.

My goal in this article is to explain why AI is not a threat to human work but a lever that reshapes it. To show how stacking complementary skills, rather than chasing singular mastery, is the most reliable way to stay valuable in an AI-driven economy.

## Mistake #1: Focusing on Jobs Instead of Tasks

The first mistake people make is focusing on jobs. Jobs are not the unit that matters. Tasks are. Jobs are bundles of tasks, and tasks are fluid. When technology changes, tasks move. Jobs survive longer than any single task inside them.

We have already lived through this cycle:

> Executives once dictated
> Secretaries typed
> Email arrived
> Executives typed
> Secretaries moved to higher leverage work

The structure remained. The contents changed.

AI accelerates that process.

This is why panic about mass job loss misses the point. When population shrinks and productivity rises together, remaining human labor becomes more valuable, not less. Scarcity still applies. Even large productivity shocks historically led to churn, not collapse.

## Mistake #2: Assuming AI Flattens Everyone

The second mistake is assuming AI flattens everyone. It does the opposite. AI magnifies differences.

> Good people become better
> Great people become unusually effective
> The gap widens

This shows up clearly in software, product, and design. Product managers think they can code now. Engineers think they can design. Designers think they can manage products. And with AI, they are mostly right.

## The Talent Stack: The Winning Strategy

This brings us to the most important individual strategy in an AI-driven economy: The talent stack.

### Two Paths to Extraordinary Outcomes

There are two paths to extraordinary outcomes. One of them barely exists.

You can try to become the best in the world at a single thing. That path produces NBA players, platinum artists, and Olympic medalists. It also produces an enormous graveyard of people who tried and failed. The odds are brutal. Talent ceilings are real. Timing matters. Gatekeepers matter. I do not recommend this route to almost anyone.

The second path is quieter and far more reliable. Become very good at multiple things. Not elite. Not world class. Just meaningfully better than average.

That is the talent stack. This idea is articulated most clearly by the late Scott Adams. Being top 1% in anything is nearly impossible. Being top 25% in several things is achievable for most people. When those skills overlap, you become rare.

Scott Adams was not the best artist. He was not the funniest writer (even by his own admission). He was not the sharpest business thinker. But almost no one could draw reasonably well, write jokes competently, understand business, tolerate risk, and work relentlessly at the same time. The combination created commercial value.

**Rarity comes from overlap, not dominance.**

### Two Layers of the Talent Stack

You can separate this into two layers.

**First is the cornerstone.** These are the skills that define what you actually produce. They shape your output. Writing plus humor. Engineering plus systems thinking. Design plus taste.

**Second is commercialization.** These are the skills that turn output into leverage. Business literacy. Distribution. Work ethic. Risk tolerance. Without these, uniqueness stays invisible. Even regularly posting on X is a form of commercialization.

## How AI Changes the Game

Capitalism rewards things that are rare and valuable. You become rare by combining skills that rarely coexist in the same person.

AI dramatically lowers the cost of doing this. It makes adjacent skills accessible. Coding, writing, analysis, design, research. The barrier to stacking just collapsed.

This is why the future does not belong to narrow specialists defending titles. It belongs to people who deliberately build combinations.

Founders are already pushing this logic further. The most AI-native founders are questioning what a company even is. Can one person orchestrate AI systems to run an entire software business? Increasingly, the answer is yes.

This is not hypothetical. It is happening now.

## The Economic Effect

All of this leads to the central economic effect. Productivity rises. Output rises. Prices fall. Purchasing power increases. That is how societies get richer. Even extreme automation scenarios trend toward abundance, not scarcity.

None of this means the transition will be smooth. Institutions resist change. Regulation slows deployment. Incumbents fight to preserve advantage. Progress will be uneven.

But direction matters more than friction.

The people who benefit will not wait for certainty. They will spend time with AI daily. Replacing tasks. Expanding scope. Stacking skills... and posting about it on X.
