# Agent Skills Benchmark Thread
Agent Skills are everywhere - Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex all support them. But do they actually work?
105 domain experts from Stanford, CMU, Berkeley, Oxford, Amazon, ByteDance & more built SkillsBench to find that out.
86 tasks. 11 domains. 7,308 trajectories. 🧵👇
(Description: A comprehensive visualization infographic titled "SkillsBench" showing:
**Main Title**: SkillsBench - A benchmark of 86 verifiable, expert-created tasks measuring how reusable skills improve AI coding agents across 11 professional domains.
**Quality Labels**: ✓ Verifiable | ✓ Human-Created | ✓ Expert-Verified | ✓ Real Data (not synthetic) | ✓ Tasks Humans Get Paid to Do
**Skills Layer Architecture Diagram**: A circular three-layer diagram showing:
- Outermost ring: Skills (Applications, Workflows)
- Middle ring: Agent Harness Layer (Operating Systems)
- Center: Models Layer (CPUs)
Text explanation: "Skills Layer - Contain specific details, workflows that extend agent functionality to particular applications" and "Agent Harness Layer - Coordinates agents, manages tool access, and handles I/O. Analogous to an operating system that mediates between applications and hardware. Models Layer - The foundational AI models that power reasoning and generation. Like CPUs, they provide the raw computational capability but upper layers build upon it."
**86 Expert-Level Tasks Across 11 Domains**:
- Office & White Collar: Email, Word, PowerPoint, PDF, Gmail
- Natural Science: Physics, Astronomy, Chemistry, Life Sciences
- Finance: Macroeconomics, Economics, Portfolio Mgmt
- Healthcare: Clinical Lab, Cancer Diagnosis
- Manufacturing: Hardware, Equipment, Job Planning
- Cybersecurity: CVE Analysis, CVSS Scoring
- Energy: Solar, Grid, Optimum Power
- Mathematics: Discrete Math, Coding
- Robotics: PDDL Planning, Control Systems
- Media & Content: Video Editing, Audio, Building, LLMs
- Software Eng.: ML Repos, DevOps, Bug Fix, Migration
**Difficulty Levels**: Extended 50% | Extreme 30%
**Community Momentum**: 800+ Community Members | 180+ Contributors | 80%+ PhDs or Senior Professionals
**Agent Performance - All Conditions Chart** (Comparative bar chart showing performance metrics):
1. Gemini CLI Flash: 25.3% performance
2. Claude Code Opus 4.5: 29.9% performance
3. Codex GPT-5.2: 20.3% performance
4. Claude Code Opus 4.8: 20.0% performance
5. Gemini CLI Pro: 18.8% performance
6. Claude Code Sonnet 4.5: 17.5% performance
7. Claude Code Haiku 4.5: 18.8% performance
**Skills Substitute for Model Scale** (Line graph showing trajectory):
Line showing relationship between model scale (x-axis: Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.5, Opus 4.8) and performance metrics with and without skills enabled, demonstrating how skills can substitute for increased model scale.)
