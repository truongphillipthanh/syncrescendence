## Description (no transcript available)

The White House pauses a proposed AI executive order after Republican pushback highlights a battle over federal preemption of state AI rules and an emerging political shift ahead of the midterms. Insurers are seeking to exclude AI risk amid growing litigation and fears about opaque large language models producing systemic, correlated losses. Tech firms are racing to scale AI compute and talent, with Google planning major infrastructure buildouts, OpenAI poaching Apple hardware engineers, and enterprise startups like Sierra scaling rapidly.
