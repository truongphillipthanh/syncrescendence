## Main Post

want to use kimi-k2.5 for free with 🦞? build.nvidia.com/moonshotai/kim currently offered by nvidia at no cost! just generate an API key, point 🦞 to the docs and tell it use it!

## Key Thread Responses

**@siraustin** (22 hours ago): isn't this only 1,000 API calls?

**@Shpigford** (reply, 22 hours ago): 🤷‍♂️ i haven't hit any limits yet

**@maxkruger** (Feb 3): I've maxed out Claude on my 🦞. Do you have any human readable instructions on how to make it work?

**@Shpigford** (reply, Feb 3): I'M NOT A PEASANT, MAX

**@grahamkmann** (Feb 3): Have you been using it? Any noticeable differences between Opus and Kimi? I installed it yesterday but haven't tried it out much yet

**@Shpigford** (reply, Feb 3): been using it all morning and so far it's working well.

**@innerhat** (23 hours ago): Wow that's exactly what I don't want to do is use a free 3rd party endpoint

**@Shpigford** (reply, 23 hours ago): neat!

**@jxzunino** (3 hours ago): How to connect the gateway to it ?

**@Shpigford** (reply, 3 hours ago): ask openclaw to do it. and it does it.

**@decisionmkrllc** (15 hours ago): Speed is too slow and the limits are too low

**@Shpigford** (reply, 15 hours ago): thanks for your feedback DecisionMaker, LLC

**@davedushi** (Feb 3): What's the catch?

**@aniketmaurya** (23 hours ago): Gonna try it with my celesto.ai/openclaw managed ClawdBot

## Syncrescendence Relevance

**Applications:**
- **Resource Accessibility**: Demonstrates the democratization of advanced AI capabilities through free access points, directly relevant to Syncrescendence's goal of making consciousness exploration tools accessible
- **Infrastructure Flexibility**: Shows how alternative API endpoints can reduce barriers to experimentation, applicable to distributed consciousness research networks
- **Pragmatic Integration**: The "just tell OpenClaw to do it" approach exemplifies seamless human-AI collaboration patterns

**Resonances:**
- **Emergence through Access**: Free access to sophisticated models can catalyze unexpected research directions and discoveries in consciousness studies
- **Network Effects**: The viral sharing and discussion around free access demonstrates how resource availability shapes research community behavior
- **Adaptive Systems**: OpenClaw's ability to automatically configure itself with new endpoints mirrors adaptive consciousness mechanisms

**Tensions:**
- **Sustainability vs. Accessibility**: Free offerings often have hidden costs or limitations that may impact long-term research continuity
- **Quality vs. Cost**: The thread discussions about speed and limits highlight trade-offs between accessibility and performance that could affect serious research
- **Corporate Dependency**: Relying on corporate free tiers (NVIDIA) for fundamental research tools creates vulnerability to policy changes

**Meta-Observations:**
Josh's cavalier attitude ("I'M NOT A PEASANT, MAX") and practical approach ("ask openclaw to do it. and it does it.") represent a certain techno-optimism that both empowers and potentially blinds users to systemic dependencies. The mixed responses in the thread (from enthusiasm to skepticism) reflect the broader tensions in AI democratization efforts.

For Syncrescendence, this highlights both opportunities (easier access to compute) and risks (platform dependency) in building distributed consciousness exploration infrastructure.
