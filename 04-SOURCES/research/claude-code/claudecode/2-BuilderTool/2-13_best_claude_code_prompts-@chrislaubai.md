1. The "Contradictions Finder"

Perfect for papers, reports, or long docs.

"List all internal contradictions, unresolved tensions, or claims that don't fully follow from the evidence."

It catches things humans gloss over.

2. The "Reviewer #2" prompt

Yes, that reviewer.

"Critique this like a skeptical peer reviewer.
Be harsh. Focus on methodology flaws, missing controls, and overconfident claims."

Brutal. Necessary.

3. The "Turn This Into a Paper" prompt

Use this when you dump raw notes, links, or half-baked ideas.

"Turn the following material into a structured research brief. Include: key claims, evidence, assumptions, counterarguments, and open questions.
Flag anything weak or missing."

This alone replaces hours of cleanup.

4. The "Reviewer #2" prompt

Yes, that reviewer.

"Critique this like a skeptical peer reviewer.
Be harsh. Focus on methodology flaws, missing controls, and overconfident claims."

5. The "Explain It Backwards" trick

Great for checking real understanding.

"Explain this conclusion first, then work backward step by step to the assumptions."

If the logic collapses, you'll see it immediately.

6. The "Compare Like a Scientist" prompt

Not feature lists. Real comparisons.

"Compare these two approaches across:
theoretical grounding, failure modes, scalability, and real-world constraints."

7. The "What Would Break This?" prompt

Gold for forecasting.

"Describe scenarios where this approach fails catastrophically.
Not edge cases. Realistic failure modes."


8. The "What Changed My Mind?" closer

"After analyzing all of this, what should change my current belief?"

This is how real researchers think.

9. The "One-Page Mental Model"

"Compress this entire topic into a single mental model I can remember."

If it can't compress, you don't own it yet.

10. The "Translate Across Domains" prompt

"Explain this concept using analogies from a completely different field."

This unlocks insight, not just understanding.

11. The "Steal the Structure" trick

This is underrated.

"Ignore the content.
Analyze the structure, flow, and argument pattern.
Why does this work so well?"

Use it on great papers and essays.

12. The "Compare Like a Scientist" prompt

Not feature lists. Real comparisons.

"Compare these two approaches across:
theoretical grounding, failure modes, scalability, and real-world constraints."

13. The "Assumption Stress Test"

This one comes straight from research forums.

"List every assumption this argument relies on.
Now tell me which ones are most fragile and why."
