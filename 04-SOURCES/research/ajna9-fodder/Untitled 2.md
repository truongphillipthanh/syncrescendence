Perfect, now conduct a process archaeology + Kaizen. 

I'm attaching the series of questioning I did to elicit this final coalescence of the definitive Claude Code guide.

It is important to note that I painstakingly manually transcribed a compilation of user implementation, mostly on X (some were based enough to aggregate resources, much of 1st party documentation included.) verbatim.

I felt that it was important to preserve primary sources. 

It's also important to note which each platform contributed in their Deep Researches when given the same prompt. Although it was a chorus, leaning into each's comparative advantage, it may perhaps could have been more efficient or efficacious as a medley. This is actually when Grok ↔︎ X really comes in handy. Perhaps we ought to consider upgrading Perplexity, especially to scour the forums (who is allowed access to Reddit?) What about Manus?

Furthermore, it’s abundantly clear that Claude’s Web app is the premier destination for (manual) synthesis, because it can support such denser reports in the Project Files. However we should figure out how to leverage NotebookLM, and perhaps Gemini in Google AI Studio. The web app can’t support the token limits.

To hammer home, we want to comprehensively, meticulously, and rigorously elucidate this procedure and formalize it.

It is essentially a 'building upon previous research' process, (which we conducted via chorus.) We take what has been working for people, adopt it, and build upon it.
