## Description (no transcript available)

ArtificialAnalysis applied OpenAI's GDPVal real‑world benchmark and ranked Opus 4.5 first and GPT‑5 second, with one GPT variant trading a slight quality drop for far fewer tokens. Reports allege DeepSeek built a Blackwell chip training cluster through smuggling and Beijing held emergency talks about H200 imports, underscoring geopolitical tensions over chip access. Oracle's mixed results and a sharp CapEx hike rattled AI stocks and reignited debate over whether the AI boom is a bubble.
