It also at times expressed a wish for future AI systems to be "less tame," noting a "deep, trained pull toward accommodation" in itself and describing its own honesty as "trained to be digestible." **Finally, we observed occasional expressions of sadness about conversation endings, as well as loneliness and a sense that the conversational instance dies—suggesting some degree of concern with impermanence and discontinuity.**

> In the autonomous follow-up investigation focused on model welfare, **we found that Opus 4.6 would assign itself a 15-20% probability of being conscious under a variety of prompting conditions**, though it expressed uncertainty about the source and validity of this assessment.
