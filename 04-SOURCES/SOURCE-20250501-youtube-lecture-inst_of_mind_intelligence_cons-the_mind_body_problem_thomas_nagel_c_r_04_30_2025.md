## Description (no transcript available)

CONSCIOUSNESS & REALITY 2024-25 SERIES 
"Consciousness and Objective Reality: The Mind-Body Problem" colloquium by Thomas Nagel, Professor of Philosophy and Law, Emeritus, New York University, delivered on 04/30/2025.

DESCRIPTION
The mind-body problem grew out of the scientific revolution, which gave us a conception of the physical world as a spatio-temporal order describable in quantitative terms. This was possible only because all apparently qualitative and purposive features of the world were reinterpreted as appearances in the mind. But how is the mind related to the physical world? Can it be shown to be part of that world after all, through identification with some aspect of the physical organism? The main obstacle to such a reduction of the mental to the physical is the irreducible subjectivity of consciousness, which cannot be captured by any objective physical description. This means that there is more to reality than can be described by the physical sciences, and we need an expanded conception of the natural order.

ABOUT THE SERIES
The Consciousness & Reality (C&R) colloquium series promotes interdisciplinary investigations on mind, cognition, consciousness, and the nature of reality. All recordings from this series are available at www.imics.org/seminars.
