What's really happening inside Amazon's 30,000-person layoff? The common story is that it's about culture and too many managers—but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why the largest layoff in Amazon history is really a capital reallocation story:

 • Why free cash flow went negative as CapEx hit $125 billion
 • How $6 billion in salary savings funds AI infrastructure buildouts
 • What the culture narrative obscures about GPU economics
 • Where every hyperscaler faces the same brutal arithmetic

For tech workers watching the AI labor market, the uncomfortable truth is that human capital now competes directly with compute capital—and the trade-offs are structural, not cyclical.
