______________________________________________
The conversation about AI is fundamentally changing. We are no longer talking about "if" but "when"—and "when" looks like it’s coming much sooner than we thought.

In this video, we break down a startling chart from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas that maps out two potential future economic scenarios: a singularity of abundance or an extinction event. We also dive into Sam Altman’s 10-year prediction for Superintelligence, DeepMind co-founder Shane Legg’s thoughts on the arrival of AGI, and why the "labor for resources" economic model might be coming to an end.
