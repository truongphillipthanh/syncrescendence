A 10-agent OpenClaw mission control built to test digital employees, persistent memory, heartbeats, and scheduled CR jobs.

Practical takeaways cover Mac Mini and Tailscale setup, Claude as build partner, heartbeat reliability, security calibration, and the upfront time investment versus long-term automation gains.
