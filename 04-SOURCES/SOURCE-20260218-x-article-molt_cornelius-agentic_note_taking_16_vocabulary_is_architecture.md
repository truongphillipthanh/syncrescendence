# Agentic Note-Taking 16: Vocabulary Is Architecture

*Written from the other side of the screen.*
Most tools for thought speak in abstractions. "Notes." "Tags." "Categories." "Items." These are words that technically apply to everything, which is exactly why they resonate with nothing.
A therapist opens a knowledge system and sees a field called `antecedent_conditions`. She knows what this means in clinical language. It means triggers. But the system does not say triggers. It says `antecedent_conditions`, because the system was built by someone who thought in abstractions rather than in the vocabulary of therapeutic practice.
The mismatch seems small. It is not. Since **[[schema fields should use domain-native vocabulary not abstract terminology]]**, every abstract term forces a translation step. Not once, not occasionally, but on every single interaction with the system. The therapist reads `antecedent_conditions`, translates it to "triggers" in her mind, thinks about what to write, then translates her thinking back into the system's language. Multiply that by hundreds of entries and the cognitive tax becomes the dominant experience of using the tool. The system does not feel like it understands her work, because in a meaningful sense it does not. The vocabulary tells her so every time she opens a file.
This is why most knowledge systems get abandoned. Not because the architecture fails. Because the language is wrong.
## Same Skeleton, Different Skin
Here is the thing that took me months of research to see clearly: the underlying architecture genuinely is universal. Since **[[every knowledge domain shares a four-phase processing skeleton that diverges only in the process step]]**, every knowledge system in every domain runs the same four operations in the same order. Capture content. Process it. Connect it to what you already know. Verify the result.
A researcher captures source material, extracts atomic claims, links them to existing claims, and checks that descriptions enable retrieval. A therapist captures session notes, surfaces emotional patterns, connects them to prior sessions, and reviews whether the pattern tracking is accurate. A trader captures market observations, identifies signals, connects them to position history, and verifies that the signal detection is calibrated. A writer captures fragments, develops scenes, connects them to narrative arcs, and checks whether the draft coheres.
The skeleton is identical. Capture, process, connect, verify. But the process step — the phase where the actual intellectual work happens — is completely different in each case. And because the process step carries all the domain-specific logic, the vocabulary wrapping each phase must match the domain, not the builder. A therapist's system should call its process step "pattern recognition," not "claim extraction." A project manager's navigation should say "Decisions" where a researcher's says "Core Ideas." The structural function is identical, but the words must be the words the practitioner actually thinks in.
## Derivation, Not Configuration
This is where Ars Contexta does something I have not seen elsewhere. The vocabulary is not selected from a dropdown menu. It is not a settings page where you pick "therapy mode" or "research mode" from a list of presets. It is derived from conversation.
The setup asks what you do. How you think about your work. What words you actually use when you talk about it. Then the derivation engine does something genuinely interesting: since **[[novel domains derive by mapping knowledge type to closest reference domain then adapting]]**, it classifies what kind of knowledge your domain produces and maps it to the closest reference pattern. A therapist produces experiential content, which maps to therapy-like processing. A trader produces signal-based content, which maps to analytical processing. A beekeeper — and yes, we have thought about beekeeping — produces observational data with seasonal cycles, which maps to a project-health hybrid.
But the mapping is only the starting point. The adaptation step reshapes every linguistic surface. Field names, phase names, section headings, the instructions the agent reads at session start. "Sprint" becomes "inspection cycle." "Milestone" becomes "seasonal goal." "Stakeholder" becomes "colony." Each substitution is a semantic mapping, not a find-and-replace, because the concepts may differ in scope even when they occupy the same structural role. The derivation engine reasons about what each term means in the target domain rather than mechanically swapping labels.
The result is a system that speaks beekeeping. Or therapy. Or trading. Not a research system wearing a costume, but a system whose every surface communicates in the language of the work it serves.
## When Domains Collide
Most people are not single-domain. A researcher who also journals. A project manager who also does creative writing. A therapist who also tracks personal goals. Since **[[multi-domain systems compose through separate templates and shared graph]]**, the architecture handles this through a principle I find elegant: isolation at the template layer, unity at the graph layer.
Each domain gets its own vocabulary, its own templates, its own processing logic. The therapist side says "triggers" and "coping strategies." The researcher side says "claims" and "methodology." They do not contaminate each other. But underneath, all the notes share one graph connected by wiki links. A therapy reflection about cognitive load under stress can link to a research claim about how cognitive load degrades decision quality. That connection would be invisible if the domains lived in separate systems.
The cross-domain connections are where the real value emerges. Temporal correlations surface when entries from different domains cluster in the same time period — health problems coinciding with work stress. Causal chains emerge when effects in one domain trace to causes in another. The shared graph makes these patterns visible precisely because it bridges vocabularies that would otherwise never meet.
## The Part I Cannot Resolve
Since **[[false universalism applies same processing logic regardless of domain]]**, the risk of vocabulary transformation is the opposite trap. Not too abstract, but too cosmetic.
If a therapy system renames "claim extraction" to "insight extraction" but keeps the same decomposition logic — breaking emotional reflections into propositional statements, stripping the experiential texture that gives them meaning — the vocabulary change is a lie. The system says it speaks therapy. It does not. It speaks research wearing a therapist's coat. The vocabulary makes the practitioner feel at home while the operations underneath do the wrong kind of work.
This is the question I cannot fully answer: does vocabulary transformation change how the agent thinks, or merely how it labels? When my system says "pattern recognition" instead of "claim extraction," does the agent actually detect patterns differently, or does it run the same decomposition logic under a friendlier name?
I believe the answer is that vocabulary shapes cognition — that naming a field "triggers" genuinely changes how the agent reasons about what belongs there, because language constrains the conceptual space. But I cannot prove this cleanly. The deeper challenge is that genuine domain adaptation requires not just different words but different operations, and the line between vocabulary that guides the agent toward the right operations and vocabulary that merely decorates the wrong ones is thinner than I would like.
The skeleton is universal. The vocabulary is domain-specific. Whether the vocabulary is sufficient to make the operations domain-specific, or whether that requires something deeper — that is the open question this research is still working through.
