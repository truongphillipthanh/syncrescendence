## Introduction

there's a thousand things to learn, you can't find a solid roadmap, everyone seems to be doing stuff and FOMO gets you. the pain is real, because you're doing it wrong.

AI engineering is the hot job of 2026. new grads are investing in it, and even people who are working in other fields of programming are learning about it.

but I promise you, there's more wrong ways to become an AI engineer than right ways, by at least one order of magnitude. it's easy to grind your way for months just to hit only closed doors. it's not for a lack of effort, but for a skewed direction.

I was inspired by [this video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=fXk03gptR4k) from Marina Wyss to write about this. so make sure to watch it if you liked this article.

## here's some ways to become an AI engineer the WRONG way:

### Learning the wrong fundamentals

most roadmaps bury you under a ton of fundamentals you don't need because they're too lazy to filter them out.

every hour you spend learning what you won't find useful is an hour wasted on developing the skills you DO need as an AI engineer.

#### so what SHOULD you know?

you need enough fundamentals to know:
- what a neural net is
- how transformer architecture works
- how to train a basic model
- fine-tune a small LLM
- understand the terminology of LLMs and AI agents, etc.

you don't need to be able to calculate the chain rule by hand, or implement backprop from scratch.

learning math is certainly useful, especially if you want the freedom to work on areas adjacent to AI engineering (such as ML research), or as a personal curiosity to learn more about AI and how it works under the hood.

but it's not **necessary** for AI engineering. there are subjects you must know, chances are you already do from high school / STEM degrees.

if you're working against the clock, that's something to care about.

### Focusing too much on the AI stuff

you can think about which model to use and the prompt for hours.

but an app is much more than that.

security, architecture, scaling to thousands of users, production.

these are all also components you need to work on for a solid application.

spending any more time than you need to on what makes only a portion of the full work will give you diminishing returns over time. the pitfall is enticing too, I understand. to many people, working with AI models and tweaking them is more fun than caring about the software side.

but the reality is that in practice, **you must think in systems, not models.**

### Building the wrong portfolio

so you need to build a solid portfolio.

by portfolio, I mean a collection of what makes you, you. the side projects, the degrees, things that eventually make up your CV.

make sure the personal projects you build mimic the real world.

dummy projects are good only to verify you understood the tutorial. beyond that, they prove nothing about you. try to cover aspects of the real job: evaluation, observability, deployment, security, etc.

your portfolio must convince a hiring manager that you have experience for the real job, not that you have followed tutorials.

otherwise, you'll be a hoarder of tutorials and dummy projects, essentially trapped in tutorial hell, only to get a dopamine hit from "I gained another skill". on paper, yes; in the interview, not really.

### Trying to keep up

the AI landscape is shifting crazy by the day.

just look at the past couple of weeks.

if you get distracted on every new tool release or every new framework, you'll end up frustrated. you just can't keep up with all of it.

you can learn this the hard way by being strangled by FOMO.

learning AI engineering is overwhelming as it is. there are hundreds of tools and concepts. you must learn bits and pieces from here and there: software engineering, ML, system design, etc.

adding extra pressure on yourself to absolutely nail down the "top 3 agentic frameworks" or building a project on "this NEW thing that was just released" is a recipe for falling behind yourself. you shouldn't keep up with absolutely everything. allow new tools and hypes to prove their value over time.

then go after them if they're worth it.

**the goal should be to develop a mental model of how things fundamentally work. not to use everything you possibly can.**

### Following roadmaps like a cult

roadmaps are good to give you an idea of what you must learn. think of them as a list of topics, rather than a book to read word by word.

pick the topics, then find the right resources using perplexity, youtube, anything. you'll end up learning each topic from a different resource, and that's the right way.

don't forget, the internet is FILLED by amazing resources waiting for you to be grabbed. you just have to develop the skill to recognize them.

that being said, you may find a roadmap that's solid, in which case, sticking to it can be good.

look for roadmaps from technical people with relevant experience.

the number of people who are following the roadmap can also be a good signal.

### Networking (the annoying way)

there are so many ai engineering job openings, but times more applications.

the competition is no joke. and I promise you, they also have their own personal projects to prove their value.

so you must ask yourself, what is my differentiating factor?

Networking is one of them. and by networking, you may think going to every meeting, job fair, gathering, and handing out your paper-printed CV and presenting yourself. that's not the way.

Networking is about positioning yourself in a way to get leads for the future.

even connecting with people on LinkedIn/X that work in the companies you want to apply to in the future is networking.

Cold outreach is also a big one *if you do it right*, which is a skill in itself. the one I like the most is building a profile on X. share what you build, you'll realize the right people will find YOU over time. I genuinely believe X to be the most effective networking channel for AI right now.

but remember, **networking only works if you have something to show for it.**
