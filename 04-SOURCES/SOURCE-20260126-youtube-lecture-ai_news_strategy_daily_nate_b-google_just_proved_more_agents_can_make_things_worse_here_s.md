________________________
What's really happening with multi-agent AI systems? The common story is that more agents means more capability — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why the frameworks get multi-agent architecture wrong:

 • Why adding agents can actually make systems perform worse
 • How serial dependencies block the conversion of compute into capability
 • What Cursor and Yegge independently discovered about coordination collapse
 • Why complexity should live in orchestration, not in agents

Google and MIT found that once single-agent accuracy exceeds 45%, adding more agents yields diminishing or negative returns. The team dynamics metaphor imports human coordination problems we've struggled with for centuries. The architectures that actually scale look almost too simple — two tiers, ignorant workers, no shared state, and planned endings.

For builders deploying agents at scale, the investment should go into orchestration systems — not into making individual agents smarter.

Chapters
00:00 The pitch for multi-agent systems is seductive but wrong
02:17 Core insight: simplicity scales, complexity creates serial dependencies
04:31 Google MIT study: more agents can mean worse outcomes
06:50 Rule 1: Two tiers, not teams
09:16 The team dynamics metaphor imports human coordination problems
11:34 Rule 2: Workers stay ignorant of the big picture
12:57 Rule 3: No shared state between workers
15:15 Rule 4: Plan for endings, not continuous operation
17:35 Yegge's Gastown universal propulsion principle
19:21 Rule 5: Prompts matter more than coordination infrastructure
21:42 Complexity lives in orchestration, not in agents
23:00 Why 10,000 dumb agents beats one brilliant agent
