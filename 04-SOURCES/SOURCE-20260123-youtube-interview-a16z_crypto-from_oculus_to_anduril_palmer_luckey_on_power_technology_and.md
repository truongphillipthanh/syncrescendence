## Description (no transcript available)

In this special 100th episode, Chris Dixon sits down with Palmer Luckey — founder of Anduril, founder of Oculus VR, and designer of the Oculus Rift — for a wide-ranging conversation on the future of technology, geopolitics, and building.

Recorded live at our Founders Summit, the discussion explores what it really takes to build hardware at scale, where today’s biggest technological bottlenecks lie, and why optimism about the future is still warranted despite geopolitical turmoil, regulatory constraints, and other barriers to innovation. Dixon and Luckey cover crypto, banking, and stablecoins, as well as modern warfare, defense technology, the U.S.–China technology race, AI and manufacturing, and the next frontiers of innovation — from fusion to quantum computing.

The conversation also dives into company building in both good times and bad, including lessons from Oculus, the founding of Anduril, and how to build mission-driven teams that can operate at scale.
