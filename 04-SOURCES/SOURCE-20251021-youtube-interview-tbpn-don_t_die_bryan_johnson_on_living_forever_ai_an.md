# Don't Die: Bryan Johnson on Living Forever, AI, and Blueprint's $60M Round

## Executive Summary

Bryan Johnson—founder of Braintree/Venmo, now Blueprint—presents the "Don't Die" philosophy as both civilizational positioning and commercial strategy. The $60M raise marks mainstream acceptance of longevity as a category. The deeper thesis: Blueprint is "entirely about AI alignment"—caring for your body is caring for intelligence, and the coming autonomous health systems will run on your behalf as AI matures. A Western thought macro-cycle is ending; we're overdue for a paradigm shift from capitalism-as-scarcity to purpose-as-abundance.

## Key Insights

### "Don't Die" as Philosophy, Not Slogan
Saying yes to "don't die" means: "I value existence, I respect existence." The endeavor is "entirely about AI alignment"—when you care for yourself, you care for your body, when you care for your body, you care for intelligence. It's a holistic acknowledgment of existence at this pivotal moment.

### Autonomous Health Systems
Karpathy's autonomous systems framing applied to health: currently we chase down food, protocols, evidence ourselves. In the future, "it will just be run for us." Blueprint is building autonomous health infrastructure—digital, food, prescriptions, testing—that rides scientific breakthroughs as they emerge. "We are going to build your autonomous self."

### Macro Frame: End of Western Thought Era
Aristotle → Christianity → Medieval → Renaissance → Enlightenment → Modern Science → [?]. We're at the tail end, overdue for a major shift. Capitalism was for solving scarcity; we're now in compulsive consumption. Democracy was freedom of choice; we're now addicted and choiceless. Sleep and exercise matter, but the larger frame is "what it means to be intelligent, make decisions. You can't when you're addicted to everything."

### Business Model: Collapse the Category
Blueprint = "home base for longevity, win the early innings, then ride the multi-trillion dollar market." Like Braintree/Stripe collapsing payments, Blueprint aims to collapse the fragmented health/longevity space into a unified, evidence-based, biomarker-led experience. "Once you collapse the entire space, it's very hard to get in."

### AGI Definition via Psychology
When will AGI arrive? Johnson's framing: "When will humans feel useless?" The psychological transition point where AI does everything so well that humans face existential purposelessness. Karpathy's vision (gym + learning) may persist, but without "the tension of stress and real life," leisure becomes uncomfortable. "Competing on biomarkers" may become the final status game.

## Quotable Passages

> "Blueprint is the practical implementation of this philosophy. When you say yes to don't die, you're saying I value existence, I respect existence... this endeavor is entirely about AI alignment." — Bryan Johnson

> "We're basically trying to build your autonomous system of health, and we're going to ride the breakthroughs of science." — Bryan Johnson

> "Capitalism was for solving scarcity. We're now compulsive. Democracy was freedom of choice. We now have no longer choice because we're addicted." — Bryan Johnson on macro transitions

> "Once you collapse the entire space, it's very hard to get in." — Bryan Johnson on competitive strategy

> "My definition of AGI: when will humans feel useless? When AI does everything so well you feel this deep hole in your stomach of like, what do I do?" — Bryan Johnson

## Integration Notes

- Connects to CANON-35100-TRANSCENDENCE: "Don't Die" philosophy is a transcendence framework; AGI-as-uselessness maps to existential transitions
- Connects to CANON-33100-EFFICACY: The "collapse the category" strategy from Braintree to Blueprint is a transferable framework
- Connects to CANON-10000-CELESTIAL_BODY: Autonomous health systems connect to Seven Pulses and personal practice infrastructure
- Novel contribution: AGI defined psychologically rather than technically—"when humans feel useless"
- Novel contribution: Western thought macro-cycle reaching end; new paradigm required

## Metadata

- Duration: ~60 minutes
- Quality: Good—wide-ranging conversation with commercial and philosophical content
- Processing notes: Johnson speaks in frameworks; high signal on strategy and philosophy, some tangential content on products


## Transcript

We are the first generation who won't
die. It's less about living forever.
It's more about a philosophy of yes,
this moment is big. What a lot of people
don't realize is this endeavor is
entirely about AI alignment. Now AI is a
tool like we feel more productive with
it.
>> Yes.
>> At what point will do everything so well
you feel this deep hole in your stomach
of like what do I do?
>> We have Brian Johnson. Welcome to the
stream. Go over there. Uh while he hops
on, let me tell you about AI. Google
Google AI Studio, the fastest way from
promp [music] to production with Gemini,
chat with models, vibe code, and monitor
usage. Thank you.
>> Uh classic LA story.
>> Good to see you again.
>> People in LA arrive on time 15 minutes
after you normally arrive.
>> Oh, yeah.
>> At least I do normally.
>> Yeah, that's the nature.
>> Uh hopefully you didn't have too much
traffic. It's great to have you here. Uh
big week for you.
>> It's been a great week for us.
>> Yeah, congratulations. uh 60 million but
break down exactly what happened what
what was the impetus for the deal uh
take us through the recent history of
blueprint
>> I mean I started this this is the idea
that you know we are the first
generation who won't die
>> it's kind of a crazy idea we started
this a couple years ago and I think a
lot of people thought this was kind of
an insane
>> pro thought process and so we've been
hammering away and I think it's gone
from weird to interesting to yesterday
was kind of like now it's accepted and
maybe even cool.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> And so I think we've it's a it's a thing
now. It's a part of the zeitgeist and I
think it formalizes that we're really
going to take a a shot at this.
>> Yeah. So, I mean there's like the
philosophical underpinning where you're
I imagine you know in in the vein of
Kerszswall like looking at long-term
trends artificial intelligence uh
compounding
just the value of compounding little
gains all over the the health system
potentially could at least in your
belief get us to infinite life and not
die. Don't die. So you get to that but
then you you know at some point need to
instantiate that in a company in a
business in a suite of products and so
that's what blueprint is today. Is that
the idea of of the the fund raise is
that what people are investing in?
>> Yeah the idea is um
>> when somebody says yes I want to be
healthy it's pretty hard you have to go
out and you have to navigate a thousand
things you know like is this good for me
or is it bad for me? You have people who
have conflicting opinions
>> and so our target customer is somebody
who says I want to be healthy. and we
just say, "We've got you."
>> Yeah.
>> We will give you like the protein
amounts. We'll give you tested and
certified foods. We'll give you the
exact dose. We'll help you with your
prescriptions. We'll give you protocols.
Like
>> your autonomous self, like it's not go
navigate the world by yourself. It's
we've got you. Yeah.
>> And we'll do an evidence-based biomarker
approach. One of the uh I feel like
anybody that really gets into health
goes through a period where they realize
I I at least at one point I was like 19
at the time realized that it felt like I
was spending like 50% of all my
cognitive power on just like trying to
be as healthy as possible. And at a
certain point I realized like this is
such an inefficient use of time.
Fortunately, you build up some habits
and kind of like understanding of what's
good and what's bad and what you want to
uh leverage more and and kind of avoid
and all that stuff, but uh I think like
make you know removing that uh step from
the process of being able to just kind
of like default into a system. Um, walk
can can you get into a little bit more
of like I I I remember reading a post at
this point from you maybe it was like a
couple months ago kind of like talking
through the decision- making around um
you know where you wanted to take
blueprint uh why kind of raise capital
all that kind of thing.
>> Yeah. I mean it was this um I mean I
guess I my sole objective is try to be
sober in this moment and I really enjoy
the perspective of thinking a few
hundred years into the future. You look
back at this moment and we are giving
birth to some kind of super
intelligence. We don't know what it is.
We don't know what kind of scale but
it's big. It's important. Uh I have
neither an opinion that it's positive or
negative. It's just significant.
>> And I was really trying to think through
does it even matter if I build anything
in the world right now or should I work
on building the philosophy and the moral
framework on like what does it mean to
be intelligent on planet Earth in this
part of the galaxy? M
>> and I was kind of in the middle of like
as an entrepreneur do you build or like
which way do you build and so I was just
reflecting that am I misallocating my
time and I thought you know really
blueprint is the practical
implementation of this philosophy like
when you say yes to don't die you're
saying I value existence I respect
existence and so it's it's less about
living forever it's more about a
philosophy of yes this moment is big and
so what a lot of people don't realize is
this endeavor is entirely about AI
alignment.
>> Yeah.
>> I mean that's the sole thing happening
on the planet right now. And so when you
take care of yourself, you take care of
your body, when you take care of the
body, you take care of intelligence,
like it's like it's this holistic system
of we acknowledge existence. So it's
that was it. It was like I was trying to
figure out as a human, what do I do on
planet Earth right now and how do I
spend my time? I'm an entrepreneur. My
intuitions are to become an
entrepreneur, but I wondered is that
really the the right way to do it?
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. What is what does Blueprint look
like in a decade? It feels like you're
it's such a unique consumer package
goods business because you can't even
call it that. It's like I mean I I
understand that there's like the
philosophy and I I love that as the
brand but even just in terms of like the
business of like what people pay for
there's a lot and that's just that just
such a contrarian approach to this this
category because so many people are like
I have an idea I'm going to make coffee
better. I'm going to make a greens
powder better or I have an opinion about
the the burger or the meat or the food
or one particular thing and then they
grow and grow and grow and then 5 years
in they're like let's do a line
extension. Let's do
>> Yeah. The CPG trend of the last 10 years
was go walk into the gas station, find a
product that's popular and make a a
version of it that's like 50% healthier
and then you probably have like a nine
figure revenue business
>> or make nothing like Thrive Market,
Arowan. There's a bunch of companies
that have been like we're just be the
the seller of everything. How did you
land on like I want to kind of make
everything that feels like an immense
challenge. Yeah. I want to walk through
all that.
>> I mean that's what you know Kaparthi was
talking about the autonomous systems
with Door Cache. Yeah. Like that then
and he and I think very similar in this
way is that if you model out what AI
systems will do, they'll probably take
on more autonomous responsibility in our
lives.
>> We see beginnings where you plug an
address in to a car and it helps you
navigate to the place. You don't think
about it much.
>> Yep. We're going to build our autonomous
self. Our health will be run on our
behalf. So right now we have to chase
down all our food. We have to chase down
protocols. We have to chase down
evidence. But it's not going to be that
in the future. It will be that it will
just be run for us and as we get
measurement that's more high fidelity.
So blueprint is basically we're saying
we are going to build your autonomous
system of health and we're going to ride
the breakthroughs of science so that as
we make better progress in lowering the
speed of aging and reversing aging
damage, you can just say I'm in and I'm
going to ride with you. We're going to
try to be on the very very forefront
>> to help people have, you know, the best
possible health. So we're just building
out autonomous health systems. Yeah,
that feels like super valuable just from
the consumer experience of like I I'm
I'm delegating all of that hassle. I
know basically if I buy one from one
brand, it it's all aligned with one
philosophy, which is great. Um what does
that mean on the logistics side? What
does that mean on the capex side? What
does that mean on the operational cost
side? Do you have like 25 different
product managers for each niche? Like
what's the shape of the company? This
feels like a big challenge.
>> A very big challenge. were standing up
like 10 different businesses at the same
time.
>> Exactly. Like there's plenty of people
that could have done what you did where
they like become famous or they become
content creators in one way or another
and then they're like now I have one
product and you're like now I have how
many products do you actually have?
>> Over 20.
>> Over 20. Yeah. Uh and it's clear that
like you probably a lot of that comes
from the fact that you've been a
successful entrepreneur before. You're
like yeah I can probably do more than
just one. But uh but what what what
actually does the what does the does the
business look like? Does the system look
like? Are there cross-selling benefits
in retail on day one or is this just an
e-commerce play on day one? Like, how do
you think about the the costs and
benefits of going multi-product so soon?
>> Yeah. I mean, the thing is that when
people want to be healthy, you can't
just address one thing. They're still
left with 99 things to deal with.
>> I totally get the consumer value makes a
ton of sense.
>> So, internally, we're basically building
out the infrastructure to deliver every
single channel. So digital food, uh,
prescriptions, testing, so we could say
like
>> so much stuff.
>> It is so much stuff, you know, like this
is what so I've done this myself for the
past, you know, like 5 years. We've
mastered the system for me
>> and, you know, I've been fighting to
achieve the best biomarkers in the
world. Kind of in some sense a like a
ridiculous idea, but also like it's a
new sport. Like you can imagine it
becoming a thing. Um, so yeah, I mean
basically we've mastered it, we've built
it, now we're just productizing. So
yeah, people do.
>> So where are the images of the What is
how do you think about so so every every
consumer out there has probably at some
point or another gone through the
frustration of of finding a product they
love and then watching the company
behind it or sometimes an acquire just
like steadily just like try to maintain
or increase their margins to the point
where it's no longer that it might have
similar looking packaging but it's no
longer the same product like like I
imagine like you want blueprint to be
the thing that you are relying on for
the majority of your calories, the
majority of the supplements you take,
the majority of the drugs that you are
going to uh leverage. And so uh I can
imagine like you know holding the
company to that standard so that you're
not having to go anywhere else or
realize like oh this product would
actually be better for me. But like do
you have any kind of like ethos around
that? because that just feels like
every, you know, I try to be cognizant
of like when a company goes from founder
to uh they've exited and the new
acquirer is just going to say like, hey,
you know, we could actually source this
salt from over here and we're going to
save like 80% and nobody's really going
to notice cuz it's going to taste
similar. But then the tests start
showing up and it's actually like got
lead in it now or whatever.
>> Yeah, exactly. Right. I mean, I'm
Blueprint's number one customer. I
appreciate it so much, you know, because
like we when we first started doing this
project, I was testing everything I put
into my body. Air, water, food, like
everything. And I learned first of all,
food is guilty until proven innocent.
Like it is so toxic. It's no matter
where you get it.
>> Yeah. People were freaking out last week
when there was that uh protein powder
report came out that a bunch of them had
lead in it. And I was like I my
immediate reaction was like obviously a
lot of this stuff has lead in it. I mean
like look at the average chocolate bar
has like a ton of lead in it
>> and that's it's not even so you can to
isolate that one toxin but there's so
many other toxin. So people they they
grab onto one concept that they
understand it's like oh that's bad.
>> There's trace levels of heavy metals in
all of our foods. Yeah.
>> So like the fact that it's there is not
unarming. It's just it's out of context
but it's at a level people understand.
But you know the goal is I'm going to
>> blueprint is my way to try to achieve
you know this don't die and so people
will be just riding along. We build on
population level data. So this is not
about Brian Johnson's body. This is
about everybody's body. So all ages,
both genders. But no, I think we're
being meticulous about what we do.
>> And so it will be the quality will be
the best in the world. And so I care
about it. I'm consuming all about
myself.
>> Yeah. what what uh what's the plans on
the kind of tele medicine front for uh
for uh kind of interventions or
therapies that require uh doctors kind
of involvement. Is there anything on
that front?
>> We will build an infrastructure to
basically when you want a prescription
if you want to go on a GLP1 we can help
you get started whether you want a large
dose or micro dose.
You're just like, "Yeah, and also I'll
do the lab testing and also like build
the, you know, the I'll I'll I'll be
mining the metal that gets turned into
the needle that injects you with the
[laughter] like you want to hold up the
entire global economy." I love it. It's
good ambition. I I I I strongly support
this. Uh yeah, I I was interested in
like like where are the edges of like
what you'd be like, "Yeah, actually I'm
not going to go into that market." But
it feels like you'll just continue to
work on it until you get to some status
where you're like, "Yeah, actually it's
would you would you go into hospitality?
Would you create like physical kind of
like if you want if you want to get 100%
European these European kind of uh
health retreats that are very like
evidence- driven and they're testing
focus I could imagine a blueprint
retreat center that that people can
visit once a year to
>> we have about a dozen groups around the
world that want to stand this up and
some of the biggest hotel chains around
the world they because the thing is they
just want credibility they want to say
like come here we have this thing
structured when I meet with some of the
most powerful people in the
They're just as clueless as everyone
else. It is not a like people imagine
rich and powerful people just have it
solved. That is not the case.
>> And so yeah, we are going to stand this
up. We probably will not do physical
clinics. It's just too much on the real
estate. And so we'll probably license it
out.
>> Sure.
>> We probably do the digital model. We
have
>> model.
>> We have trust like we want to have like
we could do a model across food and
clinics where we have this
evidence-based approach. So yeah, I mean
we're we're kind of in it to just
blanket the entire industry with a
framework on how to do things in a
credible way that's biomarkerled,
evidence-based.
>> Yeah. Uh what was the thesis behind the
round? $60 million, tons of faces, not
the traditional CPG VCs, private equity
folks, like what was the thesis?
>> Yeah. I mean, so I I've been funding the
company myself up until this point.
Yeah. And you know, I guess I just
wanted my friends to come along with me.
The So these are people I talk to in
private. They enjoy it. They're into it.
And I think a lot of people, they have
not known how to think about me. Like,
am I legit? Am I not? Is this a thing?
Is this weird?
>> And then they see that list of investors
are like, "Oh shit."
>> And so like yesterday, I think was the
first day it was like, "Oh, it's safe to
say this is cool." Whereas before
>> that flipped like a long time ago.
>> Yeah. I I I feel like the I feel like
that the first like business I What was
the first piece that you did that was
like I spent $2 million on my health and
that went super viral.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Two or three years ago.
>> That was like two or three years ago. I
feel like that was the moment where
people my personal view pretty quickly
people dug into your backtory and were
like, "Oh yeah, you sold a movie."
>> Yeah. My personal view is is America has
has over the last few years had so
little trust in health institutions.
like if you just went and followed the
American Heart Association's guidance,
I'd probably die at like 60, [laughter]
right? And so, so to me, I was always
like, you know, knowing how much I I you
can read about health and you can listen
to podcasts and you can listen to what
some influencer said in a short form
video, but to deeply understand your
health, you have to do
self-experimentation. Everybody is
different. And so I always looked at it,
you know, you you always tried to be
controversial enough to like generate
attention, attract some people that were
going to become super fans and lose some
people and you were kind of okay with
that. But my my sense was always like,
thank you that somebody is going to
invest more money than basically anyone
else and just self-experimentation and
then open source all of that and now
people can buy your olive oil if they
want or they can decide no, I'm actually
going to go on my own journey and try to
find some
>> uh some product that can fit this
requirement. Um, but it felt like such a
public benefit that I always wish there
was like
>> a thousand Brian Johnson's that were
just all running the same
experimentation open sourcing process
versus the biggest thing we we talked
about this the other day is
>> health influencers quickly get into
>> put themselves in a niche and they're
like I'm the I'm the the fasting guy.
I'm the HRV guy. And then every single
thing becomes about that.
>> Yeah. And it's cool because you can like
tap into a world and like kind of
accelerate and understand a lot about a
category, but then in reality it's not
like fasting is the only thing that
matters. It's just like one tool. So
>> I have another take on on that that
maybe I'd like your reaction to. Uh
there's also this this trend in health
influence where if I want to blow
everyone's brain, I'm going to come in
and uh blow everyone's mind. I'll be
like, "Guess what? I boil it all down.
It's uh sleep, diet, and exercise.
That's like 99% of what you need to do.
And everyone's like, "Man, this John
Guy, he's not talking about the crazy
supplements. He's just telling it like
it is. Sleep, diet, exercise. I did it.
I feel great. This is amazing." And then
after I've made, you know, one hour of
content every week for 5 years on sleep,
diet, exercise. I'm like, "You know
what? Let's actually talk about like the
17th piece of magnesium you should take
or like that the thing that's Yeah, it
is beneficial, but it's 0.001% Oh, 1%.
And and it's still interesting, but it's
not going to have the power law effect
of like actually start working out or
like actually get sleep. And so, do you
wrestle with that? Do you feel like you
have to go back to the basics sometimes
or or do you think that there's there's
actually maybe that's not even that's
not even a reasonable critique?
>> Yeah. I think that the the thing that
most people struggle with is doing
things they don't want to do.
>> Like they don't want to overeat.
>> They don't want to eat a pint of ice
cream. like they don't want to drink,
you know, you know. So,
>> yeah,
>> those things are really the highest
leverage interventions. It's it's behav
it's behavioral. Yeah.
>> And so, yes, you can say sleep that
exercise, but you get deep and you then
uncover that American like our American
society is one of addiction.
>> Sure.
>> Like the American powers of capitalism
have pointed at getting people to be
addicted on food,
>> right? Sugar, nicotine, porn, junk food,
like all of it. And so this is like if
you look at so like just from a broad
perspective you begin on western thought
with political Aristotle Christianity
medieval times renaissance uh
enlightenment and modern scientific era.
Yeah.
>> Like you look at these big frames we're
due for a major shift and right now
we're at the tail end. This is like kind
of a dio kind of thought process of like
these big macro trends.
>> Yeah.
>> We're at the end and right now you know
capitalism was for solving scarcity.
We're now compulsive. Right. We're now
compulsive. Yeah.
>> And the idea was democracy was freedom
of choice. We now have no longer choice
because we're addicted.
>> So we're really playing on this very big
macro frame of we're at different time
as a species. And so yes, sleep that
exercise, but in this larger frame,
>> it's about what does it mean to actually
be intelligent, make decisions, and you
can't when you're addicted to
everything.
>> Yeah. What what do you think about some
of the longer tale interventions like
the the the like the third peptide
that's not approved yet, but people are
already taking it here? It feels like is
this sort of like unsegulated
unregulated biohacking becoming more
prevalent? Is that the correct world in
a world where the FDA is broken or does
the FDA need to change or how how do how
should we like map the you know
accelerating advances in science with
maybe stagnation in regulatory? What's
your framework for that?
>> Yeah, I mean peptides are very powerful.
They're basically drugs. Okay, right. So
you get access to drug-like effect
sizes. The problem is peptides are often
times not manufactured to spec and so
you have
>> risks like putting stuff in your body
that you shouldn't be put in your body
>> like they could have lead in them just
like your chocolate bar
>> and a bunch of other stuff. Same with
stem cells. So like there's there's a
real quality problem.
>> The other problem is peptides a lot of
peptides are not fully well
characterized. So typically drugs you
say like you can do this thing but also
here's the long list of side effects.
Yeah. And that's nice because it's like
okay at least I know what the trade-off
space is. With these peptides you don't
have the characterization. Okay. And so
it's a bigger risk that people
experiment. You see a lot of this in
bodybuilding now. You have bioarker bio
hackers doing it. So it's fine. It's
just you have to understand it's the
wild wild west. That may be your game.
It may not. But like it's definitely you
want to be cautious. It's not like a
safe path. But then there's other things
like
>> you start with the highest level of
evidence. You know sauna is great.
>> Yeah.
>> But you know like if you I've talked
about this a lot. If you don't ice the
boys in the sauna
>> you crush.
>> Can you make a ice pack? I used to I
used to I think we maybe talked about
this last time. I used to there used to
be this ice pack on Amazon that was for
this use case and they stopped selling
it and now I don't I I like I lost I
lost my
>> Yeah. They don't want you icing your
boys out there. I don't think they want
that. Yeah.
>> And then a lot of men will say like I'm
not trying to have you know babies so it
doesn't matter but has negative feedback
>> hormone hormone health. Exactly.
Interesting.
>> So yeah there so yes sleep that exercise
is great but then you dive into the
details. This is what I'm saying. Like
you you start down this path and you
inevitably will spend 50% of your time
chasing down everything
>> some sort of weird root cause on
whatever it is.
>> It's never easy. So you have infinite
chase. And that's what I'm saying is
that's the problem I'm trying to solve
is nobody has 50% of their time to do
this.
>> How uh how how are you thinking about
wearables? Because there's a world in
the future where you have a camera
that's effectively a sensor that's able
to experience life in your in your view.
And that as like a health co-pilot would
be pretty wild because you be like,
"Hey, hey, you you've already eaten
like, you know, well beyond you assume
that like cameras get better at like
calorie tracking. It's like, hey, you're
well over like uh your daily caloric
needs. Like you're now going into a
surplus. Maybe ease off and maybe that's
enough."
>> Meta Rayban displays like need a killer
app. That sounds like something you
should build. What do you Yeah. I mean
the if you think about it GLP1s are kind
of that
>> I mean a little bit right it's like it's
like modulating your hunger your satiety
and it's like so
>> how do you how do you think uh we'll
view GLP1s and the the explosion of
their use in 50 years.
>> It's probably the most successful
anti-aging drug ever built.
>> It's incredible.
>> Yeah. It's like you the benefits keep on
accumulating. Yes, there's drawbacks.
They're getting better all the time. But
>> you feel the same way about statins?
>> Uh those are they're complicated. I
mean, statins do have benefits, but
they're complicated.
>> Um, do you feel like there's any value
to reading into the uh the the
conspiracy
uh like weird vibes around the fact that
like Ozmpic came from a demon like this
Hila monster? [laughter] Isn't that what
it is? He monster.
>> Is it the Hila monster komodo dragon
venom or something like that? Like it
just feels like wrong, right? If you're
just like, you know, just humanity 101,
he'd be like, "Yeah, don't drink.
>> Don't become the reptile.
>> Don't drink the reptile venom." I mean,
>> you're you're he Brian might be trying
to become the reptile. Are you into it?
>> The Senorian Toad gave us 5 MO DMT.
>> And I would say that that's bad, too.
[laughter]
That that throwed off all sorts of red
flags for me.
>> It just got FDA approval. It did. It
did. Break the status for treat uh
depression treat uh resistant
depression.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Treatment resistant
depression. Yeah. Yeah. Got it. Yeah.
>> Uh so yeah, I mean I guess if you're
sad, you need the CH you need the toad
to to cheer you up, I suppose. Happy I'm
I'm happy if it's helping people. I'm
happy. Uh it is it is just funny when we
were we we we were looking at the story
of Ozmpic like a year ago. What's your
what's your view on uh I think
everybody's hoping maybe maybe GLP ones
are this and and people haven't sort of
fully realized it yet, but everybody is
kind of I feel like for a while just
hoping that like oh by the time that I'm
I'm a I'm really aging like I'm really
feeling it uh there will just be a pill
that I can take and you know I'll just
be able to halt or maybe even reverse.
Are you like how open to to you how open
are you to the idea that like there
could be something that is like an order
of magnitude more effective than GLP-1s
in terms of anti-aging? Like are you you
know where where do you put the
probability there?
>> I mean that study that came out in from
China in June they showed that they took
this form of a FOX3 protein they used
crisper they put it in a messenal stem
cell and delivered it via introvenous
treatment. It had a a biological
equivalent for human anti. So this was
in monkeys. It had a 3 to five year age
reversal in over 50% of the tissues
which is unseen
>> and for human equivalent that'd be like
9 to 15 years roughly. So
>> these demonstrations are being done. I
think we'll probably I was going to
actually figure this out. You know the
the hype cycle where you you um
>> Yeah. Gartner hype cycle.
>> Exactly. Yeah. Dissolution plateau
productivity. I was going to model this
out this week. Try to figure out like
because I think we're probably going to
hit peak in something like
>> GOP ones or something.
>> 2032, you likeish like
>> okay,
>> okay, we got some time. We're still
going.
>> A few things will hit people like it's
here and then
>> oh and people will think that they're
going to live forever and then there
will be a crash and be like oh actually
there's still more problems to solve.
>> Exactly. 2035 2037 people like oh man
like it's not solving this or that or we
have these complications and like maybe
early 2040s people are like actually we
got this like something like that
>> I saw some post
>> crazy like inbound from from mad
scientists all over the world that are
like hey I made this thing I was talking
with chat GBT for 50 hours over the last
week and I figured out like let me let
me come inject you
>> when I was when I was building kernel
with this brain interface I would get
all these emails that people are like
I've been implanted by the government.
>> Oh, right. So, that would come in. But
now, yes. Like I do I get I don't know
maybe like seven to 10 a day.
>> Whoa. People offering you experimental
>> feel like I've I've discovered the
quantum realm and how the how
>> sick.
>> Yes. [laughter]
It's wild. People are excited about this
topic.
>> Maybe some toads involved in that one.
It's funny. Yeah. I remember seeing this
post a while back. I don't know if you
remember it better than I do, but it was
basically looking at like the the
distribution of lifespans is not there's
not just a single power law where
everyone falls off at like 90. Like you
would expect if it was just a normal
power law that we would get a couple 150
and like one 200y old person, but in
fact there are like this double
exponential effect. Yeah. And so maybe
that's kind of what happens where you
maybe we solve one of them but then we
still are at this like you know
exponential fall off in longevity but
even unlocking like one person at 200
would be amazing.
>> Yeah. There was this interesting paper
that came out of Levven uh so he said um
his theory after running this model was
that basically after
>> we reproduce our cells lose purpose like
we our cells don't have a unifying
objective. Yeah. So they just like aging
just like we just don't know what to do.
>> Interesting. And
>> so if his model is correct like biology
needs don't die like they actually need
an objective at a macro scale like at
our level of cognition but also at a
cellular level. But I think like these
are the kinds of experiments people are
being are doing of like what
what is the underlying incentive
structure of biology? Why do we age? Why
do we not age in certain parts of our
life? Why do we have protective
mechanisms? You know why do some species
regenerate? So, I think it's this really
exciting frontier where our ideas now of
aging are beginning to crack open a
little bit and expanding our horizons
like how do we think about time and
>> I mean we talked about this last time
you were on about Warren Buffett,
Charlie Mer uh not particularly famous
for their biohacking but uh incredibly
resilient uh well like a life well-lived
uh so many stories about them like you
know staying up drinking Coca-Cola and
wine long into the night and I I want to
believe that there's some level of just
if you have a purpose, if you have
drive, your body just pulls it together
a little bit more.
>> I I know people want this to be like the
answer, you know, [laughter]
it's such I think it's really such a bad
idea because people in their mind, they
make that shortcut and they're like, you
know what? I've got I just got to work
harder. I got to work harder.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> Uh did we did we cure uh balding? There
was that study was it last week?
>> They're all such they're weak effects.
Yeah. But you we really have not made I
guess
>> so long turkey.
>> It's a little bit embarrassing as a
human race that we haven't been able to
make really good strides on hair loss.
>> That one seems very simple. I don't
know. It just seems like very
mechanical. You know, it it doesn't seem
as complicated as like, you know, your
brain degenerating. We don't even know
how the brain works. It's like it's
hair. It just grows. Like it's should be
easy.
>> We're working on it. We just put out our
best attempt and we're going to see if
it works. Like uh we're going to try to
beat every everything that's out there
on market.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> We'll see. How important is uh is like
cosmetic
intervention to the blueprint plan? Like
because you could imagine a world where
people will say, "Yeah, make me live
forever, but I don't care about wrinkles
and hair because unless it's going to
help me actually live longer."
>> Yeah.
>> Why bother?
>> I mean, the thing is this don't die is
really be hot. Like what? [laughter]
Like what? every every every every
supplement company, every every company
in health, you're ultimately selling at
the end of the day.
>> I I think this is brilliant from a
business perspective, but does it make
sense in terms of the science? Like does
it take something out of
>> Yeah. Like being hot is good science,
you know, like if you look youthful and
vibrant, your skin is nice and like you
you're you have a lot of energy. So I
think be hot is legit the path for this.
>> Okay. Yeah.
>> Be hot, don't die.
>> How do you think about longevity in the
business? you know, uh, if you look at,
uh, the DTOC bubble, there was a lot of
companies that raised similar amount of
money and and, you know, are are no
longer with us. I imagine you care about
a lot about just making sure that don't
die and Blueprint
>> survive decades and I'm sure that's
informing the way you're building the
>> I mean, this is like you, you know, the
internet comes about, Google sets up
shop and rides that tailwind. Amazon
sets up shop on on commerce, right? M
>> basically somebody's going to set up
shop in longevity
>> and ride a multi- trillion ride.
>> So that's what we're trying to do is
we're trying to just be home base, win
the early innings of longevity and then
ride for the multi- trillion dollar
market.
>> Yeah. Do you think there's a lot of like
I imagine M&A will be pretty important
to your strategy. There's a lot of
companies I mean I just view there's a
lot of companies that are important that
are like single product or for specific
use cases that don't really necessarily
need or shouldn't be because like if
you're a blueprint customer maybe you
need it once every 3 years
>> but that means it could be harder to
actually build a business around but it
would slot in.
>> You nailed it. So basically if you look
at the landscape in health right now
nothing is proprietary.
>> You basic you got wearables from all
these different providers you have food
from different providers. you have
biomarkers like nothing proprietary
>> and so the winner's going to have to out
compete everybody and bringing a an
experience
>> to the customer that is sensible and
practical and make you know so I think
that's that's where the competition is
going to be because this is like the
days when I was building a braintree
Venmo is it was commoditized like you're
all in the Visa Mastercard MX Discover
uh stack and you have to build something
unique and then uh Brainree and Stripe
just collapsed the market.
>> Yeah. Uh how do you think about wait I
now I want to hear the story of uh of
the Venmo acquisition. How did that
happen?
>> Yeah, they so they built up a vent. So
people in payments it was very clear
PayPal was the only company making
money.
>> Okay.
>> Because they had both sides of the
market. Sure.
>> They got lucky because they got into
eBay. They built the consumer side but
then they had the merchant side too.
Because otherwise if you just offer it
to merchants your margins are pretty
low, right? You're making whatever
>> 20 50 basis points something like that.
And so everybody was going after PayPal
trying to build a two-sided marketplace.
And that took a lot of capital. It's
very hard to build from scratch. And so
I said, "Okay, I'm going to build uh the
merchant side of the business uh first
and then I'm going to acquire the
consumer side." I said this when I
started the company.
>> So we got customers like Airbnb, Uber,
GitHub. Uh we got all the Gen Z people
and then Venmo had done a fantastic job
building out consumer side and we could
then marry those two demographics and
it's like
>> perfect. And so yeah, so they had built
a great business, but they hadn't solved
making money.
>> Okay.
>> When they plugged into our world, we
bought them for 26.2 million.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> How much of that was uh like not making
money because of fraud? I hear that like
a lot of fintech companies like they
actually have something where the unit
economic should work, but it's always
crazy in the early days. You hear the
story about PayPal where PayPal was
losing tons of money, but it was only
because of fraud. the actual business
when it wasn't fraudulent made sense.
But then once you get to scale, you can
do the anti- fraud properly. Was that
something that you were problem solving
around?
>> It's very hard again because you're
doing peerto-peer and typically you have
like like illicit purposes primarily as
your driver and so it's a very hard
problem. So as a standalone, it's hard
for them to make sense because you if
you have if you stack on a fee when
you're paying your buddy, it's hard
friction in the adoption. So you have to
kind of speedrun adoption and then make
money later. Yep.
>> But there was no good make money later
problem.
big cash.
>> Do you uh I I was running uh I think it
was a shower thought. I was like, "Okay,
there's so much cap capital slloshing
around the private markets. It's been
interesting that we haven't seen more
people like try to take on Stripe. I
don't know if it's I don't I'd be
curious uh from your point of view
at what point will people even try to
climb that mountain?"
>> Very unlikely. They've done such a great
job executing. I I sold uh Brainree in
2013. So they've been building 12 years
since. They've done such a good job
making that airtight.
>> They're just great.
>> That's this is the thing is like
>> Yeah. You can't come in and make it 10x
better product.
>> Am Amazon locked commerce. So you of
course can build your e-commerce
business on Shopify but at a scale. I
mean Amazon has just kind of owned that
entire thing. It's very hard to
replicate that. So that's that's our
goal too is we're basically trying to do
that for longevity is once you collapse
the entire space it just it's very hard
to get in.
>> Okay. We got a lightning round. Favorite
book?
>> Um
>> or just a book recommendation. Something
you read recently that you like.
>> Um I just finished uh The History of the
Western Mind going through all of
Western thought.
>> Oh, cool. Uh favorite music? What's in
your
>> You know, I have such a soft spot for
Eminem. When I was when I was depressed,
he was the only artist that I I could
fill.
>> Okay. Love it. Uh, when will humanity
develop AGI?
[laughter]
>> We such are hard. You don't want to
sound like a D cell. You don't want to
be
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. Um,
>> just call it right now. Yeah, we I want
to be able to clip this [laughter] the
day of and be like
>> I want to say I want to say that uh I
want to say that we'll be nice to you
and we won't clip this, but I know our
clipping infrastructure and we
absolutely will clip this.
>> It's such a sucker question. [laughter]
>> Uh well well may maybe let's flip it
around. Uh OpenAI and Microsoft did this
deal where where the the the definition
of AGI will be convened by a group of
experts. What is your definition of AGI?
Um I I approach this question as a
more through psychology of when will
humans
>> feel useless
>> feel useless.
>> Yes. Like our entire identity is based
upon like we do things we contribute we
build.
>> Yes.
>> And now AI is a tool like we feel more
productive with it.
>> Yes.
>> At what point will it do everything so
well you feel this deep
>> hole in your stomach of like what do I
do? So, what if Yeah, the weird thing is
like computers are incredible at chess,
yet people play chess for fun and at the
professional level because humans, I
guess they're anti-clanker and they like
watching humans play chess. And if we
can solve that for everyone so that
everyone has some sort of even like in
this AGI world where there's no more
real jobs there's no more actual okay
you need to produce something for food
or you know uh livability everything is
just for fun or for games and for status
and it's all about uh wasn't Andre
Kopathy saying you go to the gym and
you'll learn in the future and it's and
I wonder like if your definition is once
that breaks down That is feels really
far. I like that. I like that.
>> Like people look forward to retirement.
Like retirement is a goal. It's an
ideal. It's like we're gonna get an RV.
We're going to cruise the country. Then
they retire. They're like this sucks.
Like there's not the tension.
>> So if we imagine we're going to like
learn and we're going to like do yoga
all day and paint and but like if
there's not the tension of the stress
and the of real life, like do we really
want to be on vacation all the time? Do
we want to be at leisure? So that's my
like what I think about is when that
happens that's a pretty unnerving
situation because humans don't do well
with that uncertainty and then our
systems have to respond. So like that's
what I really think about all day.
>> Everyone in the end is just going to be
competing on biomarkers. It's going to
be [laughter] the final it's going to be
the final status game. The final game
>> that aligns with Carpathy's take. Uh
last lightning round question and then I
want you to ring the gong. Um favorite
vacation spot. Where would you go for
maybe a trip?
>> Redwood forest. Redwood forest. I love
redwood.
>> Staying in California.
>> Yeah, I would love I love redwoods.
Let's go. Right. Like there.
>> This is John. There's John. I love
California. You don't need to go to
Europe.
>> I love America. I don't
>> You don't need to get all the radiation
on the plane. Just stay here.
>> They're like such beautiful, majestic
creatures
>> and they live a long time.
>> They live a long time.
>> It's very on brand for you. I love it.
Uh congratulations on the round. $60
million. Fantastic progress. I'd love
for you to ring that gong and I'd love
for you to ring it at a at a decibel
level that you feel is appropriate for
uh hearing. You know, actually, let me
Yeah, let me teach us.
>> Yeah, let me pull out my decel. Do we
have my phone?
>> Let's make sure we get this.
>> Yes, let's bring over
>> We don't want to be over 80 dB.
>> Okay. Yes. because we uh we do have IM
so it is a little bit of hearing
protection but I would love to know uh
you can you feel free to take as many
swings as you as you need but I'd love
to know uh what an 80 del uh ring sounds
like.
>> So yeah I recently I measured my ears my
left ear 64 so I have moderate mild to
moderate hearing loss really which
substantially increases your risk of
dementia.
>> Oh wow.
>> So yeah so
>> because you're going crazy because you
don't you don't perceive reality
properly.
>> Your brain's missing all these things.
Oh, that's our built for for hearing
loss like concerts, social gatherings,
restaurants. So, yeah, I would suggest
everyone get a hearing test. I just got
hearing aids.
>> Okay,
>> so all right.
>> Okay, cool.
>> Here we go.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Hit the hit that gong at at
a at a longevity approved level. Let's
hear it.
>> All right.
>> Okay. What are we at?
>> How we doing?
>> 90.
>> 90.
>> Okay. So, about that level. If we go any
higher, we're going to need
>> Just a tad.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Just a tad.
>> There we go.
>> That is the Brian Johnson approve
approved
>> hit.
>> You heard it here. I bet I bet everyone
in the chat is like, "Oh, finally."
Because we we smacked that thing so
loud. Fortunately, you know, we
>> Dude, do you have tonitis?
>> No, I don't.
>> Okay.
>> Fortunately, but I I do.
>> Oh, you do? I've had it since I was uh
my my Coachella era.
>> This is the thing.
>> Wow. So,
>> yeah. Now, I I don't I don't go to
concerts at all. I don't pay to stand in
crowds and lines. Um but uh but I do I I
I specifically recall uh or I believe I
know the exact weekend that that uh that
that uh it started.
>> Man, is it a pretty significant thing in
your life?
>> Uh no. Oh, I I zone it out. But but if I
take a if I I like I've adapted to not
hearing it. But if I every
>> probably
>> few times a week I I'll be in a really
quiet space and realize that I have
constant ringing.
>> Have you looked into hearing aids?
>> No.
>> Yeah.
>> Maybe I should.
>> Yeah. So I just got the Ottoon Intense.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. That that that increases your not
wearing them right now.
>> Not right now. Yeah.
>> But you you've been testing them out.
>> Yeah. Exactly. I actually I I'm so sad.
I I was running out the door and I
forgot them
>> cuz I just finished my morning routine.
So, I'm still sad. But yeah, but they
actually they I've only had them for a
week. They have substantially improved
my life.
>> Wow.
>> Yeah.
>> Wow. Cool.
>> Well, this conversation has
substantially improved my life
on the show. This is fantastic.
Congratulations.
