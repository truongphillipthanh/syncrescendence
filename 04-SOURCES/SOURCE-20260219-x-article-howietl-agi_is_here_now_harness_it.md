# AGI is here. Now harness it.
I've been personally burning through billions of tokens a week for the past few months as a builder. Today, I'm excited to announce Hyperagent, by Airtable.
Hyperagent gives agents a full computing environment — real browser, shell, filesystem — along with powerful tools like image and video generation, mapping, data warehouse access, and hundreds of enterprise integrations. Think OpenClaw, but secure and cloud-based from the get-go — with skill learning that compounds over time, one-click deployment into Slack, and a command center to manage your entire fleet of agents at scale.
## State-of-the-art agents with a full computing environment and powerful tools
Built to fully leverage the best frontier models, every Hyperagent session gets a full computing environment with persistent filesystem, a real browser, code execution, image/video/audio generation, data warehouse integrations + hundreds of other connectors, and the ability to learn any new API as a skill. For an interior design use case, Hyperagent can browse the web to find listing photos, pull Google Street View imagery of the exterior, then uses those actual photos as seeds to generate reimagined rooms with Nano Banana Pro and walkthrough videos with Veo 3 — and compile it all into a client-ready proposal website with a custom URL. No brittle sequence — it pieces together tools creatively, each output becoming the input to the next.

## Unlock domain expertise with skill learning
Spend a session teaching the agent how your VC firm evaluates startups — the inflection signals, the founder qualities, how you assess whether a technical moat compounds or gets commoditized. Now any partner says "pull together a view on this company" and gets your firm's thesis, not a generic template. Skills can be API integrations, domain methodologies, or operational frameworks — and they improve with every run.
(Description: Embedded video showing Hyperagent Skills interface with multiple skill cards displayed including architectural styles, comparative analysis, technical documentation, financial modeling, and user research. The dashboard shows searchable skills with imagery and categorization options. Runtime 0:22.)
## One click to deploy as intelligent coworkers for your entire org
Any workflow can be packaged into a reusable agent — custom prompt, defined tools, attached skills, model selection, and invocation settings. Then deploy your agents into Slack with one click. These aren't bots that wait to be @mentioned — they follow conversations, understand context, and act when relevant.
Now any teammate can say "this house just hit the market" and get the same high-quality output, following the best-practice steps, every time.
(Description: Embedded video showing Hyperagent interface for home listing analysis with a document titled "Home House Design Strategy Showcase." The video displays client information form, property details with listing photos, and a generated proposal page for "671 Lincoln Avenue" with property overview and analysis. Runtime 0:16.)
## A command center to oversee, optimize, and continuously improve your entire fleet
Every agent deployed across the org, in one place. Eval rubrics that define what a successful run looks like. Performance over time. Cost tracking. Auto-suggested improvements. A/B test configurations — swap models to optimize for cost or quality.
This is a system of agents that have the toolkit to do real work and get better with every run. The operating system for the age of AGI.
(Description: Embedded video showing Hyperagent Command Center dashboard. The interface displays a comprehensive agent management system with 14 total agents, 33 successful runs, and cost metrics of $9.11. Left sidebar lists agent names with status indicators (green for active, orange/red for various states). Right panel shows performance charts and metrics including successful operations, error operations, and cost tracking visualization. Runtime 0:16.)
