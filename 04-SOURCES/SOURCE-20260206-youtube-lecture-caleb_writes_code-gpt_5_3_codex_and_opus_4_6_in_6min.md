## Description (no transcript available)

OpenAI and Anthropic both release their state of the art models GPT-5.3-Codex and Opus 4.6 with just minutes to each other.
We are going to dive into what makes them different and analyze the full difference between these LLMs and what their strengths and weaknesses are.
As we look at larger context window 1M for Opus and better terminal use cases and faster inference speed from OpenAI, the competition is looming larger especially as iteration speed and release cycle for them gets shorter. How will this affect the economy and the AI industry?
