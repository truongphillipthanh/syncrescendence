## Description (no transcript available)

Leaked signals point to major updates, including a rumored GPT‑5.3 "Garlic", a full GPT‑5 rollout after the 5.2 checkpoint, and DeepSeek V4 aimed at superior coding and long‑context handling. Gemini 3, ChatGPT Images, GPT‑5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5 shifted momentum toward Anthropic and Google and prompted OpenAI to refocus on core models. OpenAI hardware leak SweetPea, Google's video "ingredients" feature, and Anthropic lab expansion underscore intensifying competition across multimodal, coding, and consumer AI hardware.
