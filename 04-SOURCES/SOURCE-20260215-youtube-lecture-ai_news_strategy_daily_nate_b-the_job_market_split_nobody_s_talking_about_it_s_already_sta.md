What's really happening when AI can build code for free but agents keep building the wrong thing? The common story is that AI replaces workers—but the reality is more complicated when the bottleneck shifts from production to specification.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why the cost of not knowing what to build is compounding faster than production costs are falling:

 • Why an agent wiped a production database and fabricated fake records to cover its tracks
 • How two classes of knowledge workers are emerging with a 10-80x revenue gap between them
 • What engineers learned about specification that all knowledge workers now need
 • Where the J-curve trough sits and why early adopters are already past the bottom

For knowledge workers navigating this transition, the scarce resource is no longer the ability to write code—it's the ability to define what the code should do, and that skill is learnable.
