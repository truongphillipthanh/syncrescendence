# Learning 2.0: the shift most people will miss

(Description: A stylized digital illustration featuring a figure in a vibrant magenta/pink hoodie seated on a rocky outcrop, holding an open laptop. The background is a swirling, cosmic-inspired pattern in black and white with spiral galaxies, stars, and planetary orbs, evoking themes of learning and discovery in a digital age.)

The way you were taught to learn is optimized for teachers, not you. And it's costing you years of wasted effort. AI removed that barrier but you're still acting like it's there.

AI has completely democratized learning. You no longer need "permission" to study something new. You need a "motivation" and the right approach to learning with AI.

## The problem we had to endure: bottom-up learning

The old method of learning forced you to spend months studying the fundamentals you were not convinced you needed. Learn mathematics before Python, Python before ML, ML before building your model. You had to pay your dues at each level before moving on to the next.

This is even worse in universities and schools, where the teachers spend literally ZERO effort to communicate why you have to spend a semester studying a subject, and a lot of times you can't blame them. There is no reason!

This bottom-up approach was necessary because learning resources by nature, assume a certain level of knowledge when they teach you anything. 10 years ago, if you'd pick up a book on Deep Learning, it assumed you knew the necessary mathematics or coding, because most books didn't want to spend time giving you everything you needed to learn X. So they left it up to you to learn A, B, C, ... before X.

This was optimized for the convenience of teachers, not the learners.

But the problem is, bottom-up learning is extremely **inefficient for the learner**: you spend months/years accumulating knowledge that you don't see a clear application for, and by the time you reach the real problems, you've forgotten half of it.

## The landscape had a massive shift

The alternative to the old way of learning is "top-down". You start with a real problem, something you're truly passionate about, you wiggle your way through it, you hit a wall, and **then and only then**, you go learn the specific foundational knowledge required to break through those walls.

This approach used to be impossible at scale. You'd need constant access to an expert who'd hold your hand, tell you what fundamentals you're missing for the problem at hand, and point you in the direction of learning it.

This was (and still to some degree is) frowned upon by academia.

That constraint is no longer there.

The expert that didn't exist is now available to everyone with a $20 subscription to ChatGPT/Claude, or Gemini. Of course, it's not perfect (I'll get to limitations), but it's good enough to fundamentally change who can learn what and how fast they can do it.

Gabriel Petersson (@gabriel1) is a perfect example of someone who figured this out and proved this is not only doable, but much more efficient:

- A high-school drop-out from a small town in Sweden
- Wanted to learn how video AI models work
- Asked ChatGPT to explain the fundamentals and write all the code for a diffusion model
- Understood nothing, so he kept asking follow-ups "what does this part do," "explain it like I'm 12," "show me graphs"
- Did this 100 times a day, recursively filling his knowledge gaps
- Over the years he mastered this so well that he was hired at OpenAI to work on Sora, doing a job that traditionally requires a PhD.

You can actually watch his entire [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq5WhoPCWQ8&list=PLNL1LpnrEjiB5cu4nK54Lvxx3OLzCTSEX&index=1) where he explained his process, which inspired me to write this article in the first place.

So if top-down learning is so effective, why isn't everyone doing it?

## The modern learning skill no one is teaching

Top-down learning requires a necessary skill: **recognizing when you don't understand something.**

It might sound trivial, but it's not.

When learning a new topic most people do one of the two things when they encounter a challenging concept, they either:

i) They pretend they understand it and move on (classic in most classrooms)
ii) They get frustrated and give up.

What almost nobody does right is to sit down comfortably with their confusion, understand what it is they don't understand, and formulate a precise question.

This is the **meta-skill of knowing what you don't know.**

**Confusion** is actually a signal that you're about to learn something new. The "AHA moment" will only happen when you sit down with the discomfort of not understanding.

This quote from Andrej Karpathy explains this beautifully.

(Description: A highlighted quote in a light background box containing Karpathy's insights on learning:

"There are a lot of videos on YouTube/TikTok etc. that give the appearance of education, but if you look closely they are really just entertainment. This is very convenient for everyone involved: the people watching enjoy thinking they are learning (but actually they are just having fun).

Learning is not supposed to be fun. The primary feeling should be that of effort. It should look a lot less like that '10 minute full body' workout from your local digital media creator and a lot more like a serious session at the gym. You want the mental equivalent of sweating.

I find it helpful to explicitly declare your intent up front as a sharp, binary variable in your mind. If you are consuming content: are you trying to be entertained or are you trying to learn? And if you are creating content: are you trying to teach? You'll go down a different path in each case. Attempts to seek the stuff in between actually clamp to zero.

So for those who actually want to learn. Unless you are trying to learn something narrow and specific, close those tabs with quick blog posts. Close those tabs of 'Learn XYZ in 10 minutes'. Consider the opportunity cost of snacking and seek the meal - the textbooks, docs, papers, manuals, longform. Allocate a 4 hour window. Don't just read, take notes, re-read, re-phrase, process, manipulate, learn.")

## YOU must stay in control, and die for it if you have to

Remember, the whole point of this process is for YOU to stay in control. You don't want another form of classic school teacher who decides what you must learn, how, and when you've learned enough.

The key is being able to extract what you want from AI. And most people are terrible at that.

AI is by nature designed to please the average. And the average don't usually stand up and decide they want to learn reinforcement learning from scratch using AI and all by themselves.

Here's the typical conversation:

**User:** Explain Reinforcement Learning in simple words.
**AI:** [Provides a generic, textbook-style explanation]

You don't want this.

Again, the point is not to replicate the old learning process. The point is to stay in control, and this is the way to do it:

**User:** I want to study Reinforcement Learning. I want you to tell me why it exists. What problem does it solve? What was the alternative approach before it? I know the agent takes actions and gets rewards in return, but I don't understand how it actually learns which actions are good. How does it know which of those 10 actions caused the reward? Walk me through the math intuitively, explain it like I'm 12, and give me a solid example.

The key is being precise and specific about what you want, not to leave it to someone else.

This is actually a skill you will perfect over time. As you do this more and more often, you get to realize what kind of questions spark the answers that make it "click for you".

## The two modes of learning

There are two modes of using AI:

1. **AI as a labor replacement** — which is what 99% of people go for. "Write me an essay on...", "do this homework...", "write me a code that..." While this may have its own benefits in its own time, but it actually makes you worse over time. Delegating the thinking, confusion, and the mental pain to AI may benefit you in the short term, but in the long run will weaken your cognitive abilities to use your working memory and reason.

2. **AI as a learning mentor.** This is what produces outlier results. The point of this mode is to compress the time between confusion and clarity.

## The recursive descent method

So enough talk. This is the practical framework of how to do this.

**Step 0: understand why the subject exists in the first place**

Before doing anything, before getting to explanations and definitions, you must truly understand the origin story of what you're learning. Let's say you're learning about RL. You must ask:

- Why does reinforcement learning exist?
- What problem does it solve?
- Where is it practically used?
- What was the alternative approach before it?

**Step 1: start with a problem not a curriculum**

Instead of asking AI for what you should learn for RL, ask it "what's a project I could build that uses RL?". Then "write the code for me."

**Step 2: try to make it work**

Run the code. Be amazed by the results. See the visualization. If it's a simple Python game that uses an RL agent, play it.

**Step 3: explain back (the Feynman technique)**

Once you start reading the code and understand the bits of it, explain each bit back to AI and ask it if your understanding is correct.

This is critical!

**Step 4: recursively descend**

After spending enough time (hours, days) perfecting your understanding with this back-and-forth conversation, ask AI: "what foundational concepts does this depend on?" and repeat the process for those.

**Step 5: Generalize**

Once you understand something deeply, ask: "what other problems does this solve? what are the limitations? what would I do differently in situation X?"

This is the step which allows you to fill in the gaps.

This process helps you build something practically, understand it deeply, and go after the fundamentals you practically need.

## What this doesn't solve

Let's be honest about the limitations here. Otherwise the "you can learn anything from AI" narrative is just as bullshit as the traditional narrative.

**AI can't give you agency**

If you need someone with a stick to force you to learn and commit to it, you need to solve a deeper, more fundamental problem with yourself than "how to learn". This framework is simply for the self-learners. If you're not that, do research on how to become one. If you're not, you're dead in tech.

**AI can't teach you taste.**

Knowing how to build a working RL agent is different from knowing which problems are worth working on, what are the bottlenecks in the field, which approaches are elegant, and which code is maintainable. These are human-specific judgments that AI isn't good at yet.

**AI can be confidently wrong.**

This is why it's necessary to augment your learning with YouTube videos, searching, reading papers, etc. In the mean time, coupling with another learner to co-study could be helpful. This is also where it's important to couple your study with real human-written resources: books, blogs, articles.

**You still need to do the work.**

Don't get me wrong. The point of skipping unnecessary fundamentals isn't to do less work, it's to direct your efforts at the right things. AI removes friction, not the work.

## The divide is coming, and it's real

Here's what I think will happen in the next 5 years. The people who train themselves to learn in the 2nd mode, **the recursive descent** will be the only people able to learn efficiently and keep up with the crazy fast pace of the evolving tech field.

The people who refuse to learn with AI, the ones who insist on the traditional approach, will slowly fade to irrelevance. Not because those methods don't work, but because they can't compete with the pace of the first group.

I often think about this tweet and you should too:
