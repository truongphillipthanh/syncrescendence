## Description (no transcript available)

Gemini 3 hype has consumed the AI community after Google and prominent figures teased an imminent model release. Berkshire Hathaway's roughly $4.9 billion Alphabet stake fueled investor debate over long-term tech exposure and AI leadership. Michael Burry's fund closure and Palantir and Nvidia shorts, alongside Sam Altman's outsized capital commitments, signal a shift from speculative frenzy to more scrutinized, fundamentals-driven AI investing.
