## Description (no transcript available)

Each one of us have made the remarkable journey from matter to mind. 
The destination is our existence, one whole conscious being.
The marvellous nature of our intelligence can be traced to the aptitude of every individual cell in our body. 
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. 
What if we could rewire the code that separates self from world? 
Tadpoles with eyes growing from their tails, worms with two heads- is the manifestation of biology governed entirely by chance?

Michael Levin is an American developmental and synthetic biologist at Tufts University, where he is the Vannevar Bush Distinguished Professor. Levin is a director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts University and Tufts Center for Regenerative and Developmental Biology. He is also co-director of the Institute for Computationally Designed Organisms with Josh Bongard.
