# Cathie Wood: Productivity-Driven Economic Boom Thesis

## Core Thesis
The US is transitioning from a three-year rolling recession into a productivity-driven recovery, catalyzed by tax policy changes (effective corporate tax dropping to 10-12%) and broad deregulation. This mirrors but could exceed the Reaganomics boom of the 80s/90s.

## Key Insights

### Economic Diagnosis
- Manufacturing negative for 3 years
- Small businesses and low/middle income consumers suffering
- Capital spending flat/declining outside AI and power

### Policy Catalysts (OB3 - July 4th Bill)
- Statutory rate remains 21%
- Effective corporate tax: ~10-12% (lowest among major economies)
- Key mechanism: Accelerated depreciation for manufacturing, equipment, R&D, software
- Deregulation mandate across healthcare, crypto, AI

### Market Predictions
**Dollar Strength (contrarian view):**
- Returns on invested capital rising relative to rest of world
- Foreign direct investment expected to increase
- Parallels to Reaganomics dollar doubling (1985)

**Gold vs Dollar:**
- If dollar becomes "as good as gold" (Art Laffer framing), gold loses appeal
- Precedent: Gold dropped $800→$300 in early 80s dollar rally

**Bitcoin Positioning:**
- "Digital gold" + first-of-kind new asset class
- Institutions just beginning to enter
- Technology component distinguishes from pure store-of-value

### Employment Nuance
- Employment is lagging indicator
- Expect more negative employment news near-term
- AI limiting opportunities especially for new graduates
- Productivity gains may not translate to job creation immediately

## Canonical Relevance
- Supports CANON-33112 Revenue Model macro environment analysis
- Informs Expertise chain market positioning
- Bitcoin thesis aligns with Information chain crypto perspective


## Transcript

Kathy Wood just went on a monologue and
she made some pretty excellent and
optimistic views on how she sees this
current market. When Kathy speaks, I
listen. Check this out. You
>> know, we've been thinking and and giving
you evidence over the last 3 years that
the US economy has been in a rolling
recession. Manufacturing negative for
three years. Small businesses suffering,
low and middle inome consumers
suffering, even capital spending. I know
the headlines are all about AI and power
needs, but X X those, we've seen a
flattening out, if not a decline, in
many capital spending sectors. So, we
now are looking at the early days of
this Trump administration. seems like a
lot of drama uh and headlines primarily
about tariffs, but underneath in terms
of real policy moves, OB3, so the one
big beautiful bill, which passed on July
4th, included some massive changes in
tax policy. I think the most important
ones involve depreciation
and they are taking the effective
corporate tax rate that the the
statutory tax rate is still 21% but
incorporating depreciation schedules the
new ones for manufacturing facilities,
equipment, domestic R&D and software.
the effective corporate tax rate has
probably dropped into the 10 to 12%
range, which makes it really the lowest
in the world for any major economy. So,
we do believe that we're moving from a
rolling recession into a rolling
recovery. It's going to take a little
time to catch fire and we think that
employment is a lagging indicator. So,
we're going to hear more bad news about
employment for both cyclical reasons and
because AI is limiting the job
opportunities for especially new college
graduates. But we do think that the tax
policy changes and critically
deregulation everywhere. The edict from
on high was deregulate, deregulate,
deregulated. And we are seeing it all
over the place, especially in healthcare
and crypto and even AI. The first
executive order that President Trump
rescended was Biden's AI executive order
because we really do believe right now
we're still in very early stages, the
equivalent of 1995
in terms of the internet. We're in early
stages as it relates to AI and there
were some ownorous regulations moving
into the policym arena. We believe we're
moving into a productivitydriven
boom in activity. I think the plan was
this to the extent President Trump and
team could control it. Get all the bad
news out early in this term and as we
move into the election campaign season
for the midterms have the economy move
into a very strong expansion. So that's
what we expect and because it's
productivity driven we believe that the
surprises
will be on the low side of inflation
expectations.
So this is very much like the economy
that regonomics unleashed in the 80s and
90s and we think that this could be a
much more powerful version of that. So,
we're very excited about the outlook for
the economy, innovation, and the markets
generally.
>> I'm going to come back with one more
just on the macro side here, too. We're
hearing a lot of talk about just US
dollar weakening and gold and Bitcoin
and how that relates, gold hitting new
highs. Can you just give us your kind of
quick take on that?
>> Yes, it's very interesting. I just took
a trip around the world actually and I
saw the negative sentiment about the US
mostly because of the headlines tariffs
they've really colored the point of view
of investors in the rest of the world
and you know I heard dollar weakness a
familiar refrain abroad first half of
the year weakest dollar since by some
metrics 1973
and I gave them the outlook book that I
just described here and actually took
the opposite point of view. I think the
dollar and this happened during
regonomics as well. I think the dollar
is going to go up and that's because I
believe given the policies that have
been put in place that the returns on
invested capital in the US are going to
go up relative to the rest of the world
and that foreign direct investment will
increase substantially
we think is is going to be a surprise.
One of the reasons gold has been going
up is this narrative. The dollar is
debasing and so that's a boon for for
gold and for bitcoin. Well, if the
dollar becomes as good as gold and this
is uh an expression that art laugher,
you've heard me talk about la art and
the laugher curve. He's also a monetary
expert and as we've been discussing this
scenario with him, he brought this
framing back which is well if the dollar
becomes as good as gold then why hold
gold? So we shall see. Gold did go down.
It peaked in the early8s, actually 1980
at $800 and went down over the next two
years to $300
with that kind of dollar strength. The
dollar strength did not end until 1985.
The dollar actually doubled from its low
to its peak in 1985, at which point the
rest of the world was suffering. There
was a huge amount of dollar denominated
debt in countries whose currencies were
depreciating rapidly. So debt service
became ownorous if not impossible. And
we ended up with a worldwide
easing effectively with the dollar
providing more dollars. I mean the US
providing more dollars into the global
ecosystem. I think we're going to be
back to the future on that as well. As
far as Bitcoin, well, Bitcoin is digital
gold, but as we've said many times, it
is also a technology and it's the first
of its kind in a new asset class. That
paper, I believe, is still on our
website. Maybe we can put it into this
webinar. First of its kind in a new
asset class, and institutions have just
started tiptoeing into it. Everyone's
freaking out about tariffs and dollar
weakness, but Kathy Wood is looking at
something completely different. The
biggest corporate tax cut in modern
history that nobody's talking about. The
effective corporate tax rate just
dropped to 10 to 12% through new
depreciation rules, making the US the
lowest tax major economy and setting up
a productivity driven boom that most
people are completely missing. Kathy
explains that while the statutory
corporation tax remains 21%, new
depreciation schedules for manufacturing
facilities, equipment, domestic R&D, and
software have dropped the effective rate
to probably around the 10 to 12% range,
making it the lowest in the world for
any major economy. Kathy says this is
combined with deregulation everywhere.
The directive was deregulate,
deregulate, deregulate, especially in
healthcare, crypto, and AI. Do you
believe we're moving from a rolling
recession into a rolling recovery? This
is maybe the most underappreciated
policy change of 2025. Everyone's
obsessing over tariff headlines while a
fundamental restructuring of corporate
taxation just happened with almost no
media coverage. The statutory rate
staying at 21% is what gets reported.
But the effective rate is what actually
matters for corporate decisions.
Depreciation schedules determine how
fast companies can write off
investments. If you can immediately
expense manufacturing facilities,
equipment, R&D, and software in year 1
instead of depreciating them over 10
over 5 to 15 years, your effective tax
rate plummets. You're getting massive
tax shields that reduce actual taxes
paid to a fraction of the statutory
rate. At 10 to 12% effective rate, the
US becomes the most attractive developed
market for corporate investment by a
huge margin. Germany's effective rate is
around 30, France 25, UK 19, Japan 30%,
and China 25. The US just became the
global tax haven for productive business
investment. This creates a compounding
effect. Lower taxation means higher
returns on invested capital. High
returns attract more capital investment.
More investment means more productivity
growth. More productivity growth means
companies can grow revenue without
proportional headcount increases. That's
how you get sustained economic expansion
without triggering inflation.
Productivity gains offset wage
increases. Kathy makes an interesting
comparison to regonomics. The 1980s tax
cuts and deregulation unleashed a two
decade boom, but Reagan's corporate tax
cuts were modest compared to this,
dropping from 46% to 34%. Going from an
effective 21 to 10 to 12% is a much
larger relative change. But the economic
implications go way beyond just growth.
They completely flipped the conventional
wisdom about the dollar. The dollar is
likely to strengthen significantly, not
weaken, because higher returns on US
capital will drive massive foreign
direct investment. Exactly like what
happened during Reegonomics when the
dollar doubled. Everyone's worried about
dollar debasement from deficits and
tariffs disrupting trade. But Kathy's
looking at capital flows, not trade
flows. And capital flows are what
actually determine currency strength
over time. The mechanism is
straightforward. If US effective
corporate tax rates are 10 to 12% whilst
Europe is 25 to 30%, where would you
invest $100 million building a new
factory? The after tax returns in the US
are dramatically higher. That preference
drives foreign direct investment which
requires buying dollars to make those
investments. Higher demand for dollars
makes the dollar stronger. The Bitcoin
angle is interesting because Cathy
acknowledges it both as digital gold. It
competes with physical gold. If the
dollar strengthens significantly, both
could face headwinds. But as a
technology and new asset class, Bitcoin
has different drivers. Institutional
adoption, technological improvement, and
network effects. Those factors might
offset currency strength impacts. But
there's also something else at play
here. Lower effective corporation tax
rates accelerate investment into
innovation, meaning Cathy's bullish
timelines for technology like AI,
robots, and autonomy might actually
happen faster than she originally
predicted. Kathy has been consistently
bullish on disruptive innovation for
years, but she's always been constrained
by how fast companies could actually
deploy capital into those technologies.
High corporate taxes mean companies had
less cash to reinvest. Slow regulatory
approval meant projects took years
longer than necessary. Both factors
extended her timelines. Now both
constraints just lifted simultaneously.
Companies can immediately expense all
their R&D and equipment spending, which
means every dollar invested generates
massive tax shields. A company spending
$1 billion on AI infrastructure
previously paid taxes on profits before
investing. Now they can expense that $1
billion immediately reducing their tax
bill by1 to $200 million depending on
the structure. That's$1 to $200 million
more capital to invest into the next
round of innovation. This creates a
feedback loop for Cathy's investment
thesis. She's been betting on
exponential technology curves in
genomics, AI, robotics, energy storage,
and blockchain. She's been betting on
those curves always going to happen
eventually, but the speed at which they
happen depends on capital availability
and regulatory friction. Both just
improve dramatically. We don't have
crazy perks yet, but if you believe in
what we're doing and want to help us
keep going, joining as a member really
helps make a difference. Every bit of
support really helps. Thank you.
