## Description (no transcript available)

Deedy Das, Partner at Menlo Ventures, returns to Latent Space to discuss his journey from Glean to venture capital, the explosive rise of Anthropic, and how AI is reshaping enterprise software and coding. From investing in Anthropic early on when they had no revenue to managing the $100M Anthology Fund, Das shares insider perspectives on the fastest-growing software company in history and what's next for AI infrastructure, research investing, and the future of engineering.

We cover Glean’s rise from “boring” enterprise search to a $7B AI-native company, Anthropic's meteoric rise, the strategic decisions behind products like Claude Code, and why market share in enterprise AI is shifting dramatically. Das explains his investment thesis on research companies like Goodfire, Prime Intellect, and OpenRouter and how the Anthology Fund is quietly seeding the next wave of AI infra, research, and devtools.
