# Claude Code's MCP Problem Just Got Fixed

## Description (no transcript available)

Anthropic just fixed the biggest issue with using MCP servers with Claude Code. Connecting MCP servers directly to Claude Code was the fastest way to consume the entire context window, degrading Claude Code's performance and leaving less space for working conversation. In this video, I'm going to break down everything you need to know about the new MCP Search Tool that allows Claude Code to efficiently discover and use MCP tools without pre-loading all of the MCP tool definitions into the context window, saving you 10s of thousands of tokens!

**NOTE**: I made a mistake in the CC version, the MCP Search Tool was released with v2.1.9 not v2.1.7! See the full change log here: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md
