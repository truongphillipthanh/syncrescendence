# GOOGLE AI ECOSYSTEM: DEEP RESEARCH PROMPT
## Platform Capability Catalog + Agentic Architecture Analysis

**Research Objective**: Comprehensive investigation of Google's AI product ecosystem for multi-platform constellation integration

---

## RESEARCH CONTEXT

This research supports a **5-platform AI constellation** architecture:
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Primary execution engine via Claude Code (3 Pro accounts)
- **OpenAI**: Complementary capabilities (ChatGPT Plus)
- **Google**: Extensive ecosystem integration (Gemini Advanced via sinclairtarget@gmail.com)

**Design Philosophy**: Google's unique value is **ecosystem breadth**. Unlike Anthropic (depth in agentic coding) or OpenAI (media generation + reasoning models), Google offers integration across YouTube, Scholar, Workspace, NotebookLM, and emerging agentic tools (Jules, Antigravity, Gemini CLI).

**Benchmark**: Our Claude Code research produced 845 lines of synthesized intelligence. This Google research should achieve equivalent depth while covering the much broader surface area.

## META-INSTRUCTION

Google's value proposition is **ecosystem breadth and integration**. Focus on:

1. **Mapping the full landscape** - Google's AI is fragmented across many products
2. **Clarifying tier gating** - What's actually available at Advanced ($20)?
3. **Identifying unique capabilities** - NotebookLM, Workspace, YouTube integration
4. **Integration patterns** - How Google feeds into Claude Code workflows

The ideal output enables:
- Clear understanding of what we have access to
- Identification of underutilized capabilities
- Integration architecture for the constellation
- Decision framework for tier/product choices
