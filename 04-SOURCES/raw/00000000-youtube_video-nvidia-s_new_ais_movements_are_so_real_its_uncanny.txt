There is one thing that I really want. What I  want is a digital character to move exactly like a  
0:07
human. Well, just copy it then, right? Do a little  motion capture with the sensors on the human body,  
0:13
record it running, jumping, reading papers, and  then, copy it within a computer program. Well,  
0:20
unfortunately, that is impossible. Okay, why?  Well, this motion capture data shows you what  
0:27
you need to do, but it does not tell you  how. You see, these virtual characters  
0:33
have muscles and joints, and to copy these  movements, you would need to come up with  
0:38
the forces and torques exerted everywhere at  every time instance to be able to mimic it.
0:45
Oh man, that is hard. Really hard.
0:48
But, this amazing paper from 2018 could  already do that. It was called DeepMimic,  
0:55
and goodness, this…am I seeing correctly? This  really is able to match the reference motions  
1:03
superbly. Is that a word? I don’t know.  I don’t care. We talked about this work  
1:08
approximately 500 videos ago. Yes I heard you. I  heard what you just said. And the answer is yes,  
1:15
we’ve been around that long.  Almost a 1,000 paper videos now.
1:20
Okay, DeepMimic. This worked by turning motion  imitation into a video game where every joint,  
1:27
angle, and contact had its own little  score counter. The controller played  
1:33
this game over and over, tweaking  its moves through endless retries,  
1:37
until it learned how to rack up the  maximum score. Which is perfect imitation  
1:43
of the motion capture performance. And  boy, does it look perfect in places.
1:49
But it got better, it worked on a bunch of  different body morphologies as well. And you  
1:55
could even do the favorite pastime of the computer  graphics researcher: throwing boxes at it, for how  
2:04
long? Until it collapses of course. You could even  do some art direction where you would ask it to  
2:11
dance a bit more vigorously. Yes, more life, more  life, more energy! Oh baby. It looks terrible but  
2:19
I still love it. And now, you’re tired after doing  all this kung fu. Yup, that one checks out too.
2:27
So, is this work perfect? It sure seems so! Well,  
2:31
it is not. Here is a dirty little  secret, but don’t tell anyone.
2:36
So here’s the problem: every single one of  those little score counters in DeepMimic  
2:41
had to be designed and tuned by hand. You had  to decide exactly how many points to give for  
2:49
matching a knee angle, how harshly to punish a  wobbly torso, and how much to care about foot  
2:55
placement versus balance. Change the motion,  or even switch to a robot body, and suddenly  
3:02
all your scores are wrong again. You spend days  turning invisible dials just to get something  
3:09
that doesn’t collapse into a breakdancing  mess. Just to get a flavor of the paper,  
3:15
you have to optimize these: joint rotations,  velocities, root velocity, end effectors that  
3:21
describe where hands and feet should go, and  center of mass. Yum yum yum. Tastes great,  
3:28
but man, that’s a lot to optimize. And you have  to do it by hand, manually? Oof. This system is  
3:35
held together by duct tape and the tears of  PhD students. There’s got to be a better way!
3:43
And that’s where this new paper, ADD, the  Adversarial Differential Discriminator comes  
3:49
in. Instead of hard-coding hundreds of score  counters, it introduces an AI judge that learns  
3:56
automatically what a perfect performance looks  like. The system plays the same imitation game,  
4:02
but now, instead of manually juggling  separate scores for elbows, knees,  
4:08
and toes, the judge gives a single  verdict on how close the motion feels  
4:12
to the real human one. As training  goes on, this judge gets smarter,  
4:18
focusing attention on the parts that still look  off and pushing the character to refine them.
4:24
So, previous DeepMimic lots of hand-tuning,  new ADD, single automatic AI judge.
4:31
Okay, good. But that does help? Hmm… they say  this is better than DeepMimic? Well, I’d like  
4:39
to see that! And, well well well. I am not seeing  that. With pink, we got DeepMimic, the previous  
4:48
method and with blue, ADD, the new technique. Both  are nailing the problem, but it’s not better. So,  
4:56
have we been deceived by the marketing department  again? I swear I’m not buying more car insurance.
5:03
Okay, let’s calm down and see if this next test  is better. Here is the reference movement. A  
5:12
little parkour! Loving it. So, the previous AMP  method does exactly what we all feel like at the  
5:19
moment. Disqualified. Get out of here. And now,  DeepMimic is about to nail it, as always. Wait a  
5:27
second…that’s not it, sir. You need a little  more carbohydrates before working out! Wow,  
5:34
it failed. And if you think this is a failure  case, now check this out. Now off with you,  
5:41
eat a nutrition bar while we watch the reference  motion do the jump. Okay, got it? Got it. So now,  
5:48
start running, and…oof! Sir. Sir! Are you  okay? Goodness, failed again, even worse.
5:57
Now hold on to your papers Fellow  Scholars and let’s see if the new  
6:01
technique with the AI judge is any  better, and…oh my goodness. They did  
6:08
it. What about the climbing? Let’s  see…absolutely nailed that too. Wow!
6:15
The motions are really fluid and believable,  
6:18
and physically correct. It controls all  the joints correctly. That is really tough.
6:25
And yes, I know what you want. You also want to  see the earlier low energy AMP do the jump too.  
6:33
Your wish is now granted. Ain’t no jumping  here brother. They don’t pay me enough. And  
6:40
believe it or not, it’s going to get even  better. Here’s how. Dear Fellow Scholars,  
6:45
this is Two Minute Papers with Dr.  Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. Dr. Carroll.
6:49
Oh yeah! We still retain DeepMimic’s wonderful  
6:53
property of working on different body  morphologies. I am starting to flip out.
7:00
So, the crowd favorite, the walking sausage man,  not a problem. ADD does as well as hand-tuned  
7:07
techniques, but this one works automatically. It  can control a robot too, it can fall and get up.
7:14
It can do a variety of different behaviors,  karate, jumping on one leg, walking an invisible  
7:22
dog. And at this point, I am so happy, this  is basically me. So good! Mother of Papers.
7:29
Here we also have an ablation study,  which takes out each individual puzzle  
7:34
piece that they invented, and they show  how the system breaks when you remove  
7:39
these individual puzzle pieces. In short,  they show one by one that everything they  
7:45
invented here is indeed useful. Not just  a soup of stuff that works, but they show  
7:51
that each piece is necessary. I still can’t  believe that they’ve actually done it. Wow!
7:58
And now, before I tell you about  the limitations of this new method,  
8:03
look at this. Oh my goodness. Is this  for real? This research paper is an  
8:09
absolutely marvelous piece of work, and  nearly nobody is talking about it. Wait a  
8:15
minute. Not nearly nobody. Actually nobody  is talking about it. Let me try to help.
8:21
So this is why I feel that talking about  these research works is so important,  
8:26
it’s a bit like saving endangered species. If we  don’t do it here, nobody does it. So please, save  
8:33
a paper today, like this video, subscribe, hit  the bell icon, and leave a really kind comment.
8:40
Okay, so it’s not flawless, of course.  Sometimes the AI judge gets confused on  
8:46
the flashier tricks - instead of pulling off a  smooth backflip, the poor thing just lies down  
8:52
and gives up halfway. It’s a bit like a dance  judge who judges the waltz well but freezes  
8:59
when the performer suddenly tries parkour  - you know, still learning what “graceful”  
9:04
means when gravity is involved. Reminds  me of an earlier paper where an AI player  
9:09
collapsed, get this, in a way that reprogrammed  the mind of the other AI to lose. Insanity.
9:17
But just think about it. AI systems  now don’t just imitate motion,  
9:22
they actually understand how we move around.  And just two more papers down the line,  
9:27
and I am sure these digital creatures  will learn to move with the same grace  
9:32
and intent as living ones. That is the First  Law of Papers. Do not look at where we are,  
9:39
look at where we will be two more papers  down the line. What a time to be alive!
9:44
