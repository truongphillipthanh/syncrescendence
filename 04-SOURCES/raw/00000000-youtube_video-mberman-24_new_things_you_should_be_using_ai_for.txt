Comparing Products
0:00
You probably haven't heard of these AI
0:02
use cases that I'm about to show you.
0:04
First, let's start with shopping and
0:06
deals. These are use cases that I have
0:08
actually been using. Let's say you're
0:10
very familiar with one product and you
0:12
need to find something that's comparable
0:14
and to compare them. This happened to
0:16
me. I have had a Dyson vacuum that has
0:20
been broken for years. So, I wanted
0:23
something else. I wanted a comparable
0:25
vacuum from a different brand. So, here
0:28
we go. What's a comparable vacuum to
0:30
Dyson cordless? Short, simple, and look
0:33
what it gave me. So, what to look for?
0:36
Battery runtime, suction power, and
0:38
floorhead compatibility, filtration,
0:40
weight, versatility, and it gave me some
0:43
options. These Shark vacuums, these are
0:46
cordless, they look almost identical,
0:48
and it says the Shark brand are higher
0:50
quality. Here, it gives me a breakdown
0:53
of why I should choose Shark or these
0:55
other options over those Dyson vacuums.
0:58
It asked me some follow-up questions. If
1:00
you tell me your budget and main
1:01
flooring type, I can pick one to two
1:03
best fits for you. And I just said the
1:05
Dyson broke all the time. And so, it
1:07
focused on product quality. So, it told
1:10
me Shark, Stratos, cordless, and I ended
1:14
up getting the corded version, but I got
1:16
a Shark. And by the way, if you want 100
1:19
more use cases for artificial
1:21
intelligence, you need to download our
1:23
brand new guide, 100 use cases for AI.
1:27
It is completely free. All you need to
1:29
do is subscribe to our newsletter. I
1:31
will drop the link down below. Go get it
1:33
right now for free. Next, one of the
Buying Products
1:35
most frustrating things is buying an
1:38
Apple product and then a week later the
1:41
new refresh comes out and you're kind of
1:43
just out of luck. The best time to buy
1:45
any product is when the most recent
1:48
refresh occurs. And that is especially
1:50
true with Apple. So, you simply ask it,
1:52
"Hey, I'm on the market for a MacBook
1:55
Air, and I want to know what's the best
1:57
time to buy. When was the last Air model
2:00
released? How big a step increase was it
2:02
from the last generation? When do you
2:04
expect another new model? And when will
2:06
it be released?" There used to be entire
2:08
websites dedicated to knowing when to
2:11
buy Apple products. And by the way, this
2:13
doesn't just apply to Apple. This can
2:15
apply to any company, especially ones
2:18
that have very frequent releases. Here,
2:20
it asks me to clarify which air size am
2:23
I interested in and what chip am I
2:25
interested in. But again, what I really
2:26
want to know is when's the best time to
2:28
buy the latest version. So, it gives me
2:30
an entire breakdown of the differences,
2:32
the changes. I don't really want to read
2:34
through this. I just want it to tell me,
2:36
is it a good time to buy? And at the
2:38
very bottom, for the buyer who
2:39
prioritizes getting the newest Apple
2:41
Silicon in the MacBook Air, you should
2:43
purchase it right after the chip update.
2:45
Given the March 2025 M4 release and its
2:48
clear advantages over the previous
2:50
generations, now is an excellent time to
2:52
buy. And it even gives me its update
2:54
schedule. So, Apple typically updates
2:56
the MacBook Air roughly once per year.
2:59
The M2 was July 2022, M3 March 2024, and
3:04
M4 March 2025. So, the best time to
3:07
purchase right now. And you can also ask
Deals & Discounts
3:10
it about discounts or special deals that
3:12
they have. So, here's one for an
3:14
Aventonin, which is an electric bike.
3:16
Chances that Aventonin will put the new
3:18
Aventon Abound SR on sale for Black
3:21
Friday this year. And it said, "Short
3:23
answer, moderate to low chance gets a
3:26
real Black Friday price cut. My best
3:28
estimate is 55 to 60% no discount, 30 to
3:33
35% small cut and 5 to 10% meaningful
3:36
promo and it of course backs it up with
3:39
information that it researched itself.
Tech Support
3:41
Now let's move on to the category food
3:43
and home. First is tech support. This is
3:46
something that I use AI for all the
3:49
time. So in this example, I didn't even
3:51
take a picture. We have an Epson NX127,
3:54
which is a printer. power and ink lights
3:57
won't stop flashing. So, it looked up
4:00
the information, looked up the manual,
4:01
and here we go. Ink cartridge
4:03
recognition failure. One or more
4:05
cartridges may not be seated correctly.
4:08
Here, we continue to work back and forth
4:10
with AI. I reinserted the cartridges,
4:12
and now both lights are solid. Solid
4:14
power and ink lights on means it's stuck
4:17
on an ink related error. And so, we went
4:20
back and forth a number of times,
4:21
ultimately solving the problem. Here's
4:23
another example. My Apple TV keeps
4:26
saying no signal after 5 minutes of
4:28
watching. Common causes and fixes. HDMI
4:31
handshake issue. Try a different HDMI
4:34
port or cable. This is the first
4:36
suggestion it gave me. I tried a new
4:37
HDMI cord and it fixed it. So easy. All
Recipes
4:41
right. Recipes is a very popular use
4:44
case for AI. And one thing that I use it
4:46
for is if I have a recipe and I don't
4:49
have one item, I simply tell AI which
4:52
items I'm missing and then ask what are
4:55
good substitutions for it. So let me
4:57
show you. Give me a recipe for salsa. So
5:00
fresh salsa pico deayo. Here's the
5:02
recipe. And let's say you don't have one
5:04
of these things. You can simply tell it
5:06
I don't have this ingredient. Give me a
5:07
replacement. Or you can even take a
5:09
picture of your fridge or your cabinet,
5:12
upload it, and say, "I don't have this
5:13
ingredient, but what else from what you
5:15
see can be substituted?" So, I said, "I
5:18
don't have white onions, only yellow.
5:20
Will that work?" Yes, yellow onions will
5:22
work fine. They're a bit sweeter, so
5:24
chop them finely and add a touch more
5:27
lime or salt to balance. So, you can
5:29
really use it as a chef partner while
Insect Identification
5:32
you're cooking. All right. And next is
5:34
animal identification. So, this is
5:36
actually one that I just used the other
5:38
day. I just moved into my house and I
5:41
found these gross little bugs on the
5:44
floor in a few different places in my
5:45
house. So, I took a picture. Here's what
5:47
that looks like. And I said, "What bug
5:49
is this?" And that's a termite aotti.
5:52
These appear during swarming season,
5:54
usually after rain or in warm weather.
5:57
Now, as soon as I heard termite, I got
6:00
very worried. But it did say it occurs
6:02
after rain, and it did just rain, so
Sponsor
6:05
it's okay. And quickly, you can run most
6:08
of these use cases locally on your
6:10
computer. Let me tell you about it.
6:13
Thank you to Dell Technologies for
6:14
sponsoring this portion of the video.
6:17
Dell's ProMax family of PCs are
6:20
incredibly powerful for AI workloads.
6:23
using the new Grace Blackwell series of
6:25
Nvidia GPUs, including GB300 and GB10.
6:30
These are absolute monster GPUs in your
6:33
desktop. Learn more about DellPro Max
6:36
GB10 and GB300 and the Dell Pro Max
6:39
lineup of workstations with Nvidia RTX
6:42
Pro GPUs. Click the link in the
6:45
description below. Let them know I sent
Finding an Office Space
6:47
you. Check it out. The next category is
6:49
productivity and organization. Let's get
6:52
into it. As many of you probably know, I
6:55
moved back to the Bay Area to be closer
6:57
to tech and the AI industry. And as part
7:00
of that, we want to build out a studio
7:03
in San Francisco. And I'm starting to do
7:05
some research on office leases and
7:08
pricing. And of course, what a great use
7:10
case for AI. So, I took a specific
7:13
building that I liked and I said, how
7:15
much is 86 Graham Street, sweet 120
7:17
leasing price, Prescidio, San Francisco?
7:20
Now, the pricing was not published
7:23
publicly. You actually have to call and
7:25
it knew that, but it asked me if I
7:27
wanted to pull comps, which are
7:28
comparable. So, what are the prices of
7:30
buildings that have been leased out in
7:32
the area over the last 6 months, let's
7:34
say? So, we pulled comps, and it gave me
7:37
a bunch of options showing how much it
7:39
is per square foot per year in different
7:42
areas. Here, I asked for another
7:44
specific address. Then I said, "Okay,
7:46
give me the average price per square
7:48
foot in different areas of San Francisco
7:50
for office leasing." So here's the
7:51
peninsula financial district, class B SF
7:54
average, class A SF average, and overall
7:57
asking price average. So this is a great
8:00
way to do deep research on real estate,
8:03
not only for leasing office space, but
8:05
also if you're renting your house, if
8:07
you're buying a house, this is a
8:10
fantastic way to get a sense of the
Creating Documents
8:12
market. All right, next. Let's say you
8:14
do a lot of the same work in a document
8:16
each week, which we do at Forward
8:19
Future. We prepare a document for every
8:21
live show we do. By the way, live show
8:23
every Friday, 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.
8:25
Pacific. Definitely check it out. Now,
8:27
for that live show, we have this
8:29
document, and we've done it every single
8:31
week, and it's kind of repetitive and
8:33
kind of timeconuming to create this
8:35
document each time. So, watch what we
8:37
can do instead. So, in Gemini, we're
8:39
going to add from Google Drive. you find
8:42
the documents. We can select a few of
8:44
them. Then we're going to hit insert.
8:47
And now we're going to tell it to create
8:49
kind of a template for going forward. So
8:52
here are three similarly formatted
8:54
documents where I track work we do to
8:57
prepare for live shows. I want to create
8:58
a new version formatted around a new
9:00
approach. Please make the new version
9:02
only cover these sections as we prepare
9:05
for future shows. So in this example,
9:07
we're taking our previous work and we're
9:09
modifying the template for future
9:11
documents. And at the end, we get it. We
9:15
have it based on the previous documents
9:17
with those changes that we just
9:18
suggested. Another thing I've been doing
Talk to your Calendar
9:21
a ton of recently is using chatpt to
9:25
negotiate with my calendar. That
9:27
sometimes means adding things to my
9:28
calendar, other times it means asking
9:30
about my availability. Watch this use
9:32
case and then let me show you one more
9:33
right after that is incredible. So,
9:35
please add two 1-hour chunks, one in the
9:37
morning, one in the afternoon, that fit
9:38
my calendar availability for me to have
9:40
heads down work time. Add to Google Cal
9:43
or give me links to add events. Now, you
9:46
can set up a chatbt connector directly
9:48
to your Google calendar. But sometimes
9:51
it doesn't work. Sometimes, even though
9:53
you say, "Hey, add this to my calendar,"
9:55
it says, "Well, I don't have a
9:56
connection to it." Even though you do.
9:58
So, the workaround to that is to simply
10:00
have it create you a link with all the
10:03
relevant information about the event you
10:05
want to create and then it'll just tell
10:06
you to click on it, which is what we see
10:08
here. So, you're busy for the live show
10:11
walkthrough. Here are two times that
10:12
you're available. And then we can simply
10:14
click on these links which add the event
10:16
directly to my calendar. All right.
Book an Airbnb
10:18
Next, in Claude, you can connect to
10:20
Airbnb and actually search for your next
10:23
trip with Airbnb through Claude. So,
10:27
find five options for Airbnbs in Hawaii
10:29
the first week of January starting
10:31
January 2nd. I would like options that
10:33
are modestly priced are super hosts,
10:35
have on-site parking, and it would be
10:37
great if they have views of the ocean,
10:39
and not be too far from the beach.
10:41
Please use the Airbnb connector. And it
10:44
does. So, here it found some options,
10:47
gave me the prices, gave me the stars,
10:49
and then it gave me its top
10:50
recommendation. Now I can continue going
10:52
back and forth refining my search with
10:54
Claude instead of having to go through
10:57
the very manual search process on
10:59
Airbnb. It's kind of like having a
11:01
little travel booking assistant. And
Google Maps
11:03
here's another incredible use case. I'm
11:05
sure most of you have used Google Maps
11:07
before and it's great. You can search
11:09
for restaurants. You can search for
11:11
other locations. You can get directions.
11:13
But what if you can go a little bit
11:14
further? So here, show me a route from
11:17
SF to Oakland. Totally normal stuff you
11:20
could do with regular Google Maps. But
11:22
now with Gemini plus Google Maps, look
Finding a Restaurant
11:26
what we can do. I need to find a good
11:28
Thai restaurant near my destination that
11:30
isn't too noisy. Can you do some
11:31
research, make some suggestions, and
11:33
plot the options on a map? So, it found
11:35
the restaurants, gave me an atmosphere,
11:38
rating, address, website, a bunch of
11:40
different pictures from each of them,
11:42
showed me where it is in an actual
11:44
interactive map, and then you could say,
11:46
"Okay, then put together the route or,
11:48
oh, I need to be at this other location.
11:50
Am I going to have enough time?" And
11:51
it's basically a really nice way to have
11:53
a natural language conversation with
11:56
your map. All right. Next, you can
Spotify
11:59
connect Spotify to Claude. And you can
12:02
control Spotify with Claude. So whether
12:05
that means just in natural language
12:07
asking it to skip a song, which is
12:08
obviously very easy, but you can also
12:11
ask it to put together different
12:13
playlists for you depending on your
12:14
mood, depending on what kind of party
12:16
you're having. So next Spotify song,
12:18
please hit enter. It's thinking.
12:21
Obviously, it's much faster just to hit
12:24
next track in whatever Spotify app
12:26
you're using, but it's cool to know you
12:28
can do this. You can also give it kind
12:30
of rough suggestions of what kind of
12:33
music you want to hear. So maybe
12:35
something more lowfi, better for morning
12:37
work. So it's going to research what
12:39
type of music fit that filter. And so
12:42
here we go. We can actually see the
12:43
connector at work. It's saying, "Okay,
12:45
play this playlist." You can deny,
12:47
always allow, or allow once, and it just
12:50
starts playing what you want. All right,
Sora
12:52
next. Sora has been out for a couple
12:54
weeks now. Hopefully you've played
12:55
around with it, by the way. It is
12:56
awesome. And you can use my likeness in
12:58
Sora. So go ahead, have fun with it. But
13:00
if you want to know how to get the most
13:01
out of Sora, we actually asked ChatGpt,
13:04
"What are the best practices for getting
13:06
the most out of Sora?" It did deep
13:08
research. It put that all together for
13:10
me. Really cool. But that's not all.
13:12
What we actually were able to do with it
13:14
is create a GPT, a custom GPT, which is
13:17
essentially a reusable chat GPT that
13:20
always has context of what we gave it.
13:22
And in this example, it is a Sora
13:25
prompting GPT. So, all you have to do is
13:28
give this GPT a very rough description
13:32
of what you want to create in Sora and
13:34
it will draft the perfect prompt for
13:36
you. So, here's an example. I want to
13:38
make a prompt of Matthew Bur and Jonah
13:40
Lipit dancing in a field giggling with
13:43
balloons. And there we go. So, it
13:45
includes everything we need to create
13:48
the perfect prompt for Sora. And if you
13:50
want to know what that looks like,
13:53
here it is. Now, if you notice here, it
13:56
says www.forwardfuture.ai.
13:58
By the way, that's our newsletter. If
14:00
you haven't checked it out, please do.
14:01
It is amazing. Keep up to date with all
14:04
the latest news in the AI industry. But
14:07
there's a reason it says that there and
14:09
I'm going to show you that next. So,
Free Advertising
14:11
what you can actually do in Sora is kind
14:14
of get free advertising. And the way to
14:16
do that is to control how your likeness
14:19
is used by others. Now, I simply said
14:22
promote forward future.ai
14:24
somewhere in the video, and that's what
14:26
you're seeing. And actually, Mark Cuban
14:28
was the first one to do this. Anytime
14:30
somebody uses likeness, it would say
14:32
something about cost plus drugs, his
14:34
company, somewhere on the screen. Kind
14:36
of a fun way to not only let people use
14:38
your likeness, but also get something
Dream Home
14:40
out of it. All right, this next example
14:42
is really cool. If you've ever wanted to
14:45
try to envision what your dream house
14:47
might look like, there are multiple
14:50
steps in creating really cool kind of
14:53
vision boards and videos of what that
14:55
would be. So, this is Gemini. We're
14:58
using Nano Banana Prompt, a breathtaking
15:00
modern dream home perched on a rugged
15:02
seaside cliff at golden hour, vast
15:05
panoramic ocean views, and so on. And
15:08
here is the first image. It created an
15:10
absolutely gorgeous house. Then I said,
15:13
"Show me the view directly out of the
15:14
window from the living room." So, same
15:16
house, just a different view. What about
15:19
the kitchen here? That is. Is there a
15:21
front yard? Sure. Main bedroom, main
15:24
bathroom, downstairs vault where I store
15:27
my Smurfs. Yes. And that's really cool.
Flow
15:31
But what if we wanted to turn it into a
15:33
real estate video showing off that
15:35
property? Well, of course, we can do
15:37
that. So, in Google's flow feature,
15:39
which basically takes VO videos and ties
15:41
them together, so it's kind of a longer
15:43
video with natural cuts, and it's really
15:45
neat if you haven't used it. So, I take
15:47
the original prompt, I say no voice over
15:50
at the end, I set the aspect ratio, the
15:53
outputs per prompt, and the model V3.1.
15:56
And finally, I upload all of those
15:58
images that I just created. And the
16:00
result, well, let me show you. There's
16:02
some music and some sound effects in the
16:04
background, but I'm not going to play
16:05
it. But we have this beautiful house and
16:07
we get to see it from different angles,
16:09
from different rooms. Obviously, there's
16:11
still a little bit of issues with
16:13
morphing and stuff like that. But I
16:15
think this looks great and it's a great
16:16
way to envision your dream house. All
Aging App
16:18
right, next. Here's one that's kind of
16:20
just for fun. You can see what you would
16:22
look like at any age. So, here I
16:25
uploaded a headsh shot of myself. Make
16:26
me an image of this man as a young
16:29
child. And there I go. Although I had
16:31
straight blonde hair, believe it or not.
16:33
Then I said, "Make me an image of this
16:35
man as a 99year-old." And here we go.
16:39
That's what that looks like. So try to
16:41
imagine yourself at any age. Quick fun
Gemini Co-Drawing
16:43
one. Now, here's another fun one that
16:45
you can do with Google AI Studio. This
16:47
is called Gemini Co-drawing, and I'll
16:49
drop a link to it down below. So you
16:52
just start drawing like you would
16:53
Microsoft Paint, and you can actually
16:55
have it clean up your drawing, add
16:57
things to your drawing, all while you
16:59
are doing the drawing yourself. So here,
17:01
make the head more circular and add
17:04
ears. And there we go. Then I'm going to
17:06
continue drawing the stick figure, but I
17:09
want it to be a little bit nicer than a
17:10
stick figure. I simply tell it what I
17:13
want and it will do that. So make the
17:15
hands and feet look more like hands and
17:17
feet. Let's see what it does. And of
17:19
course, it is following the style that
17:21
it's starting with. And there we go. So
17:23
have fun with code drawing in Google AI
Tweet Analysis
17:25
Studio. All right. And if you've not
17:27
used Grock, you should definitely use
17:29
it. is the only model that has direct
17:32
unfiltered access to the X feed and with
17:36
that you can do some incredible analysis
17:39
of different trending topics. So please
17:42
conduct some tweet trend analysis from
17:44
last six months compared to previous six
17:46
months regarding mentions of quantum
17:48
computing breakthroughs include a graph
17:50
and list of tweet examples. So, it did a
17:53
ton of research, included different
17:56
posts from different times on different
17:59
themes and how those themes trend over
18:01
time, and it pulled out example tweets,
18:03
and it did some sentiment analysis right
18:05
there. So, great way to do research on
18:08
whatever topic you want, whether for
18:09
work or personal. And Google Notebook LM
NotebookLM
18:13
came out with a really cool feature that
18:16
lets you animate a picture book based on
18:18
any topic that you want. If you're not
18:20
already familiar with Notebook LM, it
18:21
allows you to upload any documents,
18:23
PDFs, books, articles, anything. And
18:26
Notebook LM will create an audio podcast
18:29
with two people discussing whatever
18:31
topic that you want to learn about. So
18:33
here I'm taking a very complicated
18:36
research paper about OCR. I uploaded it.
18:39
Then I'm going to go down and we can
18:41
actually create a video overview. So we
18:44
select our style. We also explicitly say
18:46
what we want the AI hosts to focus on.
18:49
And here's the output. Let me show you.
18:51
Have you ever felt like you're in a
18:52
fight with your computer just trying to
18:54
get it to understand a simple document?
18:56
I mean, we've all been there. Well, what
18:58
if I told you there's a new technology
18:59
that's teaching computers to read not
19:01
just the words, but the actual meaning
19:03
and structure behind them. Today, we're
19:06
going to dive into a genuinely smarter
19:08
way for
19:08
So, I'm going to pause it. This is a 6
19:09
and 1/2 minute video with different
19:11
visuals along the way, and you can
19:13
either listen to it as an audio only or
19:16
watch the images along the way. So, I
19:18
think this is really cool. If you want
19:20
to see this example, I'll also drop the
Video Breakdowns
19:21
link to it down below. All right. Next,
19:23
you can get explanations of what a video
19:26
is about. And by the way, this is done
19:28
with chatbt atlas and agent mode. So,
19:31
you do need a paid account just for this
19:32
use case. But I'll show you another
19:34
option where you don't. But watch this.
19:36
We give it a video and we say, "Please
19:38
watch this movie and find moments in
19:40
which Sam Alman laughs or looks like he
19:41
is about to laugh. Give me a list." So
19:43
if I click into it, we can actually see
19:47
Chad GPT atlas working and watching
19:50
through the video. So this is what it
19:52
actually did. And they actually pulled
19:55
out the timestamps of when he laughed or
Video Breakdowns (Free)
19:57
was about to laugh. Now, the other AI
20:00
that is free and can kind of do
20:02
something very similar is Gemini. Gemini
20:05
is really the only model that I've seen
20:07
where you can actually upload full
20:08
videos and it will watch the video. It's
20:11
not looking at the transcript. It's not
20:13
looking at frames kind of interspersed
20:16
throughout the video. It is actually
20:17
watching it frame by frame through the
20:19
whole video. So in Google AI Studio, you
20:22
come in, you make sure you have Gemini
20:24
2.5 Pro selected. You come down here,
20:27
you paste in the video, and as you can
20:29
see, it immediately loads it up, starts
20:31
extracting the videos, and since we have
20:34
such a large context window to work
20:35
with, I believe we can have up to a 30
20:37
minute or 40-minute video. This video of
20:40
mine was 347,000 tokens out of a million
20:44
context budget that we have. And we can
20:45
ask any questions to it. So I can say,
20:48
what color sweater is the host wearing?
20:50
And again, that's a very simple example,
20:51
but you can ask anything, even down to
20:55
tiny little details in just a few frames
20:57
of the video. You can ask anything. So
20:59
from the beginning of the video until
21:01
approximately 5:22, he's wearing a
21:02
tie-dye hoodie with a mix of light blue,
21:05
yellow, pink, and white. from that to
21:07
the end, he's wearing a dark gray polo
21:09
shirt. So there you go. Ask any question
Video Dubbing
21:12
to any video. All right. And last, if
21:15
you want to watch videos in any
21:17
language, but you don't want subtitles,
21:19
you just want instant translation, this
21:22
is for you. So we're using the Hey Jen
21:24
video translate feature in replicate. So
21:28
we have this original video, Leonardo
21:30
DiCaprio accepting his Oscar award. I
21:32
believe
21:33
uh The Revenant was a product of the
21:35
tireless efforts of an unbelievable cast
21:38
and crew.
21:38
Okay, that's cool. But what if you want
21:40
it in another language here? That is
21:52
actually translated to another language,
21:54
but the actual mouth movement is synced
21:57
with that new language. It is so
21:59
impressive. So, obviously for me, it
22:01
allows me to take my videos and
22:02
translate them into many languages with
22:05
very little additional work. But if you
22:08
want to take a movie or something else
22:10
and you want to translate it into a
22:11
different language just to enjoy and
22:13
watch in your native language or a new
22:15
language, you can do that as well. So,
22:18
those are all the use cases for today.
