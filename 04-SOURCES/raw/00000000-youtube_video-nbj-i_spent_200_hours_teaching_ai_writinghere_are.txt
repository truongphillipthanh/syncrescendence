AI slop at work is killing businesses. 

The common story is that this is all the model's fault — but the reality is that AI mostly exposes how unclear our thinking and standards have been all along.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on AI-assisted business writing:
• Why most teams are drowning in AI-generated documents
• How to define concrete quality criteria AI can follow
• What “intent-driven” writing means and how to build it in
• Where to use AI not just for writing, but for evaluation too

The takeaway: teams that articulate clear standards and goals will thrive with AI; everyone else will drown in AI slop.

AI has dropped the cost of business
0:02
writing to nearly zero. And most of the
0:04
businesses I work with or know about are
0:06
drowning in AI documents and have huge
0:08
issues with AI business writing. This
0:11
video is how you troubleshoot those.
0:14
What the principles are for using AI
0:16
well in business writing situations. And
0:17
then I'm going to walk through an actual
0:20
example of a prompt I'm using that sets
0:22
a much higher bar for AI business
0:24
writing than I've typically seen. And
0:26
we'll just go through it. So, first
0:27
let's get into the principles. The first
0:29
thing I want you to keep in mind overall
0:31
is that the real bottleneck in AI
0:33
assisted writing is never capability of
0:35
AI. People think it's the model. It's
0:37
not the model. Don't let anyone tell you
0:39
it's the model. It's organizational
0:41
ability to articulate what constitutes
0:44
good work. And typically that means
0:46
we've relied on individuals to have
0:48
instincts for what constitutes good work
0:51
instead of actual structured information
0:55
about what constitute good work. AI
0:57
forces tacet knowledge into explicit
0:59
standards and that is very very hard for
1:02
most businesses. You cannot rely on I
1:04
know it when I see it because AI cannot
1:06
read your mind. It is not that good.
1:08
It's never going to be that good. Every
1:10
quality criteria needs to be concrete
1:12
enough to specify, to test, and to
1:15
verify. That is the only way through on
1:18
the business writing side. And if people
1:19
say, "Well, I don't have time for that."
1:20
I've got to ask you, do you have time
1:22
for the business writing you're drowning
1:24
in? because I have lost track of the
1:27
number of people who are like I cannot
1:30
keep up with the business writing. It is
1:31
too much like people are sending me AI
1:33
slop at work. Well, the quality criteria
1:36
needs to be defined to make that go
1:38
away. So, what does that actually look
1:39
like? First, understand that there is a
1:42
specification bottleneck. The barrier is
1:45
not how fast can I write this anymore.
1:47
It is how clearly can I articulate what
1:49
I need. Every time you have ambiguity in
1:52
your specs for a doc, that is amplified
1:55
through generation. It is not reduced.
1:57
People sometimes think AI can reduce
2:00
ambiguity by adding detail, but anyone
2:02
who's worked with AI a lot will tell you
2:04
it doesn't reduce ambiguity, it enhances
2:06
it. And when it adds helpful detail, it
2:08
makes it worse. So the organizations
2:10
that succeed are actually not those with
2:13
the best writers. I know that's very
2:14
counterintuitive. They are those who can
2:16
articulate the quality standards
2:19
explicitly enough to encode them in
2:22
prompts that you can work with. Now,
2:23
writers can absolutely help with that.
2:26
Good writers are hard to find, but we
2:28
are moving from raw ability to generate
2:31
text according to a congruent prompt
2:34
framework or a congruent template as a
2:36
goal. And we're getting into a world
2:38
where we are just needing to specify our
2:42
requirements really, really clearly. It
2:44
reminds me of like wearing a product hat
2:45
and defining product requirements. Very,
2:47
very similar except now your product is
2:50
the dock. You also have a fundamental
2:52
evaluation issue because of the number
2:55
of prompts. I've talked in the past
2:56
about how we have this issue with
2:58
résumés. Really, it's with all knowledge
3:00
work in the business. We don't have time
3:03
to evaluate everything that got done,
3:06
which means that we have to figure out
3:08
how to scale evaluation. That is one of
3:10
the fundamental challenges for
3:12
businesses that want to go faster. And I
3:14
believe firmly that scaling evaluation
3:17
means putting AI on the evaluation side,
3:20
not just the writing side. And I want to
3:22
talk about that a little bit more
3:24
because I I think we miss that. It is
3:27
absolutely possible. I've done it. I've
3:29
written I'm writing a prompt for this
3:30
article to talk through how you evaluate
3:33
and build a prompt. Build a Claude skill
3:36
that helps you to evaluate. I've done
3:38
it. I'm doing it. it. You can make your
3:41
job so much easier if you are just
3:43
willing to let AI take a first pass and
3:45
give it really clear requirements on
3:47
what good looks like. I also want to go
3:49
beyond just hey you need to specify. The
3:52
other core issue is that we typically
3:54
have longstanding information
3:56
architecture problems in our documents
3:58
at work that we just paper over and that
4:02
we are not going to be able to paper
4:03
over when AI is writing. Because
4:05
fundamentally what AI does is it exposes
4:08
information asymmetries,
4:10
informationational vagueness that
4:12
previously hid in a lot of our writing
4:14
because people wrote it and you just
4:16
assumed that people were doing their
4:17
best thinking. One of the good things
4:19
about the AI age is we now don't assume
4:23
that everyone's doing their best
4:25
thinking which means we critique more
4:26
which is actually healthy. So when we're
4:29
critiquing I want us to think of a few
4:31
things in this information architecture
4:33
bucket. One documents really ought to be
4:36
written for goals and decisions and they
4:38
aren't always. And so if you can't tell
4:40
if this document enables person X to
4:43
make choice Y or if this well structured
4:46
information enables you to make a big
4:48
decision, if you if you don't know what
4:50
it looks like and why you're reading it,
4:52
it's it was going to be useless anyway,
4:54
right? But now we blame the AI. Your
4:56
goal at this point is actually to get
4:58
rid of that vagueness you tolerated in
5:00
the past in the business and define
5:02
theformational architecture of the
5:05
document. Your structure is the business
5:08
logic, not just a template. So many
5:10
times if someone gives you like a
5:12
product requirements document or if they
5:14
give you a business memo or a press
5:17
release, when they give it to a human,
5:19
you get a template. You actually don't
5:22
get the logical underpinnings of the doc
5:25
and people end up learning it from
5:27
experience. Templates just let you fill
5:29
in the boxes without thinking. And when
5:31
you hand AI only a template in the
5:34
prompt, that is what you get. And that
5:36
is why so often when I'm called in to
5:38
help with business writing prompts,
5:39
people say, "I don't know what I did
5:41
wrong. I gave it the template and it
5:44
filled out the template and it's
5:45
terrible. It's crap." Well, you didn't
5:48
give it the the business logic. You
5:50
didn't give it a a decision interface to
5:53
work against. You didn't give it a goal
5:54
for the document. That's why your
5:56
writing is terrible. If you don't give
5:58
it that intent, the business writing is
6:00
going to fail. So, the other piece here,
6:03
this is very counterintuitive. You can't
6:05
just give it a goal and give it business
6:07
logic. In my experience, you also have
6:10
to give good failure tests. You have to
6:15
insist that you know what bad looks
6:19
like. Isn't that funny? Isn't that
6:20
counterintuitive? But if you're trying
6:22
to tell the AI how to do something well,
6:24
it really helps if you have five to
6:26
seven examples of the kinds of quality
6:29
problems you have with these kinds of
6:31
documents. It's like, wow, this
6:32
technical specification document is
6:35
really overspeced on the design and
6:39
insists on a microservices architecture
6:41
when we don't use that. Great. That's a
6:43
failure example. Or this press release,
6:46
it is way too hypy and I hate the hype
6:49
in this press release. It doesn't
6:50
respect the actual product capabilities.
6:53
This executive summary and this
6:55
executive memo is too vague. I need more
6:58
specificity. understand where your
7:00
organization today fails to communicate
7:02
information and you will understand how
7:05
to work with AI to write better. This is
7:08
I'm going to repeat it again a people
7:10
problem at root. It is not the model's
7:12
fault here people. It is our ability in
7:16
organizations to communicate intent
7:19
clearly that is governing our ability to
7:22
work with AI and we're not doing it
7:24
well. I want to tease out some of the
7:25
organizational dynamics too.
7:27
Specifically, one of the things that
7:28
I've noticed that's subtle but painful.
7:30
We are converging on voice because of AI
7:33
and that is leading to
7:35
informationational loss in business
7:37
systems. So, we have an AI default voice
7:40
and too few people understand how to
7:42
push that voice into something that
7:44
communicates their their intent clearly.
7:46
I'm not talking about style here. I'm
7:48
talking about the ability to communicate
7:51
clearly with what really matters. And I
7:53
think the default voice that AI has
7:55
obscures that, right? The default voice
7:57
is diplomatically hedged. It's pseudo
8:00
comprehensive. It's stylistically
8:02
extremely bland. And you don't have the
8:04
ability to carry conviction with that
8:06
voice. If you want to make a bet, you
8:08
don't have the ability to articulate
8:10
real specificity, but in the same
8:12
document to articulate this area is
8:15
vague and uncertain, and I want to admit
8:16
that upfront. Good quality writing has
8:19
that range. And AI, if you just prompt
8:22
it vanilla, does not. And that leads to
8:25
critical information loss. And that is
8:27
part of why businesses feel like they're
8:28
drowning. This information is not super
8:30
high quality. And I'm going to say
8:32
again, it is absolutely possible to do
8:34
that. You can make highquality documents
8:36
with AI. The last thing I want to call
8:38
out before I go over and I show what I
8:41
mean is iteration diagnosis. So this is
8:44
sounds really complicated but very
8:45
simply we need to diagnose the failure
8:48
of people to iterate well with writing.
8:51
In other words, people are trying to say
8:54
make it better on their business
8:55
documents and that is all they're
8:57
writing and it's terrible and it's not
8:59
working. But no one knows how to do it
9:01
better unless they're educated. And what
9:03
they don't realize is that it is a
9:05
people problem to communicate intent and
9:09
that they have to specify their intent
9:10
more clearly if they're not getting a
9:12
draft they like. So I'm going to come
9:14
back to the like the core of this issue
9:16
and then I'm going to show you how I'm
9:17
addressing it with a specific prompt. I
9:19
actually put together a whole bunch of
9:20
prompts and a claude skills for this cuz
9:22
I want you to be equipped and I'm going
9:24
to show you one of the prompts and how
9:25
it works. So the thing to remember is
9:27
because AI assisted writing is exploding
9:30
because organizations are drowning. We
9:32
have that AI generation problem. The
9:34
cost of information is zero. We need to
9:37
therefore put a premium on our intent.
9:41
Otherwise, we degradeformational signal
9:43
through our businesses and it is hard to
9:45
make decisions and we feel like we're
9:47
drowning and it has real career
9:48
implications and real dollars and cents
9:50
implications. I am passionate about good
9:52
business writing. I love it. It is
9:54
getting hard to find because people
9:56
don't know how to prompt. Let's get to
9:58
an actual. Okay, this is an example of a
10:00
prompt that I think is highquality. It
10:02
is also designed to be modular and
10:04
changeable so you can make it the way
10:06
you want. Let's get into it. This is for
10:08
meeting notes. It's the simplest
10:09
possible one. I have a bunch of other
10:11
prompts for more complex docs. Meeting
10:13
notes are overlooked because most of the
10:14
time if you go into a generic AI
10:16
transcript and you get meeting notes is
10:18
just a generic summary that's very
10:20
vanilla of what was there. I wanted to
10:22
be more opinionated because I wanted to
10:24
carry through the principle that you
10:25
need to have intent around what you're
10:27
doing. So we have contacts, date,
10:29
attendees which should be pullable from
10:31
the meeting note raw purpose of meeting
10:34
input provided and you can paste your
10:36
transcript there and then you're asking
10:38
for a very specific output and you can
10:40
modify this when I tell you why I put
10:42
what I did. Your goal here is to create
10:45
notes that help the team execute, right?
10:49
Execute on what was discussed. There is
10:51
a specific goal for this. The notes are
10:53
used in and then there's a context for
10:54
this, right? You can decide where
10:55
they're used. You then have a required
10:57
structure. Did you make decisions? Do
10:59
you have action items? Are there open
11:01
questions that were discussed? What were
11:03
the key discussion points? The vanilla
11:05
notes I get. Look, I love granola. I
11:07
love some otter. Right there. There's
11:09
these AI notes. They do not do this.
11:11
They do not help you encode intent. It
11:14
is up to you to bring this level of
11:16
clarity. And I want to help, but there's
11:19
no substitute for that intent. The AI
11:21
won't bring it. You have constraints.
11:24
You have a total length that you have to
11:26
keep to. You have decisions. You have to
11:27
define an owner by name. You have action
11:30
items. You cannot include pleasantries
11:33
or general discussions. You may not
11:35
infer. You may not guess. This is the
11:38
tone. And then here are validation
11:40
quality checks. Every decision must have
11:42
a name decision maker. Every action item
11:44
must have an owner. No action item is
11:45
allowed to be vague. Open questions must
11:47
have or assigned owners. If any check
11:50
fails, revise before outputting. Is this
11:53
perfect? No prompt is perfect. Is this
11:56
going to get you a long way on intent?
11:58
Yes. And then I want to get into, and I
12:00
do, why the prompt works, right? It
12:02
communicates purpose. It communicates
12:04
structure as logic. And you can change
12:05
that structure if you want a different
12:07
intent. There's an eval mode. There's a
12:08
failure mode. Well, let's look at how to
12:11
customize it, right? And I include that,
12:12
too, right? For your workflow. You can
12:14
change it up. You can change it to your
12:16
organization's voice. You can have
12:18
different meeting types. You can have a
12:19
sprint goal instead. You can have
12:21
failure modes that are different. And
12:23
then I can give you an example of an
12:24
output, right? This is what a good
12:25
output looks like. This is what a
12:26
terrible output looks like, right? And
12:28
this is very similar to the AI notes I
12:30
get generically. Frankly, Chad GPT
12:32
launched a meeting notes feature that
12:33
looks a lot like that top part. This is
12:35
part of how I know we're losing good
12:37
quality business intelligence. Like the
12:39
bottom example is going to be much more
12:43
informative for the business than the
12:45
top. So please, please, I have a bunch
12:48
of these prompts. I don't care if you
12:50
use my prompts or not, but please put
12:53
intent
12:55
into your business AI writing. That is
12:58
the key. And if prompts help you scale
13:00
that across the business, if Claude's
13:01
skills help you scale that across the
13:03
business, I built both of those. That's
13:05
great. But that there is no substitute.
13:08
You you cannot get away from the need
13:11
for humans to define what good looks
13:14
like for AI and to define requirements.
13:16
And to be honest with you, that is the
13:18
thing I'm excited about. We have sat for
13:20
a long time with the assumption that
13:22
human best effort is kind of the bar for
13:25
docs and we just all have like I worked
13:27
at Amazon and we had like a bar for docs
13:29
that floated around best based on the
13:31
best human writer in the team in the
13:33
department etc. You don't have to have
13:35
that anymore. You can have a really
13:37
consistent highquality bar and you can
13:39
know whether someone is writing to that
13:41
bar or not. And people ask me all the
13:43
time, well does this mean people won't
13:44
think anymore? I I dare you. I dare you.
13:48
Are you going to think less if you go
13:50
through this process? If you actually
13:52
define intent for your business with
13:54
writing, no, you are going to think
13:56
more. You are going to think harder.
13:58
You're going to have to work harder to
13:59
communicate all of this to people
14:01
because so much of it was vague and
14:02
lived in people's heads. Well, not
14:04
anymore. And the reason why you're going
14:06
to have to do this is because the
14:08
alternative is not what we had pre202
14:11
where everyone wrote everything. The
14:13
alternative is AI slot forever because
14:17
AI is out of the box. Everyone's using
14:19
it and everybody I know at work that's
14:21
drowning in AI docs, which is a lot of
14:23
people. Well, that's not going to stop.
14:26
The people making them aren't going to
14:27
stop because they think it's productive.
14:29
We need AI education that emphasizes
14:32
quality, that emphasizes the different
14:35
ways we need to think. I hope this video
14:36
has helped you think about how our
14:38
brains need to change to communicate
14:40
effectively with AI when we are writing.
14:43
Best of luck out there and may you long
14:46
save and long preserve your business
14:48
from AI slop and bad business writing. I
14:51
hope these tips have helped.
