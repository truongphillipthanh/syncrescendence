---

**Anders:** Welcome to another episode of the Quantum Economy Podcast. Today I'm joined by Matthew Kinsella, the CEO of Infleqtion. Matt has a fascinating background from venture capital and deep tech investments. He was the seed investor in Infleqtion back in 2018 before joining the company as their CEO in 2024, taking the company from a spin-out to a global player shaping the future of quantum technologies in the field of defense, logistics, finance, and beyond. Now at the helm of Infleqtion, he's going public with the company and building the infrastructure of a quantum future far beyond computing alone. He has big hopes for humanity and his values in place. Joining me from Boulder, Colorado, the US capital of quantum, here is the Quantum Economy Podcast with Matt Kinsella.

So Matt, first of all, thank you for coming on. Is it the way to go with quantum now to take a business-minded person, put him on the top as CEO, go public, and commercialize? Are we there now?

**Matthew:** Well, thank you for having me, Anders. I guess so, right? Because that has been my trajectory to get into the company. I came from the investment world, was the first investor in Infleqtion back in early 2018, have been on the board ever since helping to build the company, and then stepped in full-time to work at the business full-time back in the beginning of last year. We made the decision earlier this year that this was the right path for us to go for a lot of different reasons.

**Anders:** You have that background as a deep tech investor. It's not very typical to then take on an operational role, in particular if you look at the interest of a broader deep tech portfolio. What made you go into that role now and see that Infleqtion is the right horse to bet on, so to speak?

**Matthew:** You're very right that this is not that normal. And actually if I flush out the whole situation for you, you'll see that there were many versions of the world where this would not have been the path of least resistance. 

So if we go back to 2017—well, even go back further. I was at my firm Maverick for 18 years. I started there right out of college. Maverick is both a public equity investment fund and a venture capital fund. I started my career on the public equity side of the business, investing in the stock market, focus on technology. Then in 2014 we decided as a firm to launch an early-stage venture fund. This context is important just to answer your question actually. 

Lee Ainslie, the founder of the fund, asked me to move out to San Francisco from New York to get that early-stage venture fund off the ground alongside a partner. And for the next 10 years or so, I was one of those partners running that early-stage venture capital business.

In 2017 we started to come across a lot of early quantum computing opportunities. Now, back then—we're talking seven and a half years ago now—a lot of people were dismissive of quantum computing. I was very intrigued by it from the start. I came from a family where my dad was an electrical engineer and my mom was actually a chemistry teacher. So physics and chemistry were sort of in my blood from birth, but I certainly was not trained as a scientist. I didn't get a PhD. I studied business in college. 

But I had this fascination with the space that allowed me to spend the time necessary in 2017 to figure out what was real. Because there was a lot of just noise and maybe a little bit of hype back then. But there was something underneath that hype that was real. I spent enough time to figure out what was real and what was not.

In 2017 we came across the founders of Infleqtion, and what they were doing resonated with me because I had spent time with all the different quantum modalities at that point—superconducting, trapped ion, photonics, topological—

**Anders:** Were you the guy on the superconducting bandwagon, or were you always for neutral atom?

**Matthew:** No, actually. When I started this journey I was more intrigued by trapped ion. I spent time with the IonQ folks, with the Honeywell folks. I spent time with IBM on superconducting. I was trying to understand whether quantum computing was going to be real. This is 2017—we're talking before there was even something called NISQ[^1] devices, before there was anything that really looked like a quantum computer. These things were in labs, in dilution refrigerators, and it was not clear that any of this was going to work.

What really drew me to the Infleqtion founders and what they were doing with neutral atom was that they had a technology platform that could be applied to a bunch of different markets. So it wasn't just quantum computing—it was also quantum sensors, it was quantum networks, it was RF receivers. This thing we call Rydberg antennas that can basically take over from traditional RF antennas. 

So they had this platform that had multiple revenue streams that we could pursue at varying degrees of technical risk. That was important for me because I was a little bit more skeptical back then about when quantum computing was going to work. I wanted to have that diversification from a business perspective to make sure that we could build a sustainable company, where we weren't overly reliant on quantum computing being ready in the next few years.

That diversification was really important. It also was important because neutral atom is a room-temperature technology. It doesn't require a dilution refrigerator. That makes it a lot more cost-effective to deploy. It makes it a lot easier to scale. That caught my attention because I saw both the technology advantages as well as the business model advantages.

**Anders:** When you look at it now, quantum computers have changed the narrative, right? And the whole industry, perception, investment, has changed dramatically. We will get to that. But did you always see yourself becoming the CEO? Or did you go in as an investor thinking, "This is going to be my next portfolio company"?

**Matthew:** Great question. The answer is no, I did not see myself becoming the CEO at the time. I saw this as a great investment opportunity. At the time I was building an early-stage venture fund focused on deep tech—AI, robotics, space. Quantum was becoming part of that thesis. I was looking to make great investments, help build great companies, and have an outsized return.

What shifted was a few things. One, the company got to a scale where it needed someone with more experience running larger organizations. The founders were PhDs who had built this incredible technology, but the company was getting to a point where it needed someone who had seen what good looked like at scale. That's where I came in.

The second thing was that I had been on the board for six years at that point. I knew the company better than almost anybody. I knew where the bodies were buried. I knew the opportunities. I knew the challenges. And I had developed such a passion for what we were building that when the opportunity presented itself, it felt like the right move for me personally.

The third thing was timing. The quantum industry was reaching an inflection point—no pun intended—where the narrative was shifting from "if" to "when." That's a really important shift, both from a business perspective and from a capital markets perspective. I felt like this was the moment where having someone who understood how to navigate public markets, how to scale businesses, how to work with governments—because a lot of what we do is dual-use technology—was going to be critical for the next phase of the company's growth.

So it all came together at the right time. It wasn't planned from the beginning, but it felt inevitable once it happened.

**Anders:** Let's talk about that shift from "if" to "when." That's a massive psychological and economic shift. What changed? What made people believe?

**Matthew:** A few things converged. The first was just the sheer amount of capital that started flowing into the space. When we made our seed investment in 2018, quantum computing was still very much a science project. By 2021, 2022, you started to see billions of dollars flowing in—not just from venture capitalists, but from governments, from strategic investors, from big tech companies.

That capital created momentum. It allowed companies to hire the best people, build better hardware, develop better software. And as the hardware got better, we started to see real demonstrations of quantum advantage—even if they were narrow, even if they were contrived benchmarks. The fact that we could point to something and say, "Look, this quantum computer did something that a classical computer cannot do in a reasonable amount of time," that was a watershed moment.

The second thing was error correction. For a long time, the concern was that qubits were too noisy, too error-prone to ever be useful. But over the last few years, we've made enormous strides in error correction techniques. We're now talking about logical qubits—qubits that are error-corrected to the point where they can perform reliable computations. That's a game-changer.

The third thing was applications. We started to see real use cases emerge—not just theoretical ones. Drug discovery, materials science, optimization problems in logistics and finance. These are areas where quantum computing can deliver tangible value, and companies are willing to pay for that value. That changes the conversation from "this is a cool science project" to "this is a business."

And then finally, there's the geopolitical dimension. Quantum computing is now seen as a matter of national security. The U.S., China, the EU—they're all racing to build quantum computers because they understand that whoever gets there first is going to have a massive strategic advantage. That's created a sense of urgency that didn't exist five years ago.

All of those things together shifted the narrative from "if" to "when." And once that shift happens, valuations change, timelines change, investor psychology changes. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy in some ways.

**Anders:** That's fascinating because it mirrors what we've seen in AI. The moment the narrative shifted from "AI is overhyped" to "AI is inevitable," the entire industry transformed. But here's my question: Are we in danger of creating another hype cycle? Are we overestimating how quickly quantum will deliver?

**Matthew:** That's a great question, and I think the answer is yes and no. Yes, there is hype. Any time you have billions of dollars flowing into a space, there's going to be hype. There are going to be companies that overpromise and underdeliver. There are going to be investors who get caught up in the narrative and invest in things that don't pan out.

But here's why I think it's different from previous hype cycles: The underlying science is real. This isn't like the dot-com bubble where people were investing in business models that didn't make sense. The physics works. We know quantum computers can solve certain problems faster than classical computers. The question is not *if* but *when* and *for what*.

And that's where I think people need to be careful. Not every problem is a quantum problem. There are a lot of problems that classical computers will continue to solve better and more cheaply than quantum computers. What we need to do as an industry is be honest about where quantum has an advantage and where it doesn't.

For Infleqtion, that's why we're focused on multiple markets. We're not betting everything on quantum computing. We have quantum sensors that are already generating revenue today. We have quantum networks that are solving real problems for defense and telecommunications customers. We have Rydberg antennas that can replace traditional RF systems. These are near-term revenue opportunities that de-risk the business while we continue to develop our quantum computing capabilities.

So I think the hype is real, but the substance is also real. The key is not to get caught up in the hype and to focus on building real products that solve real problems for real customers.

**Anders:** Let's talk about those real products. You mentioned quantum sensors, quantum networks, Rydberg antennas. For people who aren't deep in the quantum weeds, can you explain what these things are and why they matter?

**Matthew:** Absolutely. So let's start with quantum sensors. At the most basic level, quantum sensors exploit the sensitivity of quantum systems to measure things with incredible precision. Think of it this way: Quantum systems are exquisitely sensitive to their environment. That's actually a problem for quantum computing because you want your qubits to be isolated from noise. But for sensing, that sensitivity is a feature, not a bug.

We can use quantum sensors to measure magnetic fields, gravitational fields, time, acceleration—all with precision that's orders of magnitude better than classical sensors. One of our flagship products is a quantum accelerometer that can be used for navigation in GPS-denied environments. If you're a submarine, if you're an aircraft operating in contested airspace, you can't rely on GPS because it can be jammed or spoofed. But a quantum accelerometer can give you precise positioning without any external signal.

That has enormous implications for defense, but also for commercial applications—autonomous vehicles, underground mining, anywhere you need precise navigation without GPS.

Quantum networks are a bit different. These are networks that use quantum entanglement to create secure communication channels. The beauty of quantum key distribution is that it's fundamentally secure. If anyone tries to intercept the communication, the quantum state collapses and you know you've been compromised. That's a level of security that's impossible with classical encryption.

We're working with defense customers and financial institutions who care deeply about secure communications. And as we move into a world where quantum computers can break traditional encryption, quantum networks become essential infrastructure.

Then there's Rydberg antennas. These are really cool. Essentially, we use atoms in a highly excited state—called Rydberg states—to detect radio frequency signals. The atoms are so sensitive that they can pick up incredibly weak signals, and they can do it across a huge range of frequencies. That means one Rydberg antenna can replace dozens of traditional antennas. For defense applications, for 5G and 6G networks, for satellite communications, this is a game-changer.

**Anders:** So you're basically saying Infleqtion is not just a quantum computing company. It's a quantum technology platform company.

**Matthew:** Exactly. That's a really important distinction. A lot of the quantum computing companies are building quantum computers and that's it. If quantum computing takes longer to mature than people expect, those companies are in trouble. We've deliberately built a platform that can generate revenue across multiple markets with varying degrees of technical risk.

That diversification is good for our customers, it's good for our investors, and it's good for our employees. It means we're not betting everything on one technology timeline. We can generate revenue today from quantum sensors and networks while we continue to develop our quantum computing capabilities.

And here's the other thing: All of these technologies share a common platform—neutral atom. The same underlying physics, the same engineering capabilities, the same supply chain. That creates enormous operational leverage. We can amortize our R&D costs across multiple product lines. We can share learnings and best practices. We can move talent between different parts of the business as priorities shift.

That's the power of a platform approach. And it's why I think Infleqtion is well-positioned to be one of the winners in this space.

**Anders:** Let's talk about the go-public decision. That's a big move, especially in this environment. What's the thinking there?

**Matthew:** It's a great question, and it's one we debated a lot internally. There are a few reasons why we think going public is the right move for Infleqtion at this stage.

The first is capital. Scaling quantum technologies requires enormous amounts of capital. We need to build fabs, we need to hire world-class talent, we need to support long sales cycles with government and enterprise customers. Being a public company gives us access to deeper pools of capital than we could get from venture alone.

The second is credibility. When you're selling to governments and large enterprises, being a public company sends a signal. It says, "We're here for the long haul. We have governance structures in place. We have transparency. You can trust us with your most critical missions." That matters a lot in our markets.

The third is liquidity. We've been building this company for over six years. We have early employees and investors who have been with us from the beginning. Going public gives them liquidity and allows us to continue to use equity as a tool to attract and retain talent.

And then finally, there's timing. The quantum industry is at an inflection point. There's massive government support, there's commercial traction, there's a clear path to quantum advantage. We think this is the right time to be a public company in this space.

Now, that said, going public is hard. There's more scrutiny, more pressure to deliver quarterly results, more regulatory overhead. But we think we're ready for that. We have the leadership team, we have the technology, we have the customer traction. This feels like the right next chapter for Infleqtion.

**Anders:** When you think about the competitive landscape—IBM, Google, IonQ, all the players—where does Infleqtion fit? What's your differentiation?

**Matthew:** I think there are a few dimensions to think about this. The first is modality. We're a neutral atom company. IBM and Google are superconducting. IonQ is trapped ion. Each modality has trade-offs. Superconducting requires cryogenic cooling, which is expensive and hard to scale. Trapped ion has great coherence times but is challenging to scale to large numbers of qubits. Neutral atom is room temperature, it's highly scalable, and it has natural advantages for certain types of problems—particularly optimization and simulation.

The second dimension is application focus. A lot of the big tech companies are building general-purpose quantum computers. They want to be the AWS of quantum computing. That's a valid strategy, but it also means they're playing a long game. They're not going to generate meaningful revenue for years.

We're taking a different approach. We're focused on specific use cases where quantum has a clear advantage and where customers are willing to pay today. Defense and national security is a huge focus for us. Precision timing and navigation. Secure communications. These are markets where the value proposition is crystal clear and where we can generate revenue now.

The third dimension is the platform approach I mentioned earlier. We're not just a quantum computing company. We're a quantum technology company. That diversification gives us resilience and optionality that pure-play quantum computing companies don't have.

So where do we fit? I think we're positioned as the company that's delivering practical quantum applications today while building toward the long-term promise of quantum computing. We're not trying to beat IBM or Google in the race to build the most qubits. We're trying to build the most valuable quantum technology company by solving real problems for real customers.

**Anders:** That's a really elegant positioning. Let's shift gears a bit. You mentioned defense and national security. That's obviously a huge market, but it's also a sensitive one. How do you think about dual-use technologies and the responsibility that comes with that?

**Matthew:** It's a great question and one that I think about a lot. Quantum technology is fundamentally dual-use. The same technology that can break encryption can also protect it. The same sensors that can detect submarines can also be used for geological surveys. The same navigation systems that help military aircraft can also help autonomous vehicles.

So the question is not whether quantum technology will be used for defense—it will. The question is how we approach that responsibly.

For us, the starting point is values. We're very clear about who we will and won't work with. We work with the U.S. government and its allies. We're supporting democratic nations. We're not selling to adversaries. That's a clear line for us.

The second thing is transparency. We're very open about the fact that we work with defense customers. We don't hide it. We think it's important work. Quantum technology is going to reshape the balance of power in the world, and we want to make sure that democracies are on the winning side of that.

But we're also very thoughtful about export controls, about ITAR[^2] compliance, about making sure that our technology doesn't fall into the wrong hands. We work closely with government agencies to make sure we're doing this right.

And then finally, we think about the broader impact. Yes, we work with defense customers, but we also work with commercial customers. We're solving problems in healthcare, in logistics, in communications. The technology is bigger than any one application.

I also think it's worth noting that some of the most important technological breakthroughs in history have come from defense R&D. The internet, GPS, jet engines—these all came out of defense research and then had massive commercial applications. I think quantum technology will follow a similar path.

So we approach this with a sense of responsibility, but also with a sense of purpose. This technology matters. It's going to reshape the world. And we want to make sure it's used for good.

**Anders:** That's a really thoughtful answer. Let's talk about the broader ecosystem. One of the things that's interesting about quantum is how much government support there is—CHIPS and Science Act in the U.S., Quantum Flagship in Europe, massive investments in China. How do you think about the role of government in building this industry?

**Matthew:** I think government has a critical role to play, and it's actually a really interesting inflection point in how we think about innovation more broadly.

For the last few decades, the dominant narrative in tech has been that innovation comes from the bottom up. Entrepreneurs in garages building the next big thing. VCs funding crazy ideas. Government getting out of the way. That model worked incredibly well for software and the internet.

But I think we're entering a new era where that model alone is not sufficient. Quantum technology, semiconductors, space, advanced materials—these are areas that require enormous amounts of capital, long time horizons, and strategic coordination. No individual company can do this alone. You need governments to play a coordinating role.

The CHIPS and Science Act is a great example. The U.S. government recognized that we were losing our lead in semiconductor manufacturing, and they stepped in with $52 billion to rebuild that capability. That's the kind of strategic investment that only governments can make.

The same is true for quantum. The National Quantum Initiative in the U.S., the Quantum Flagship in Europe, the investments in China—these are strategic bets that governments are making because they understand that quantum technology is a matter of national competitiveness.

Now, that said, I don't think government should be picking winners and losers. The role of government should be to create the conditions for innovation—funding basic research, building infrastructure, creating standards, supporting early-stage companies through procurement. But the actual innovation should still come from entrepreneurs and companies.

And I think that's the balance we're seeing in quantum. Governments are creating the conditions, but companies like Infleqtion are doing the hard work of turning science into products.

**Anders:** That's a really important point about the changing role of government in innovation. But I want to push back a little bit. We've seen in the past that government-led industrial policy can lead to inefficiency, to cronyism, to picking the wrong technologies. How do you avoid those pitfalls?

**Matthew:** You're absolutely right to be concerned about that. History is littered with examples of government industrial policy that went wrong. Solyndra in solar. The Concorde in aerospace. There are plenty of cautionary tales.

I think the key is to maintain competition and avoid capture. Government should support the ecosystem, not pick winners. That means funding multiple approaches, multiple modalities, multiple companies. Let the market figure out what works.

It also means having clear metrics for success and being willing to cut off funding for things that aren't working. One of the problems with government programs is that they tend to live forever because of political inertia. We need to be more ruthless about killing programs that aren't delivering.

And then finally, I think we need to maintain a strong role for private capital. Government can provide the initial de-risking, can support basic research, can help with early-stage commercialization. But ultimately, private markets need to be the arbiter of what's valuable. If a technology can't attract private investment, if it can't generate revenue, if it can't stand on its own—that's a signal that maybe it's not the right path.

So I think the answer is a partnership model. Government provides strategic support and creates the conditions for success. Private companies and investors take the risk and drive commercialization. And we maintain competitive tension to make sure we're funding the best ideas, not just the best-connected companies.

That's the model we need to make this work. And I think we're seeing it play out reasonably well in quantum so far.

**Anders:** Let's talk about talent. One of the big challenges in quantum is that you need people who understand both the physics and the engineering and the business. How do you build a team that has all of those capabilities?

**Matthew:** Talent is probably our biggest constraint as a company and as an industry. There just aren't that many people in the world who understand quantum physics at a deep level, can translate that into engineering, and can think about it from a business perspective.

So we've had to be really creative about how we build the team. One approach is to hire people with deep expertise in one domain and then train them in the others. So we'll hire a brilliant physicist and teach them about product management. Or we'll hire someone with manufacturing experience and teach them about quantum mechanics.

The other approach is to build partnerships with universities. We have close relationships with CU Boulder, with MIT, with Stanford. We do joint research programs. We fund graduate students. We offer internships. That pipeline is critical for us.

We also think a lot about culture. Quantum is hard. The timelines are long. The problems are difficult. You need people who are intellectually curious, who are comfortable with ambiguity, who can work across disciplines. So we try to create an environment where the best people want to work. That means giving them autonomy, giving them hard problems to solve, giving them the resources they need to succeed.

And then finally, we're very thoughtful about diversity. We need people from different backgrounds, different perspectives, different ways of thinking. The old model of tech companies where everyone went to the same schools and worked at the same companies—that doesn't work for quantum. This is too hard, too multidisciplinary. You need cognitive diversity to solve these problems.

So talent is a constant challenge, but it's also one of our biggest competitive advantages. The team we've built at Infleqtion is world-class, and I think that's going to be a huge differentiator as we scale.

**Anders:** Before we wrap up, I want to go back to something you said at the beginning about quantum computers and GPUs. You made this point about how GPUs are fundamentally limited by binary logic, and quantum computers operate according to how nature actually works. Can you expand on that?

**Matthew:** Sure. So the way I think about it is this: No matter how powerful GPUs get, no matter if we have some breakthrough in energy and we're able to bend the curve on power demands, there are still classes of problems that they just aren't well-suited to solve.

The most powerful GPU cluster at the end of the day is boiling all problems down to zeros and ones. And it's unbelievable what you can do with that binary logic when done billions of times. They're going to keep finding great new use cases to point that zero and one logic at.

But that is not actually how nature works. Nature behaves by the laws of quantum mechanics. And so the problems that are under that bucket—whether that's molecular modeling, material science, drug discovery, optimization problems—I think quantum computers are going to get quantum advantage on those types of problems relatively quickly because the underlying architecture is just suited to solve those problems.

It's as opposed to trying to force-fit that zero and one logic into these types of problems where it's just a heuristic. The world doesn't actually work in zeros and ones. It works based on quantum mechanics. We can force-fit that heuristic into quantum mechanics to a certain extent, but it will be much more efficient to do it with an underlying quantum architecture because that is how the world actually works.

That's the fundamental insight. Classical computers are amazing, but they're simulating reality. Quantum computers *are* reality, at least at the quantum level. That's why they have a natural advantage for certain types of problems.

**Anders:** That's a beautiful way to put it. Now I want to get philosophical for a minute. We've talked about all the business and technical stuff, but I'm curious about your personal worldview. You mentioned earlier that you're Catholic, you've read a lot of Stoicism. How do you reconcile quantum mechanics with faith?

**Matthew:** Wow, I love this question. Let me say a few things before I answer so you know where I'm coming from.

I grew up Catholic. I'm Christian, and I believe in a higher power of some sort. I've also spent a lot of time reading Stoicism, and the idea of the logos—the underlying logic of the world—makes a lot of sense to me. There are a lot of ways in which Stoicism and Catholicism are quite similar.

I've been so in the race of building Infleqtion that I haven't had a chance to really sit back and ponder some of these things, but I think the tie-ins between quantum and religion and philosophy are fascinating.

Even just at the most basic level, religion has always seemed to occupy that space between human understanding and what we don't understand. When thunder would go off, that must have been something that the gods did, right? But once we understood what that was, it shrank that space. But quantum still very much occupies that space. It doesn't really make intuitive sense to us, and so I think there is a chance that maybe that is the layer where you can start to think of the higher power residing in some way. Maybe. Or maybe we'll figure it out and then religion will occupy a different space. But I do think it's a really interesting topic to explore.

I'll see these posts on X about how quantum is the only way to give AI actual spirit or consciousness. And I wish I could dig into them more. Maybe someday I'll sit back and would love to talk to you more about this kind of stuff offline because I find it fascinating. But I do think there is something there at the very basic level, and it's fascinating to let your mind go to those places to think about.

**Anders:** I don't need solid ground under my feet. I've gone down all this rabbit hole and I consider myself agnostic atheist. If you have a computer, you have a simulation—you don't have to render everything into perfect pixels. It can dissolve. I don't need that structure. I can dance between the explicable and the dimension of whatever you want to call it.

It's very fascinating. I'm very privileged to learn from all these very smart people and listen to them—how they are held hostage in their own domain. My co-author just published a very interesting paper on the quantum memory matrix where he argues that any information in the universe is stored in a quantum memory matrix. Basically, meaning is information and it could collapse into some kind of a big crunch, a singularity where in a black hole information is stored. That has been peer-reviewed and published. The first thing that he got was, "Well, this is Akashic records."

You just see that the whole dimension of spirituality and some kind of holistic universe—there are so many ways to go about it. And I 100% agree with you. We have gone through history where we have thin-sliced what we claimed to be godly and put a label, a math formula on it. I think that's where we're heading. We're moving towards the unification of mythology, folklore, and enlightenment—basically where science and philosophy could meet.

I think a lot about this. I have the privilege of not being responsible for a bunch of people in my organization, so I can sit down and think about this. But I resonate very much with your drive because it has become to me also now a passion to actually build it. I have this vision to build a human being by applying this. I literally hope I fail because it takes away the magic.

But totally—all the dimensions that you mentioned, on that path to understanding qualia, consciousness, life at a cellular level—there is so much business. And that's why I liked your values and philosophy. Capitalism—more power to it if it serves for the benefit of humanity and we can use technology for progress. This was something that I wanted to get a feeling for because I read a little bit about your drive towards improving the state of humanity. I think that's very important in today's world to have leaders that unite those values.

**Matthew:** Thank you. I totally agree. It's really important.

**Anders:** So do you think the brain is a quantum computer, or is there something magical? Is there some godliness to it?

**Matthew:** Boy, I don't... I still, until maybe scientifically proven wrong, think that God plays an element in there. But that could be—He just designed the quantum computer or something, right? I don't know. It's... I default to my religious beliefs, but honestly I haven't thought deeply enough about those in so long, especially after having gone down the quantum rabbit hole. I do need to go sit in a dark room and just think and get my head straight on all these things.

**Anders:** What a beautiful way to end the hour, Matt—to take us back from a capitalistically-driven investor who has a deep passion for deep technologies, going into the role of the CEO, driving towards going public, and then taking it back to religion. I think we've covered it all.

**Matthew:** We've covered it all, Anders.

**Anders:** Again, Matt, thank you so much for doing this with me, spending so much time. This was a blast. Congrats on all the things that you're doing. I'm going to follow Infleqtion, and I hope to have a chat with you on or offline at a later point or in the near future.

**Matthew:** I'd love that. I'd love it. Well, thank you for this and thanks for having me on the show.

**Anders:** Thank you so much, Matt.
