I worked at Tesla starting from 2017 thru 2021. I spent most of my time in the distribution and supply chain organizations in leadership positions.

Before Tesla, I was a Director of Business Intelligence and Pricing at the largest Pet Food & Supply distributor in the US, Phillips Pet Food & Supplies. My wife and I also owned a small business in Bethlehem, PA between 2016 and 2019.

I have been a shareholder of Tesla since 2012 and currently own Tesla stock. Nothing I say constitutes as investment or financial advice.

China's Manufacturing Dominance
0:00
I'm gonna start this hot. Ready? Okay. Okay. I'm gonna make a very a very aggressive statement. Uh and I and I'll
0:06
give a I'll give a background on who Jordan is. He's been on the channel before, but I just want to start with this very aggressive statement and I
0:12
want you to tell me if you agree. Okay. Okay. Tesla has solved self-driving.
0:18
I knew that was going to be the question. Yes, I think they have.
0:25
That's a that's a scary answer to give. I'm going to get shipped for that. But I think so.
0:30
And I'm going to give some background now on Jordan and then I'm going to let you let you kind of dive into sort of
0:36
your thought process. I'll give you my thought process. So Jordan um he lives in New York or around the area
0:43
of New York City, Manhattan. Look at him. He's wearing a Nick's uh hoodie, whatever that is. A sweater, whatever.
0:50
Shout out to the Knicks. And um he has driven FSD in the city. not just with
Introduction of Michael Dun
0:57
his personal car, but in the latest version, we've also seen him driving around the latest version of FSD V14 in
1:04
Manhattan, which is probably, you know, you said, I think in the video, you said it's probably the most challenging driving environment in the United
1:10
States, and I think people who have driven in the United States will probably agree with that. Manhattan is a is a [ __ ] show. It's crazy.
1:16
Um, and then that 2-hour long drive y'all did together showed the car outside of like what I
1:22
remember one navigation error. It was because of the map. the map was g making you guys go the wrong way. So the guy
1:28
took over and was like, "Ah, not this way. Let's go this way." Yeah. Outside of that mapping error, the car handled every situation, not just
1:34
flawlessly, but how a New Yorker would. And I think that's the more important takeaway there.
1:40
And so I want you to talk through your experience and then we can take it
1:45
wherever you want to go. But um you know, to me it feels like if it can drive in New York like a New Yorker,
China's Leverage in the Auto Industry
1:52
what else does it need to do before we can call it solved? Yeah, I mean that's that's a good question. At first I guess I I want to
1:58
shout out Ananto who who let me know go along for the ride with him. He's uh early access. He has a 20 26 uh Model Y
2:07
and you know I wouldn't get the chance to even be on the on the podcast today if we weren't you know able to do that
2:12
drive. So, first of all, thanks thanks to him. And uh yeah, I I mean I I guess comparing it to
2:20
V13, right? I thought that it got around the city pretty well. It it didn't make
The Rise of Electric Vehicles in China
2:26
a lot of mistakes, but it definitely didn't drive like a New Yorker and it
2:31
definitely didn't have the patience to or people around you were I guess uh you
2:36
know had to be patient and the people in the car had to be patient. Now, I think that's just all out the window. The car
2:43
drives, especially in MadMax mode. It It drives like someone who is native to New
2:49
York, which is like pretty crazy to pretty crazy to say. Um, just the reaction times on every every little
2:56
thing, the ability for it to like change lanes and then change back really fast,
3:01
just the overall smoothness. And I I know that's been a a point of contention with V14 so far. I I I didn't really
3:08
feel like it was any less smooth than V13, you know, in the limited testing that I have. It just thinks way faster.
3:15
It thinks way harder. It just feels like it's it's sentient in in a lot of ways.
3:20
Um, and I think that, you know, is is is really the bottom line is that that it
3:26
just thinks a lot and it's making those choices and decisions in a in a way that's just very different than previous
3:31
versions have. What's some of the most complicated stuff that I did on y'all's drive? cuz
3:37
you know like in in Manhattan from from the videos and having driven there many many many many times that it's just the
3:43
the unpredictability of what you're going to face seems like one of the most challenging things and it's the unpredictability on top of the people
3:50
around you that don't have patience for you to think about what you want to do because people just be like okay yeah we
3:55
see this all the time just go around this or like just avoid this or like you know just clear the box like who cares just whatever you know so what walk me
4:02
through like the top two let's say most challenging environments that you saw and the way that the software navigated
China's Ambition for Global Auto Market Control
4:08
those. Yeah. Um, it's a good question. I I would say the
4:15
first of all, I guess I'll also say we only did one drive and, you know, people
4:21
accuse FSD content creators of I guess like cherrypicking content and you know, going on 10 drives and picking the best
4:27
one. I had no idea what we were getting into before we started this and I didn't know if we were going to get a bunch of
4:33
highlight clips or if it was just going to be 2 hours of driving around in Manhattan and it was going to be just super boring. Thankfully, I I would say
4:40
we got a lot of highlight clips and um you know, just to to pick a few, I think
4:46
that the situation where we got stuck by that smoke cone or uh you know, there's
4:51
like a vent showcased how crazy good the car has gotten at thinking. Normally you
4:58
just like go around them. A lot of times the car would get stuck before and then it would make the turn and it would get
5:03
out, but it would just feel like a little bit goofy. Um, it got to a spot where it had to like back up away from
5:10
the cone to clear the box. And watching it do that was just a crazy moment. You
5:15
just sitting in the car thinking, "Oh, I probably should back up." and then the car just shifts into reverse and does it
5:21
right in front of you and then just shifts back into drive and it's just waiting there at the light like any normal person would do. Now, I don't
5:28
even think many non- New Yorkers would be uh willing to put the car in reverse
5:34
and like back up. You know, most people would be worried they're going to like slam into someone behind them, but I'm surprised the car did it. And uh you
5:40
know, that that's a I guess a moment of like sentient sentience s I can't talk today. Sensience. Sentience.
5:47
Sensience. Something like that. The car The car felt alive. You know, it's a weird word. I'm not gonna lie.
5:53
Sensience is like There you go. Why would Elon even Anyway, whatever. Well, you know, they make it hard for
5:59
for us. They do. I'd say that was one of the scenarios. And then um I mean pulling over for
6:07
emergency vehicles immediately after we got caught in that situation where like the the police were turning around and
6:14
then it's just like weaving in and out of cars immediately after it. It's just crazy to watch. And you know you may get
6:22
you may get one of these scenarios in a standard suburban drive, right? You know
6:27
an ambulance will come and you'll have to like get out of the way. But there was just so many things like stacked on
6:33
this drive and probably parts of the video that I sped up that you know were
6:38
really cool but boring for New York City driving. It just did so many like perfect moves back to back to back to
6:45
back. It would like get out of the way of a cab then like move back to the right and then it wouldn't get like stuck behind the UPS truck or something
6:52
like that. And those those moments, they seem small, but it takes a a half hour
6:57
drive that the V13 team would do and turns it into 20 minutes, you know, or
7:02
25 minutes. And I'm not saying that's a lot of time, but when you're stacking these moments together, especially when
7:08
it's like a robo taxi, you know, that's an extra two, three, four rides the car can get in during a day, that's a that's
7:15
a huge difference for for, you know, you you and uh if you're making, I guess, money doing it.
7:21
Yeah. Did you did you expect so so I remember the first time you were on the channel was VI 13. You got V13 on your
7:27
Model X I believe and that was uh I know you've done content before but that was like the big
7:33
one that like caught my eye cuz I'm always watching these like FSD videos from all content creators cuz I'm I'm
7:39
trying to understand how the the software is progressing in every scenario, you know. So now we're getting
7:45
FSD videos out of Canada with them and we're getting it out of New York City with you. We got Omar in California.
7:51
We've got, you know, JD doing his thing. We got Chuck in Florida. You know, like we have it's like in it's like the
7:56
craziest thing of all time. We got these this like a propagation of like testers everywhere. And then the insane thing
8:03
with V14. It's like everyone is coming back with look at these bangers, bro.
8:09
Like it's Sawyer just went to Boston and did a three-hour no intervention drive in in Boston. Like Boston's a psycho
8:16
place. I know. cuz cuz y'all are a grit, but they're like 1700s horse carriage layout
8:22
European style, right? And everyone and and then it's it's the it's the same
8:27
car. It's the same car that was built for 30 grand or so, right? Across the
8:33
Tesla or whatever. And then this car is doing unbelievable maneuvers extremely safely with massive confidence
8:41
and complete awareness in all these super complex environments around the world.
8:47
Um, so when you had V13 and your Model X, did you expect to be where you are now with the new experience that you
8:54
just had with V14? Like, did you think it was going to take longer or was this part for the course based on what you saw before?
9:02
Thank you to the sponsor of this podcast, Rebellionire. Rebellionire partners with Tesla investors who have at least $2 million in Tesla stock to
9:09
reach their financial goals. Other investment firms might look at your Tesla position and think, "Wow, you have way too much. This is way too risky."
9:15
But Rebellionire actually embraces the long-term potential of a company like Tesla. They'll also look to maximize
9:20
your profits by employing different tactics like selling covered calls, adding or trimming, etc. And the Rebellionaire team, which includes
9:27
Bradford Ferguson and Matt Smith, they do this by spending a lot of time analyzing Tesla the company in very
China's Stranglehold on Battery and Magnet Supply Chains
9:33
novel and unique ways. They've done things like crosscountry FSD trips, the self-driving suite that Tesla has.
9:38
They've done a lot of novel research around the energy sector and the humanoid robot and AI sector as well. Make sure to go to
9:44
rebellionire.comfarzad. Rebellionire.comfarzadot and that's how they'll know that I sent
9:49
you. Thank you very much. It's also a good question. I I think that there was a long layoff I guess
9:56
between the time when v13 like dropped 13.2.1 you know to v14.1.
10:03
It's been a year. Yeah. And normally you see these, you know, progressive updates throughout the year
10:10
that would lead you to, I guess, see the like incremental improvement of it, right? So, I know they had or I knew
10:19
that they had to be working on something pretty damn good if they were holding off on dropping like an intermission,
10:25
you know, 13.3, something like that. Yeah. Um, does the way that V14 works
10:32
surprise me? Not really. I mean, we saw the writing on the wall at least last year. The robo taxi version obviously
10:40
solved a lot of these things in the local like Austin environment. And to me, if they were waiting this long to
10:46
release something, they clearly were doing something inside in, you know, in internally that would get us to this
10:53
point. Now, it's just it's different to it's one thing to expect it and it's a different thing to use it.
10:58
Yeah. And even though I expected it, I didn't expect it to
11:05
work so seamlessly. Like the Mad Max mode is just a complete like total shift in the
11:11
way that the car the car just acts and drives. Before, you know, V13 didn't
11:16
make a lot of mistakes. It got you point A to B except for the last like two, you know, mile or 2% of the drive where
Implications of China's Control Over Key Technologies
11:23
you're like parking in the parking lot or like leaving your driveway. Like that was a well-known thing that they didn't implement. But it's all those like
11:29
little things in the rest of the drive that I thought V13 did a good job of that this does an even better job of and
11:36
you don't even think it's possible that the car can do a better job of it. I thought it would pick up the parking. I
11:42
thought it would pick up the driving, the drop off, all of like that stuff that Robo Taxi needs. I thought maybe
11:47
they would solve some like weird intervention stuff that was, you know, plaguing V13 with weird intersections,
11:54
things like that. But did I expect the car to just like click the blinker on for 2 seconds, make like three lane
12:00
changes to get out of the way of a cab, and then like get back in the right lane? Like, no. I don't think anyone
12:05
could have seen that coming. Um, you know, except the internal Tesla team who has been building it.
12:12
I think what's interesting about that comment, it's like, you know what goes through my mind? It's it's not just what it does, right? Like
12:20
like there is there is 10,000 things that a car has to do to be a self-driving car, but the
12:25
quality of execution of those things is what's really evident in this in this
12:31
thing. It's like it's it's a like tell me if this is a fair way of characterizing this. This drives like
12:37
the top 10% of drivers in New York. Is that fair? I I'd say that that's a pretty accurate
12:44
representation. Now, are there better drivers? Absolutely. Um,
12:50
but it definitely drives better than your average cab or Uber driver. U, I'd say it's probably in the top 70 75th.
12:56
It's like 75th percent. Top 25. Yeah, top 25, you know. And, uh, in the
13:02
video I mentioned this, uh, it may have gotten speed up. I can't remember. We talked a little bit about localized
13:07
models. I think we sped it up. Uh, so the the piece didn't the clip didn't make the video, but the the last thing
13:14
to me is localization of models for like acute scenarios that only happen in New
13:20
York. Like the navigation type issue where you have like a highway below a highway and
13:27
there's just like three right turn lanes that are divided by like a striped line. Like you don't see these scenarios
13:32
anywhere else. Now, does the car do anything unsafe? Like is there any reason to take over for that and it will
The US Response and Strategic Considerations
13:37
just like reroute? Not really. Especially not if the car is like you're in the back seat and it's just driving
13:43
you around, right? But I drive on that like vioaduct
13:48
over to uh 47th Street every 3 days. I know the way the car should go and of
13:55
course like I'm hyperritical when it comes to it making those dumb mistakes because I would never do that.
14:01
I also couldn't drive as smooth as the car. So, you know, if FSD could criticize me back, I'm sure that they
14:07
would make fun of me for slamming the brakes and like looking over my shoulder like 15 times before like making a lane
14:13
change. I mean, I'm not perfect driver either. I'm I'm not going to say that.
14:18
Yeah, that's super fair. Um, yeah, that that's I almost feel like, you know, I wonder
14:24
the approach that they take to solve for that hyper localization thing. I wonder if that's just going to be emergent
14:30
behavior from the AI. Will the AI just like be like, "Okay, this is the obvious thing to do here because I have a
14:35
superhuman brain." But if if it doesn't do that, then like you said, like hyper hyper localization of of executing
14:42
certain things within the context of your car being able to do everything else just fine can't be that hard of a
14:47
problem to solve. It's it's something they will do as they
14:52
launch a robo taxi network within each given city. like they'll have to solve
14:58
unique problems that only exist in Boston or in New York. And even though
15:03
the car can navigate those situations just fine, they don't want to just navigate them. They don't want to make a
15:09
single navigation mistake because that that cost the Tesla, you know, network of uh robo taxis money. It annoys local
15:16
drivers and things like that. So, my guess is when they release robo taxing in New York, we'll start to see, you
China's Influence in Global Markets
15:23
know, that emergent behavior, whether that's some sort of like localized add-on that they provide to cars in the
15:28
network, like if you were downloading like highquality maps for an area that you were, you know, entering or if it's
15:35
just emergent for the whole model. Um, I'm I'm not sure. You know, that sounds like something that hardware 5,
15:41
whatever. You know, we get to that sounds like something that they would tout as like the defining feature of
15:46
that, but who who really knows? You know, it's all speculation. Do you think um you know, you mentioned
15:51
robo tax in New York? Like, do you think that Tesla will do robo tax in New York?
15:56
And if you think so, when? Huh? That's a hard-hitting question, too. I mean, I saw that they I saw they
16:04
were they were hiring for uh for like testing drivers in Brooklyn recently.
16:10
So, I I mean, I think it's a foregone conclusion that they're going to try. Does it Does it mean that it's going to
16:16
be an imminent release? Who knows? I'd say maybe within the year. It's October
16:22
26, 25. I'd say maybe like Christmas of next year. Seems pretty reasonable for them to like full scale roll it out, no
16:30
drivers. Um, you know, it could change. I'm I'm surprised they haven't dropped the safety drivers in in Texas yet. And
16:37
I think once that happens, it will tell us a lot about what they plan to do in in other uh subm markets with it. Um,
16:46
yeah. So, based on what you experienced in New York then, are you are you of the mind that like Tesla would be ready to drop
16:52
the this the uh the safety rider in places like Austin? Like, is that why you made that comment?
16:59
I I mean I've seen a lot of videos that people have made and the intervention data um is I mean the videos I've seen
17:05
of interventions are are few and far between. Have there been some wonky situations I saw when the the service
17:11
first rolled out? Sure. Do I think it's time for them to drop the safety drivers?
17:16
It's a question I really can't answer. You know, only the Tesla team with all this data can really answer that. if
17:24
it's safe, if they have the uh the data that backs it up, then then they should.
17:29
And if they don't have that yet, then they should keep working towards the time they do.
17:34
Um, yeah. If you were to take the average New Yorker that you know, and you put them behind the Okay, if you were to ask
17:40
them, hey, I have a car that can drive just like you in the city. What would be their reaction? [ __ ] That's the immediate reaction.
17:49
And then I also would say I don't have a lot of friends who are even willing to drive in men in
17:57
it's I mean it's just not a fun place to drive for the most part. People Uber they take public transit. It sucks. It
18:04
sucks. I only drive in the city like in Manhattan core when I have to and that's
18:10
cuz I like live in Manhattan core. But do I like get in my car and enjoy
18:16
driving to like pick up dinner like you would do if you were in, you know, suburban America? Like absolutely not.
18:22
Like Yeah. You know, I subject myself to torture when it comes to making the videos. And
18:27
I and I'm very open about it in the videos and super sarcastic about it. Yeah. And I always need a nap after I finish
18:34
filming one. But I don't go out of my way to do that on a regular basis unless the car is capable of doing it on its
18:40
own. And you know, V13 could do it and and everything, but yeah, you have to
18:46
have a little bit of patience, I think, for it to to to drive through the intersection when it you know, it gets
18:52
stuck because the people don't ever stop coming and and things like that. And V14
18:57
so far, I mean, I've had limited testing so far, but it's it's seems to have at
19:03
least improved a lot of like the the quality of life stuff, and I just hope that our Model X gets it today. Uh,
19:09
yeah. You know, wait, waiting patiently. I do wonder if, you know, like things like
19:15
V14, you know, if if V14 drives as good as it
19:20
did on y'all's drive all the time, if not better, because, you know, like is that going to
19:26
encourage people like you and others in New York to want to get out more? And not maybe not just buy a Tesla, but like
19:32
I mean, I guess people use taxis and the subway and stuff and all that stuff already. So, it would just become a new form of transportation that people might
19:38
default to as long as it does it stressfree and it's convenient, right? That's really the thing it has to solve for. I I think the the the best use case, you
Potential Future Scenarios and Strategic Moves
19:47
know, is the car you leave you leave your driveway or your garage or
19:52
whatever, the car drives you where it needs to go. The problem is New York
19:57
City, there's no street parking. And if there is, it's expensive or you have to walk 10 blocks because you couldn't find
20:04
a spot. You know, most of the times you just get in an Uber because you just don't want to deal with parking
20:09
somewhere. The real magic I think of whatever version we get this in is going
20:15
to be like a long form version of Banish where the car drops you off somewhere
20:21
and drives away not to the parking lot to park but to drive but drives back to
20:26
your apartment building and parks itself back in the garage and then you hail it
20:32
and it comes back and gets you. That in my opinion is like the endgame.
20:37
That's a personal chauffeur that heck, and I think we talked about this during
20:42
our last video, too. I would love to pay $100 a month to park our car in the
20:48
middle of Queens and then I need the car and it drives and it comes and gets me in like 15 minutes, 20 minutes.
20:55
I do my thing and then it just returns back to its like depot. And uh that would be amazing. And and
21:03
I think it would do exactly what you're saying, which is it would get people to go out more and uh you know, Ubers are
21:09
expensive. The subway is not that safe right now. You especially at night and
21:14
uh yeah, it's it's certainly interesting uh place to be with it. It is kind of
21:19
crazy like we're we are you know like I I do wonder how much this could potentially increase the demand for
21:25
Tesla vehicles period because like if you if you really have a software like let's you know let's go let's say they
21:31
go through the validation testing let's say they go through the you know the safety testing you know they it the data
21:37
comes back with what we intuitively think is happening which is they've solved self-driving but let's let's
21:42
actually give it time and see if if it plays out or not because you know like like we're not even just talking about the drives but also like the parking and
21:49
the drop offs and stuff, right? Actually, let's talk about that a little bit. What was that experience like with V14,
21:55
the drop offs and pickups and stuff? So, we we tested it in a limited capacity because I didn't didn't want to
22:02
circle the block for, you know, an an hour to find a parking spot, but the the drop off and pickup type scenario
22:09
seemed to work perfectly fine. it it pulls over in a space on the side of the road as if you were getting out of of a
22:15
cab and uh left space for the doors to open and then we continued the ride. The
China's Long-Term Strategy and Global Influence
22:22
pulling over for parking um you know it we picked one spot that was pretty
22:27
available. It parked and uh I didn't give it a chance to circle a paid New
22:32
York City garage because I didn't want to get yelled at by one of the attendants. Yeah. Um but it's it seems to be able to do it
22:38
from other people's videos. Now, is it perfect? No. I think that I saw a video
22:43
yesterday where a car drove through like an entire empty parking garage and then like parked at the top level. I was
22:50
watching it and just laughing like, "Oh man, you know, they're they're not there yet for that." But
22:56
this is the first time the car has even attempted to park in a parking garage. It's clear to me that they know like the
23:04
process to solve it and they just they're a little further behind on that than everything else. But that's okay. I
23:10
still think that the driving part of the experience is is solved. Now, full self
23:16
parking, that's a different story. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I do wonder
23:22
like, you know, that same cohort of people like if you know I am really curious to see if you're able to like,
23:30
you know, get your friends like the people that's, you know, would say, "Hey, I have a car that can drive itself." And they say [ __ ] Like if
23:36
if you were to put it in the car with you, like do you think that what they see from the car would change their minds at all? Do you think it would make
The Role of Local Economies and Partnerships
23:43
any sort of impact to them or would they be like, "Ah, it's not perfect, so I'm not going to even care that it's not perfect or I still have to pay
23:49
attention, you know, I don't really care." Like what do you think their their reactions would be?
23:54
Depends on the person. Um, you know, some people are just hyper stubborn about everything, you know, and still
24:00
have like iPhone 8s in, you know, 2026. Uh, that's a good idea, honestly. with the
24:05
[ __ ] way I Apple has been sucking, you know. But anyway, there go. Yeah, I know. As I record this using
24:11
continuity camera with the 17 Pro Max. There you go. Works pretty good. Not lagging. Fair enough.
24:16
Um, but I I I I think it's hard for someone to get in the car and not be
24:22
impressed at this point. Um, it's it's just it's just works for the most
24:30
part. I I think that Tesla needs to update the UI in some ways to give a
24:37
better like tutorial to the lay person who's using it. The car just updates,
24:42
all the information about full self-driving is like release notes derived right now. And if you were to get someone in a Tesla for a first time
24:49
and don't explain to them that they don't have to hold the wheel and that they just like need to look at the road,
24:55
most people would like grab the wheel by accident or be confused or not understand how to like use the drop off
25:01
and pickup thing. It's easy for me because, you know, I'm active on on X and I
25:08
followed this stuff for years and it's not a problem, but it's you have to
25:13
explain it to people initially. And if you don't do that, you're going to that's why I think the adoption rate's
25:19
not necessarily that great. If I demo it for people, I think they're super impressed. If I
25:25
explain how to use it and then they use it, it's always if it's not always a
25:30
positive experience, it's almost always a positive experience. But if you're just gonna sell a car and be like your car drives itself and you
25:37
don't like explain why the full self driving button just like changed from a press and hold to a tap and all the new
25:43
things that it does without just, you know, like the release notes are just not enough. They need like uh is a good
25:49
example. When Apple just released liquid glass, they have like a little like tutorial saying like this is liquid
25:56
glass. This is why you should this is like why it's better. This is what you should do to like navigate this new
26:02
interface. I don't know why Tesla doesn't do that. I don't know why it tells me when I'm not paying attention
26:09
to the road, it shows a symbol of me holding the yolk. Why isn't it a picture of your eyes looking at the road?
26:16
there's just like some inconsistencies with the with the messaging, I think, and I've been critical of that, too,
26:22
that if they fixed that, I think the adoption rate would go up. I think people would use it more. I think it'd be less confusing. And even though the
26:28
software is like working really good, people aren't necessarily like well educated enough to to like let it do its
26:35
thing. Um, and yeah, that's that's certainly an issue. That's a fascinating point. It's like the there's too much friction for the
26:42
non-technical there. Like it's uh I mean that and I I
26:47
hear this, you know, I hear this from from many people too. It's like like it it's just why aren't they advertising
26:54
this, you know, this capability? Why aren't they doing more to try and gain adoption? I wonder if like, you know,
27:02
sometimes Tesla does some illogical [ __ ] and I'm like, didn't they fire their entire like PR team? Like they don't have one anymore,
27:09
right? Like this this is exactly have for a long time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I do. You know, I think that I
27:16
think that's a very interesting point. I do wonder like if let's say my gut still
27:22
tells me like the the car, it's not until we get to unsupervised
27:28
that I don't think this thing really takes off because even supervised, it's kind of like it kind of creates this awkward layer to the for the
27:35
non-technical that says, "Well, no, the car drives, but you still have to pay attention." And then the the average person's like,
27:41
"Why?" So, just let me drive. Like, why? You know, that's kind of what my dad says. My dad's like, I don't really turn
27:47
on FSC that much because I could just drive better. Now, if he gets FS14, well, he has a hardware with three vehicle, so I don't know if he's going
27:52
to get V14 on there ever. We'll have to figure that out. That's another thing to work through. Yeah, it's a whole different conversation. Uh, but um
28:00
but you know, if he had V14, I'd be curious to see like, okay, cuz my dad would be a very good proxy. Like, are
28:05
you going to use FSD now all the time? And if you're still like, "No, I still want to be in control." Then in reality,
28:11
efficacy doesn't really take off until it becomes unsupervised where it's like, "I don't even need you." Right.
28:17
Yeah. But the question or I think for the normal person is like, is it how is
28:22
it quantifiable to explain to someone like how much better V14 is versus V13?
28:28
In my opinion, the release notes don't do it justice. Sure, it tells you the car parks. It shows you like Mad Max
28:35
mode. That's awesome. That that's really great stuff. But to the normal person, what does supervising the vehicle really
28:42
even mean? Yeah. To me, like I've developed an I've developed like a
28:47
it's almost like different than driving at that point. You know, your focus level is just different. The what you're looking for is different. You learn to
28:54
like read and react to the car's behavior different. And which is why in a lot of my videos, my arms are like
28:59
crossed, you know, I'm I'm hanging back. It's easy to, you know, tell when the car is going to make those those
29:06
mistakes, but the lay person who just uses the software doesn't understand,
29:12
okay, well, supervising means this or it means that. They just think, well, the car is driving and I need to provide the
29:18
same quantity of attention that I would if I was holding the steering wheel. And it's it's a very different kind of
29:24
focus. I'm not saying don't pay attention, but like if I look to the left to admire like the, you know, the
29:30
scenery for 20 seconds, as long as the car doesn't beep at me and I'm like still paying attention, that's like
29:36
acceptable supervising behavior, right? And it's just different. And Tesla
29:41
doesn't do a good job of explaining that. Their documentation doesn't prompt you to wonder why the software is better
29:47
now than it was yesterday. and they don't do a good job of like instilling confidence in the normal people to turn
29:53
the system on and and you know really get what they're doing and uh somehow
29:59
it's become like the Tesla influencer's job to explain that which to me is like
30:05
is bad. I love the robo taxi interface like that
30:10
to me feels like a much closer to like polished experience for someone who's just getting into a car that drives
30:16
itself. They need to get to that point with the customer cars. The car should
30:21
explain to you when you first get in. You should press this like it literally like have a tutorial overlay mode that
30:28
says like you press this button. This green dot here means the cameras are watching what you're doing. This yellow
30:34
dot tells you that the mics are listening for, you know, blah blah blah blah blah. And then like you say, okay,
30:40
acknowledge. And then there's like a training wheels mode at the beginning that says this is what you should do when this
30:46
happens or that happens. I just don't get why they don't do that. It's so easy. It's like the car drives
30:52
itself. Like they can't put a [ __ ] overlay that says like this is a tutorial mode. It's
30:57
so true. I just don't get it. Yeah. I get heated over this cuz it's so stupid.
31:02
Hell. I mean it it really I think the point that like you you're transitioning away
31:09
from driving and more to like it's almost like piloting a plane on autopilot,
31:14
right? You know, when when I talked to Chuck Cook, uh he's a pilot and he like he
31:19
very commonly uh says that, you know, being behind the steering wheel and pedal of a car on on
31:26
self-driving is very similar to a plane on autopilot. You're just you're just
31:31
giving it very loose instructions like go here and then the the car or the plane just
31:38
takes you there and you're just making sure that the car the plane is doing the right stuff to get you there,
31:44
you know? Yeah. But it it does like to me it's like this is like a such a um
31:50
such an Elon thing to do which is like just don't worry about the in between step, worry worry about the end step.
31:56
And so the in between step is like such a like a weird like just odd
32:03
combination of just things that aren't really optimized to deliver on the unbelievable technology that you've just
32:09
put together, you know. Um, so I do wonder there is friction when you look at the like base
32:17
software that they release from the Tesla team and the full self-driving version that gets enabled in terms of
32:24
like it's clear to me when the like base software team adds features like they're
32:31
clearly organized in the menus. So true. And then it feels like the AI team is just a
32:36
bunch of like nerds in a back room, you know? They're like, "Oh my god, programming the computer. It's working
32:42
so good, you know, and they're like, "Oh my god, the car drives itself." But no one thinks like, "Oh, like we should
32:48
like fix the graphics so that it like makes sense to people." Yeah. They'll just be like, "Oh my god, the car drives better." Like I I I don't
32:55
know. It it's so stupid, but it's so it's so easy to fix.
33:00
If you're going to give someone like a demo and like, you know, expend all this, you know, social c like so I don't
33:06
know if it's social capital. They give free demos out and then they don't explain how it works. Yeah.
33:11
I don't know. No, I'm with you, dude. I'm with you. I mean, that's such a good point. That's such a good point. I do wonder like now
33:17
that it's at the level that it's at now, it's like you can't, you know, if like let's say that the the the the retail
33:23
investing community, even the institutional investing community, they're going to see the capability of E14 and they're going to be like, why
33:28
isn't this at 100% adoption in the US? How come how come like not everybody who
33:34
owns a Tesla that's capable of doing this should have this downloaded in their car? Why is that not the case?
33:39
That needs to be the question. It's like it needs to be at least 80% adoption rate in the United States with V14. No
33:46
question. Absolutely no question. It's still sparse that when I like look over when I'm driving that I see someone
33:53
like on the Long Island Expressway with an enabled and it's often times
33:59
more time it's often more young people who have it enabled and it's a lot more
34:04
predominantly male and you never see the Uber drivers with it enabled. You never
34:10
see older people with it enabled. And a lot of that to me is just like you're
34:15
techy, it makes sense. You don't really have to think too hard about it. And uh
34:20
it should have higher adoption. And a lot of it starts with education, not even with the quality of the software
34:26
right now. Yeah, I do. But I do wonder like how much of that too it's like, hey, it made a mistake that one time, so
34:33
I don't trust it anymore. And maybe your your and I's like tolerance for these
34:38
like minor things that happen. Perhaps the layman is like, "No, no, no. If you're going to drive, you're going to drive. Like I don't want to drive. But
34:44
if you if I can't trust you, if I can't trust you one out of a hundred times, I'm not I'm not going to let you do it."
34:49
You know? So I do wonder. Yeah, that's a that's a tough gray area. I I guess I've developed a a pretty high
34:57
level of trust. I probably at this point have 20,000 miles on full self-driving
35:02
over the past like two years in in the city. A combination of the city, Long Island,
35:08
you know, and the adjacent areas outside and we drive back and forth to like the Hamptons that the car handles 100% of
35:15
the driving. Every single time we leave our apartment, it goes through the tunnel, you know, Midtown tunnel. It
35:21
drives all the way out there. It we get to the gate for the house. I take over and I charge the car and
35:28
that's it. So I have thousands of miles doing that and uh th that those are like
35:33
three and a half hour drives that could be in bumper-to-bumper traffic for an hour and 25 minutes. It's great. It's
35:41
the car rarely makes a mistake there. And if it did make a mistake, like cutting out of the HOV lane, you know,
35:47
unnecessarily or something like that, the amount of fatigue that it reduces
35:53
far outweighs the potential for it to even make a mistake or two. That's why you supervise the system. You're not
35:59
meant to go to sleep. But that doesn't mean I need to be like staring like, you know, like this the whole ride. Like,
36:05
no. That's just not the point anymore. People don't get that though. I keep saying it, you know. I don't
36:12
think people understand the difference between supervising and driving. And they say that, oh, why don't I just
36:18
drive? Well, that that's not the same thing as supervising. You you just it's
36:24
a different level of of like mental and physical involvement. Goes back to your initial point. It's a
36:30
it's a different thing. Like Tesla Tesla owners no long we're not we're not we
36:36
don't have to be drivers anymore. Truly, right? We don't have to be drivers anymore. Like, and it sounds insane to say, like
36:41
the the layman will watch this video. Look, look at these two retards. Look at these two retards saying the craziest
36:47
[ __ ] I've ever heard. What are these guys saying? These two hairy guys. Like, what are they even talking about?
36:53
And it's like just I'm at the point now where like it's very easy to tell somebody just try yourself. Just just go
36:59
try it. Just go try it. Like don't even take my word for it. Just hop in a car with V13,
37:04
ideally V14 if it goes wide wide in the next couple weeks. just try it yourself,
37:10
you know, and it's I think we're at the point we're at that point now. And and I do wonder like, you know, kind of going
37:16
back to some of the talk things we talked about. It's like, hey, is it going to help demand of the vehicles? Like I would be shocked if it doesn't
37:22
have a material impact in the next 3 to 6 months. Like it has to it's it's way too good of a capability for this to go
37:28
under the radar. It makes no sense anymore for it to be like just in the background. They're
The Impact of Chinese Brands in Europe
37:34
going to have to solve what I consider to be their second biggest issue behind education and that's fragmentation of
37:40
the of their I guess full self-driving ecosystem right now. Like
37:46
the update the process which cars get updated is ridiculous. And the fact that
37:52
people have to beg for the update and plea, you know, on Twitter and the whole the fact that the dirty Tesla,
37:57
by the way, DM DM dirty dirty Tesla if you need the latest update. Go to dirty Tesla onx and DM him. He will get you
38:04
the update. Got it. Yeah, Chris got you. He's got you. The fact that that joke even exists, that Tesla acknowledges its existence
38:12
tells you everything you need to know. Like, why is why does it roll in such
38:17
arbitrary like archaic way? Why does the Cybert truck get left out? I understand
38:22
like it's an engineering challenge, right? That's definitely why. But why is that left out? What happens if you buy a
38:29
used Tesla that happens to have hardware 3 and you think you're getting the performance of a hardware 4 car that has
38:36
V14? There's just a lot of fragmentation I guess that's been created now. That's in
38:43
part because technology has improved and you know this is like an issue that plagued plagues Android more than any
38:49
other thing I can think of. But they they have to solve this with the education problem. You have to
38:55
explain to people in a way that makes sense, this version of this car doesn't have this version, but only these ones
39:02
have that version. And you know, they may upgrade hardware 3 to hardware 4. We
39:08
don't really know what they're going to do yet. I saw a thing yesterday Elon tweeted and said, or someone said, Elon
39:14
hasn't tweeted about hardware 3 in like 10 months. I mean, he did explicitly say on the one call that said, "Anybody who bought FSD
39:21
on hardware 3 will get an upgrade." Right. I But is that the computer? Is that the cameras? Is it both?
39:27
Great question. Is it hardware five they're going to get? Yeah, they don't really give much
39:32
communication towards it. And uh you know that's that's a interesting thing.
39:38
It's it's just all goes back to like their public perception and uh
39:43
if they can get rid of the fragmentation or at least explain the fragmentation and they can make it more
39:49
straightforward for people to understand the adoption rate will shoot up because they will the software is already that
39:55
good. Doesn't need to be that much better for the adoption rate to go up. But the rest of the experience needs to improve
40:02
and uh we'll see. I I'll quit my job and and go work for them if they'll if they'll let me help
40:07
with it. If somebody from Elon, I know you watch this every day religiously. This is the only show you watch. Hit up Jordan right
40:14
now. Go hit him up at H Leads on X and Savage Junkie 96, not 69,96 on YouTube.
40:22
Go make sure you check him out. You know, it's crazy like um what was I going to say? like the the
40:29
hardware 3 thing is such a fascinating discussion because once V14
40:36
like really goes wide and I don't see why they can't go unsupervised in a lot of situations with V14 just based on the
40:43
early videos again we have to wait for more data to come through but like V14 has been out in the wild for like a week
China's Influence in the US and Higher Education
40:48
now and we haven't seen seen one situation of a of a safety critical takeover
40:53
usually we see we would see something by now like you know Chris or Omar or or Sawyer or somebody. Chuck would have
40:59
shown, hey, look at I had to take over here, but like we haven't seen that from anybody yet.
41:05
I think Chuck disengaged. He was like making his left turn, but you know, I question if the car would have been
41:11
fine. He said it was it was like a motorcycle. Uh yeah, there's one video. That's it.
41:17
But normally there's like nonetheless there's like 50. Yeah, exactly. And then, you know, 50
41:22
amongst like the amount of miles that are out there, you know, it's probably it's probably like not that much. But even then,
41:28
that really drives point the point drives home the point like, hey, if we're at the point where there's going
41:34
to be a pathway for them to make this unsupervised, then you like your point is so so true
41:39
because an unsupervised car becomes significantly more valuable than one you
41:44
supervise. Because if you can just get a car, hop in there, and it just takes you from point A to point B, you don't even
41:50
have to worry about it. You're already like living in a world where you have transportation as a service.
41:57
You don't even really have driving because it's like the ex even the existing framework, you pay Tesla, I
42:03
don't know, 400 bucks a month for a lease or whatever, 500 bucks a month for finance or 400 bucks, whatever. Pick a
The Asymmetry in US-China Knowledge
42:09
number. Then you pay for the insurance, then you pay for, you know, your maintenance and whatever. And then that
42:15
payment structure allows you the ability to get in a transportation unit where
42:21
you just press a button and it takes you where you want to go, right? I don't it's it's do we even need
42:26
to own the cars anymore? Like do we I I ask myself that question like what's the point, you know,
Chinese Automakers at the Munich Auto Show
42:33
for someone in New York? I mean that's a that's a very very very good question. Yeah. We pay almost 800 bucks a month
42:39
for our garage. What? Yeah. Yeah, it's crazy. In Manhattan, $800 a month.
42:47
Yeah, that's Midtown Manhattan pricing for for a Model X because technically it's an oversized vehicle, too.
42:53
We thought of getting a Cybert truck. It doesn't even fit in the garage, but this is a single unit garage or is it
42:59
like shared with other cars? It's It's for our apartment building. For your apartment building. Okay.
China's Strategic Moves and the Belt and Road Initiative
43:04
But it's an elevator garage and there's spots in the you know, there's probably 50 spots in the garage and anyone can
43:10
park in the garage. You know, they they have spots you can just lease from if you're like walking from the street.
43:16
I see. But, uh, yeah, it's I think it's like 765 770 at this point for for the
43:22
parking spot for the car. It could buy another It's such a no-brainer. I I want to get a Model Y just to have a
43:29
second car. There's no There's no way on planet Earth I would spend almost, you know, $2,000 a month in parking. It's th
43:38
this problem of of like the parking in New York City is real. And that's also why I would love if I could just park
43:44
the car in Queens for a hundred bucks and just have it come get me.
43:50
So, isn't that the market price for unsupervised right there? 800 bucks a month.
43:56
In New York, it is. I don't know if you can charge the price differently elsewhere, but you know, but like it it should be
44:03
somewhere between it's somewhere between realistically somewhere between 300 and 600 bucks. Realistically,
44:09
if you're going to say, "Hey, this car you don't have to park anymore in your garage. It just kind of comes gets you whenever you need it and you're going to
44:15
save $800 a month of in parking and you just pay 300 bucks or 400 bucks for
44:20
unsupervised, you know, 300 bucks for unsupervised and then a h 100red bucks a month for a far away lot like in Queens
The Game of Go and China's Long-Term Strategy
44:26
like you said a month or whatever that number is. That's 400 bucks. You just saved 50% in parking costs and you don't
44:33
have to worry. Do you know like it's such a no-brainer and you save half and you're and Tesla's getting 300 bucks a
44:38
month in unsupervised which is three times more than supervised. Yeah, I
44:44
if they if they can reliably deliver the car to my apartment without it, you
44:49
know, getting stuck somewhere. Yeah, I would sign up for that and forego the garage cost tomorrow.
44:56
And my garage, the guys are great. I love the garage. You know, if they're if they end up watching this video, like,
45:01
sorry, don't take offense. I'm sure they won't be. We still love you.
45:07
But but it'd be great if I didn't have to park in the garage. Like there have been a couple times now where, you know, they've dinged up the rims. You know,
The Hundred Years of Humiliation
45:13
[ __ ] always goes wrong in the garages. My uh I had a friend who they dropped they dropped a lift on his car and he
45:21
he had a like an Audi. They dropped the lift on the car. They destroyed the hood of the car. He actually ended up getting
45:26
a Model S instead cuz it has sentry mode and and you can record this, you know,
45:32
now. And the scenarios are like, well, now they see the sentry mode gets turned on. They're a little more careful
45:37
with the cars. But um yeah, it's crazy. It's pretty
45:42
crazy. You know, the garage system in New York, they damage your car and they kind of just say like, "Oops, sorry."
45:48
Like, "It wasn't us." Of course. Of course it wasn't. I I can't prove this.
45:55
Dang. That's crazy. That's crazy. That is crazy. Yeah. Yeah, man. Um, I look forward to uh like
46:03
seeing your feedback on when you get it to the model on the Model X V14 because that's a significantly bigger vehicle.
46:10
Yeah. But, uh, your videos on the Model X with V14 are going to be bangers because that's a that's a big car
46:16
in a very congested traffic situation in Manhattan. So, you have a so you already
Comparing US and Chinese Cultural Motivations
46:21
have a very difficult driving environment, but then on top of that, you're going to add a bigger vehicle with a Model X, which is going to make
46:27
the maneuvering even more intense. and more precise. You have to be more precise and more just more careful
46:33
because you're just taking up more real estate on the road. Um, but if it performs just as good as the Model Y.
46:39
So, let me have you have you been able to test V13 on the Model X versus a Model Y like V13. So, what what what are
46:45
the major differences if any? I I've had a very good experience with the Model X. Let's say that to start.
46:52
And we also are an early hardware for Model X. So, if they've done any like some anything under the hood since since
46:59
the, you know, advent of hardware 4, like I can't speak for the later 2026 Model X's and stuff, but comparatively,
47:08
it's it's not obvious, but you can definitely tell that they train the model on the smaller car. Um, they we've
47:17
I definitely noticed like some more like micro adjustments in like tight turning scenarios with the X than I do with the
47:25
Y. It's just clearer to me like sometimes you would get, especially on V13, you would like get to an
47:30
intersection and then instead of the car like completing the turn perfectly, sometimes you would see the wheel like
47:36
turn a little bit back and then a little back to just like clear the curb or something like that. And I mean, my
47:43
experience with the model with the Y is pretty limited, but I never really noticed any of that with the with the Y.
47:49
I didn't see that really often in videos. I think that other creators who have the S or the X have documented
The Role of Artificial Intelligence in US-China Competition
47:57
these micro adjustments, and I I expect to see them, you know, with the V14.
48:03
It's it's not a problem by any stretch of the imagination, but I expect to see it. Um, and hopefully I'll find out
48:11
soon. It seems like the first wave went out last night to a very small group of people.
48:16
Uh, you know, I saw Dan uh got it on his Model S Plaid and um, you know, maybe
48:22
maybe they'll add me to EA finally and I can I can finally test it with the rest of the people um before, you know,
48:29
before it goes wide. But yeah, I think it will be fine. It's Yeah, the Cybertruck's a different animal,
48:36
though. I mean they clearly they clearly need a completely different model for for that to work perfectly.
48:41
Yeah. Real world steering was the thing that uh Elon mentioned on X one of replies to one of to one of the posts
48:47
out there and Ashok said the leader of AI he said next month but then he deleted the post.
48:53
I know. I saw that. So we know damn well it's not going to be next month. It's going to be this month. Just kidding. It's probably going to be
48:59
like March or April of next year. Oh my god. And that's I'm excited for that. Um,
49:04
that hurts their sales. Sorry, but that hurts the sales for the Cybertruck. I know. I know, man. I I really
49:11
Doesn't help. I think I think that Cybertruck line is going to they're going to rescue it with a with a van, the Cyber Van. They're
49:18
they're going to they're going to crank start cranking that thing probably in the next couple quarters. And that thing's going to like the three row SUV version, you
49:23
mean? For sure. I mean, it was there was a sketch or like a model of it on Bronze's cabinet,
49:29
right? 100%. Yeah. They were like they were doing uh they were doing like a uh it was like a clay model of the cyber cab
49:35
and then they had a some sort of like shelf and then at the top of the shelf you could see like a like a cyber van
49:41
style thing. That thing that thing is going to be all cuz the cyber dude the cybert truck's driving dynamics is like
49:47
Have you ever driven one? Yeah. I've driven I've driven them a few times. Bro, they're insane. It's unbelievable. It's like it's
49:53
impossible to describe how unbelievable that car is to drive. But they're not just better than the X.
49:58
Oh yeah. And the packaging of it is like just so great. The packaging of that vehicle, if that's turned into a van,
50:05
you will easily have room for three massive rows and a nicely sized trunk.
The Urgency of Technological Advancement in the US
50:12
It will be like a what's that? It's like an Escalade or even what's what's that one? It's like a Sequoia type.
50:18
Um the Tahoe like these like monster. Yeah, it's like a Lincoln Navigator. Exactly.
50:24
Those were like uh those were like buses. Exactly. Yeah. Like giant giant things.
50:30
But then you have pretty easy for them to change it too. It's just Yeah, it would be. I mean, it's probably cheaper to make if you
50:35
think about it. They don't have to deal with like the whole like tunnel cover and you know they probably could reduce the
50:40
towing capacity significantly because people aren't using an SUV in that in that same way. And
50:46
for sure, it's just different. I think it would sell incredibly well. I wonder if they
50:52
would keep the design like exactly the same and just like bump the back up or if they they'll like try to make it a
50:58
little more conventional so that it's not so divisive. If they do that, they're going to sell I mean they're going to sell hundreds of thousands of
51:04
them. Well, I think just just removing the point on the top like just just having it so it goes up
The Impact of Chinese Electric Vehicles
51:11
and then across and then down like more flat in the back and just having it complete in the back,
51:16
you know, just have it just uh go across and just maybe have I it's just having it not be a point at the top
51:23
is going to be everything. It's going to completely change the character of of the car. I have a I pillar deleted my uh
51:30
the the sort of the you know the the pointy shape on the top of the truck and the truck looks so much better without
51:37
without that being obvious and just blending in with the glass. I don't know why like we're uh we're doing that when I have a copy of the
51:43
little windup toy on my desk. That's awesome. There you go.
51:48
That's hilarious. Yeah, dude. Like you're right across came across. Yeah, exactly. And then you just get rid
51:55
of the point and then Yeah. sell like gang busters. They will definitely do that. I I would be shocked
52:00
if they don't do that. Yeah, me too. Um got there. Do we need to hit anything else before uh before we let you go?
52:08
I think that's probably it. Let's just hope V14.2 fixes whatever little brake stuttering
52:14
there's left. Yeah, you know, they sort out the little ticky tack stuff and by Christmas,
52:21
uh you know, they're they're rolling out unsupervised to more cities. I think that's hopefully uh you know where we
52:28
should be. Yeah. See when and then uh as soon as you get on the X, you'll be able to put a video up
52:34
relatively quick once you got V14. Yeah, I have a I have a video planned. That's interesting. I'll give a little
52:40
preview for my idea, which is we're going to leave Manhattan. We're during rush hour and we're going
52:46
to drive to JFK and then we're going to we're going to loop through every single terminal of
52:51
JFK in pickup or drop off mode and I'm going to see how it does at dropping people off at the different terminals
52:58
departures and if it can make its way off the curb and navigate JFK in
53:03
construction and then uh I may take the Cross Island and and then go to LaGuardia on the same
53:09
drive and do the same thing. Um, and then take the 59 Street Bridge back into the city. That's going to be like a
53:15
three-hour adventure. And uh that's a monster drive. Yeah, it's it's not going to be it's not
53:22
going to be any fun. No, but that's what I'm going to do. That will be the first drive when I get it.
53:27
So, uh, you know, let's let's see how it goes. I'm I'm very interested to see see how that works.
53:33
JFK sucks. So, I mean, LaGuardia is pretty good now, but we'll see.
53:39
JFK is no fun, dude. That's crazy there. You know what's what's the one drive when we used
53:45
to live in PA, dude? Like I just remember anytime we would start driving past uh like like the Newark airport
53:52
exit and we start getting into like okay like like northeast Jersey going into like I'm like I could just start start
53:58
getting anxiety cuz these [ __ ] start going like this on the road. Like it's just something about like that that that Newark airport
54:04
exit and that before and after just the road completely changes. Yeah. You know. Yeah,
54:10
the Holland tunnel entrance, all those like really sketchy areas. I just need
54:16
I need a lot of time in the car. I need nothing to do. And I also like need to
54:21
not necessarily care about, you know, like what what happens like it's going to it could route wrong. I could hit a
54:27
pothole. I just got to let it do its thing. Hopefully, it doesn't do anything wrong. I think we'll be good this time around,
54:33
but we'll see. It's such a great test. I mean, that that is the kind of test that drives home the point. If if the Model X can do
54:39
that that circuit, Manhattan, JFK, LaGuardia, and if it can do drop offs,
54:45
pickups, no problem. All the all the interchanges, everything, navigating through rush hour.
54:53
Come on. We'll see. We'll see what happens. We'll see the result. Where can people watch it? Hopefully, I get it tonight. Yeah. When can people watch it once it
54:59
comes out? Yeah, it will be on my YouTube at Savage Junkie 96 and it will be on my ex which
55:05
is fleets hle.
55:11
I don't know. I never changed it. I should have but now it's too late.
55:16
It's clever. It's clever. It's clever. You know, now you can buy uh handles now on X if you're a business. I saw that's a brand new thing and I'll
55:24
keep it forever. At this point, I'm locked in with the YouTube and with the uh with the X handle,
55:29
whatever. Yeah, lock it in. We'll see. Excited. Well, thank you for having me on. It was
55:35
good to speak with you as always. As always. Yeah. And hopefully Penn State turns it around. They won't.
55:41
It's [ __ ] lost. It's over.
