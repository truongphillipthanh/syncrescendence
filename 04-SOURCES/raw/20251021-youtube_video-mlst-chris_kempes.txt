The Universal Hierarchy of Life - Prof. Chris Kempes [SFI]
3,406 views  Oct 25, 2025
"What is life?" - asks Chris Kempes, a professor at the Santa Fe Institute.

Dr. Keith Duggar (interviewer) who is often a co-interviewer on MLST — obtained his Ph.D from MIT and has done stints at IBM research, Wall Street, and Microsoft.

Chris explains that scientists are moving beyond a purely Earth-based, biological view and are searching for a universal theory of life that could apply to anything, anywhere in the universe. He proposes that things we don't normally consider "alive"—like human culture, language, or even artificial intelligence; could be seen as life forms existing on different "substrates".

To understand this, Chris presents a fascinating three-level framework:

Materials: The physical stuff life is made of. He argues this could be incredibly diverse across the universe, and we shouldn't expect alien life to share our biochemistry.

Constraints: The universal laws of physics (like gravity or diffusion) that all life must obey, regardless of what it's made of. This is where different life forms start to look more similar.

Principles: At the highest level are abstract principles like evolution and learning. Chris suggests these computational or "optimization" rules are what truly define a living system.

A key idea is "convergence" – using the example of the eye. It's such a complex organ that you'd think it evolved only once. However, eyes evolved many separate times across different species. This is because the physics of light provides a clear "target", and evolution found similar solutions to the problem of seeing, even with different starting materials.

Introduction to Chris Kempes and the Santa Fe Institute
0:00
The eye is so complicated, maybe it only gets discovered once and then everything that has an eye has a common ancestor.
0:07
Not true. Um, eyes evolve many times. There are differences in the details of
0:13
eyes um, in terms of how exactly they see and how they're constructed and slightly what they're made of and so
0:18
forth, but in some notion they're all doing the same sort of physics. MLST is supported by Cyber Fund.

Tom Fail. I'm the co-founder and CEO of Prolific. And uh Prolific is a human data infrastructure company. So we make
0:34
it easy for people developing frontier AI models uh and running research to get

This podcast is supported by Google. Hey folks, Steven Johnson here, co-founder
0:52
of Notebook LM. As an author, I've always been obsessed with how software could help organize ideas and make
0:58
connections. So, we built Notebook LM as an AI first tool for anyone trying to
1:04
make sense of complex information. Upload your documents and Notebook LM instantly becomes your personal expert,

1:17
So I'm a professor at the Santa Fe Institute um which is a massively interdisciplinary research institute
1:23
trying to bring together minds from across the spectrum of academia to really think about some of our hardest
1:29
problems. My own background is that I was a physicist and then I became a biohysicist and then that's taken me
1:34
into ecology and um cities and human organizations and um thinking about the
1:41
whole history of life um and also origins of life and astrobiology, right? That's that's really the SFI thing is to
1:46
try and um take a core expertise and use that as a nucleation to expand into all these different topics and areas.
1:53
And it's so interesting that you work at the Santa Fe Institute. So I spoke with David Krakow recently, very inspiring
1:58
gentleman. And what you folks are are really kind of doing is I guess you
2:04
would call it a multiddisciplinary lens on science. You were talking about three cultures in in science. So there's the
2:10
variance culture where we look at diversity and deviation, the exactitude culture where we have quite a high
2:15
resolution mapping of everything and this coarse grained abstract culture where we look for principles and even in
2:21
machine learning we have similar terms for this. We have the neats and the scruffies. How can you reconcile these
2:27
different aspects of science? Part of the inspiration for us in writing that paper was to say if we look at the history of physics which has had
The Three Cultures of Science
2:33
enormous success. Um part of that you know amazing success is that it was such
2:39
a set of easy questions in relative terms. I mean biology, the economy,
2:44
intelligence, those are all much harder questions. But for physics trying to answer relatively simple questions like
2:50
gravity and planetary motion um they had what I call the magic loop right which
2:55
is this observation leading to theory theory leading back to observation right
3:01
so people took huge sets of observations that we had tried to find regularities
3:07
tried to find simple equations that predicted those observations and then once they had those theories they would
3:13
explore them mathematically often that gave rise to new sorts of surprising predictions and then experimentalists
3:20
would go looking for those predictions, right? And then and then this loop just continued on and on um as people
3:25
uncovered most of the laws for most of the fundamental forces. And um obviously there's still open questions in physics,
3:32
but that trajectory has been really successful. And so I think our proposal in this paper was that we need to do a
3:38
similar sort of thing for biosciences and for a science of the biosphere. We need more ways to bring the huge amount
3:45
of observations we have today together with new types of theory to sort of get this loop where we're compressing what
3:52
we know into simple theories using those theories to make surprising predictions testing those with data um so forth and
3:59
so on. And so that's really the variance culture and the coar grain culture. Um in our current moment we have this new
4:04
thing that we call exactitude culture which is just the ability to model everything. Right? So Galileo didn't
4:11
have this. He didn't have the ability to um write down as an arbitrarily many
4:18
number of equations that he wanted. He couldn't um write down an agent-based model for the planets and simulate that
4:24
in a computer. He was forced to try and find these compressed mathematical representations. Um in today's world, we
4:30
can simulate huge numbers of things and make exceptionally complicated simulations. And so that's sort of a
4:37
third category, right? We have this with certain earth systems models. We have this with um very detailed models of the
4:44
economy. Um artificial intelligence is certainly in that space. And so we think each of these has trade-offs. Each of
4:51
these three cultures and we really need to find a way to sort of walk amongst the corners of that triangle to get the
4:57
best knowledge. So there are certain things course graining is best for there are other things simulation is best for.
5:03
We always need observation to test both types of knowledge. Um and that's I think where we find ourselves.
What Makes a Good Scientific Theory?
5:08
Chsky said to us that deep learning is a bit like I mean he used the term anything goes and in his estimation it
5:15
didn't kind of you know as a theory it didn't demarcate what something isn't versus what it is. I mean in your
5:22
estimation what makes a good scientific theory and what does it mean for us to actually understand something?
5:28
I mean for me it's all about compactness and compression right. So I think the
5:33
amazing thing about equations is that we can transmit them to each other quickly,
5:38
easily in small forms. Now there's a huge amount of knowledge that one requires to then decode those equations,
5:46
right? So it's not um it's not so simple like you and I might both have to spend
5:51
30 years learning all the mathematics it takes to transmit a certain sort of equation to each other. Um but once
5:58
we've done that, once we have that training, this compact form is really an easy way to transmit understanding and
6:05
knowledge. Um one of my favorite ways to test understanding is to predict um the
6:10
unseen or the unexpected. And I think that's many theorists get very excited
6:15
when they have a theory that predicts something that hasn't been seen yet because it's sort of I think what Rob
6:21
Phillips once called a dangerous prediction, right? There's no data for it yet. there's no way you could have
6:26
tuned your theory to match some old data. Um, you're making a prediction
6:32
that will either be right or wrong about something that hasn't been seen yet. But that's a real notion of understanding, I
6:39
think, to say, you know, we've never looked for this, we've never seen this, but if X is true and Y true is true,
6:45
then certainly Z must be out there. Let's go find it. Um, and I think that's a real demonstration of understanding.
The Universal Theory of Life
6:50
Um, I've just read your paper with David Krakau, multiple paths to life, and towards the end of the paper, you said
6:56
we want to have a universal theory of life. Tell me about that.
7:03
Yeah. So, it's a it's something that's been of interest for, you know, as almost as perhaps as long as as human
7:09
thought, right? What is life? How do we understand living things and so forth? Um, that question has been more and less
7:15
obvious to people over the history of science where sometimes people say, "Of course we know what life is. That's a frog. You see one there and so forth.
7:22
But what we're really after is what are the principles that go into a theory of the living, right? Um you know, how do
7:31
we how do we have a set of principles that helps us understand how life first came to be? How you get an origin of life, how that life starts to gain more
7:38
complexity? Um how eventually it starts to add more and more intelligence, how you get um new types of what are called
7:46
major transitions in evolution. um as life gets bigger and more complicated, how eventually do you get new types of
7:52
life, right? And so in that paper, we argue that from certain theoretical perspectives, human culture should be
7:58
seen as life, it's just life living on a very strange substrate. That substrate is human minds. Language is the same
8:05
sort of thing. We argue that um in silic life, artificial life should also should
8:10
be no question that that counts. Um, again, it's just life living in a very weird substrate, the substrate of
8:16
computers that are built by humans and so forth. And so, our interest was really what sort of theories, what sort
8:22
of principles help us understand all of those different cases, right? And in that paper, we're very careful to say we
8:28
don't think we know what the theory is yet. We're we're far from it, but there's a style of thinking that
8:33
hopefully can push us down that path. Um, and we point to some new emerging theories that are sort of exciting. Um
8:41
there are new theories of agency. There are new theories of um semantic information. Uh David Cracker and a
8:48
bunch of colleagues have a paper on the information theory of individuality which helps us understand what an individual is. Um you know all this work
8:56
that that I and many collaborators do on on scaling laws looks like something that we can start to build into theories
9:02
of life. And in that paper we say is that these are all ingredients and at some point in the future hopefully we'll
9:07
have some projection of all these ingredients into some new thing that
9:13
we'll call life. Maybe that's a set of equations, maybe that's a set of concepts, maybe it's, you know, more
9:19
agency, less intelligence. We don't know. Um, but we think we're in an exciting time where people are building
9:24
quantitative theories to get at some of the ingredients. And again looking at the history of science there are many
9:31
cases where all the ingredients were there and then people figure out oh this is the right combination this is the right projection to give us the theory
9:38
that really gives us traction on something. cell for example he had this paper which was minds brains and
The Role of Material in Life
9:45
programs and what he was basically saying is that the physical instantiation is very important and if
9:50
you remove the instantiation then it doesn't work anymore and you had this wonderful quote in the paper you know
9:57
where you were saying that the materials on earth might be the universal life machine do we need the material
10:05
so I think we need a material right so I I agree with instantiation I
10:10
agree with embodiment. Um partly that's partly it's because embodiment is what
10:17
connects uh software or concepts to real constraints. I mean that's a lot of what
10:22
I focus on is uh once you have a cell once you have an encapsulation for the simplest life that then has to interact
10:28
with the physical world in ways where we understand what the dominant physics are and that allows us to predict quite a lot about life. Um and so here it's
10:35
important to separate sort of the universal from the particular or the path dependent or the contingent. There
10:42
are many reasons um why the particular material may not be essential. Right? So
10:48
I think uh life is such a hard problem that one way we've gotten traction is just to focus on the things we have. DNA
10:56
and RNA and ribosomes and the folded proteins that uh produce a lot of
11:01
function in cells and the lipid membranes that encapsulate them. All of that is the biochemistry we know and I
11:08
think we've gotten very attached to that because we're still trying to understand that how it came to be um what it all
11:13
the things it does how it gets more complicated. But if we really step back for a second, there's lots of ways to
11:20
achieve the same sorts of functions, right? And one can make a a sort of functionalist argument about what life
11:26
might be. And then the materials become much less central, right? You could have
11:32
radically different materials performing the same sort of function, right? And so we we sort of talk about this in that
11:37
paper in computational terms. You can say you know there there's an abstract
11:42
algorithm and then there are often many different hardware you could implement that algorithm on and the mapping is
11:49
what one has to think about. That's where there's some trickiness. Um, you could even say there's a process for
11:55
which there are many algorithms that will have the same sort of outcome like sorting and that then could have
12:00
multiple softwares and multiple hardwares and the outcome is the same somehow a sorted list, right? You could
12:07
talk about relative efficiencies and other sort of constraints. Um, and so I think it's sort of going back and forth
12:13
between all those layers to say what what types of things do we want in life uh in understanding life for those same
12:20
sorts of principles. I'll say this is a hugely emerging topic at the moment to
12:25
sort of um focus on the functional bit of life and to use that to sort of say
12:31
the materials might be less important. So David and I wrote about it in that paper. Michael Lochman has been working on this. Michael uh Sarah Walker Lee
12:38
Cronin and I have been working on this in in other work. And so I think it's really an exciting time for sort of trying to step away from uh the
12:46
particulars of materials and trying to understand some principles about life. Yes. And as an aside, I've spoken to
A Hierarchy for Understanding Life
12:52
several functionalists this week, like for example, Yosha Bach, and he has an information ontology, and I suppose
12:59
you're pointing to a type of functionalism which is compatible with materialism, where you could have higher
13:04
order processes, and these processes could ensconce themselves in other types of material. And we're not really
13:10
rejecting materialism, but I wanted to talk about your hierarchy. So, this is absolutely fascinating. So, there are
13:15
three levels. There's materials, so things like chemical bonds and kinetics. There's constraints, so things like the
13:22
maximum entropy principle, and optimization, so things like variational and action methods. And and we're going
13:28
to show a graphic on the screen now. So you know this this amazing visual hierarchy that you've got in the paper
13:34
and you kind of show that these levels work together and there's the the space
13:40
of living at the top where we have these highle principles and that's not completely homogeneous but more
13:45
homogeneous and in the middle we have quite a diverse heterogeneous set of constraints and then we have the set of
13:51
possible materials at the bottom. Absolutely amazing. Can you explain that? Yeah. So our proposal there is that you
How Life Diversifies and Converges
13:57
could get lots of different origins of life on different planets in radically different materials and then all of them
14:03
would undergo one of these phoggenetic um trees where organisms compete and
14:08
diversify and and mutate and evolve and so forth. That could be happening on really different substrates. And our
14:15
proof of concept there is sort of uh you know language which I said already is
14:20
evolving on the substrate of human minds. People have written down really nice theories for that showing that it's
14:26
an evolutionary dynamic that you can write down the evolutionary process for language. So there you're getting an
14:31
evolutionary dynamic um on top of a new substrate human minds. Now you could say well that substrate is still made of
14:37
carbon and all the rest but that's not really the essential piece right it's the substrate that behaves in a certain way. It has new properties and on top of
14:43
that you get something like language and then culture. So we think the materials were completely uncommitted to the
14:48
materials could be totally different. they're like different hardware implementations. Um, and we expect that
14:53
to be quite diverse across the universe for that reason, right? So, we don't think um you should expect to go to a
15:01
say a different solar system and find if we do find intelligent life, find intelligent life built on exactly the
15:07
same biochemistry. We think that would be exceptionally um unexpected, right? Um so then you could say, okay, so are
15:14
we just stuck with that? Are we stuck with this huge diversity of life across the universe? There's nothing more to say about it. Not quite. Because all of
15:20
that still lives in a physical universe. It still lives within the constraints of physics. So you if you lift up a layer,
15:26
then you have the laws of gravity, the laws of diffusion, um all sorts of
15:32
different physical forces that matter to organisms, matter to any organism made of anything at a particular scale. And
15:39
so there you can then start to say, well, if I write down theories based on imagine I just have a cell in a fluid um
15:45
that has to interact with a diffusive process. Great. That's a really general model. I haven't actually had to tell
15:51
you much about the materials. You know, I didn't invoke DNA in telling you that story. I didn't invoke proteins. Um, so
15:57
now we could say there's something we can say about any sphere of living
16:02
material that's really small, say bacterial scale, anywhere in the universe, right? And so so that's our
16:08
strong proposal is that once we lift to the layer of constraints like physics, we're collapsing a huge amount of
16:15
material diversity into a more compressed space of constraints. But
16:20
there still could be ways materials put you in different constraint spaces. Different planets still could have
16:26
radically different constraints because of things like temperature and pressure and the particular chemistry and you
16:31
know um how acidic the environment is all those sorts of things. So we still allow for some diversity there. And then
16:37
the question is okay but what would any living process be doing and that's what lifts us up to these optimization
16:43
principles right so many people including David have written about how
16:48
evolution is a learning dynamic right there there's certain ways you can write down the equations it looks exactly like
16:53
certain learning dynamics they're used repeatedly that feels much more like a an abstracted principle that should be
17:00
true of any living system just that it's it's following a certain sort of evolutionary dynamic. There's there's
17:05
actually this wonderful thing um called the air threshold which is uh how fast
17:12
can you mutate given how much information you're trying to propagate to the next generation
17:17
the Miller principle yes so that is equivalent also gets called the air threshold and if I mutate
17:22
too quickly I can't adapt anymore given how much information I have again there I haven't said anything about materials
17:28
I haven't even said anything about physics I've just said you're an evolving process with some air rate and
17:33
you're trying to adapt to a new world. There are constraints on uh how fast you can mutate and still be able to adapt
17:40
given the size of the information and how big your population is and some other things that matter for evolutionary theory. But uh but that's
17:46
really fundamental, right? That should apply to language and culture and cells and genomes and all the rest.
Adaptive Processes and Defining Life
17:53
Yeah. And even that as a principle of life is fascinating. I mean that conversation I had with David was was just earthshattering for me. But he was
17:59
talking about these adaptive processes that kind of surpass um traditional
18:05
evolution. Uh so for example ontogenic hacking which is where we can store
18:11
information in our nervous systems and brains and culture and so on. And there was a quote um from David's paper. I'm
18:16
not sure if you were on that paper as well, but the definition of life was the union of two cro crucial energetic
18:22
information processes producing an autonomous system metabolically encoding and extracting information of survival
18:29
value and propagating through time. Isn't that isn't that fascinating? I I love that. Yeah. And I and I think
18:36
again um I think that definition has all of the
18:41
ingredients that we think will eventually be in a definition or a theory of life. um the community at
18:47
present has different waitings on those different uh pieces of that right so
18:52
some people are very focused on metabolism and energy I I work a lot on energy although I'm not um I don't think
18:58
it's the only thing some people are very focused on um you know autooesis
19:04
self-generation um replication to the next generation other people are very focused on information other people are very focused on computation so I think
19:10
all the ingredients are there and um there's something exciting happening in the field because many people's you know
19:18
theories have these overlapping ingredients and I think it's just about weighting them and quantifying the sort
19:23
of details of how how we bring each into a sophisticated set of metrics right
Functionalism, Memes, and Phylogenies
19:28
yeah what I love about this functionalist perspective is the substrate independence so there's this beautiful
19:35
idea of a kind of memelex where you have certain patterns of functional processing and they can jump into
19:43
different fogynies Can you give me an example of that? I mean, does that explain potentially how
19:49
the sophisticated life that we have in our fogyny could it potentially have transferred from another one? Yeah. So,
19:55
I think there's there's sort of different ways to think about that. One is there is a whole lot of lateral transfer that can happen across the tree
20:01
of life in lots of different ways, right? So, even in bacteria, you have these lateral gene transfers where um you can move bits of genome from one
20:08
genome to another. So, you can discover something in one lineage and then bring it over to another lineage. That's great. There's this whole other process
20:14
of just uh good old-fashioned convergence which is an old idea and it just says
20:20
that um in certain cases there are targets for um a function that if you
20:27
achieve that function it's likely to look a certain way and so you see similar solutions across the tree of
20:32
life. Right? So so we get many origins of the eye. Right? Right? So you can imagine like the eye is so complicated
20:38
maybe it only gets discovered once and then everything that has an eye has a
20:43
common ancestor. Not true. Um eyes evolve many times. There are differences
20:49
in the details of eyes um in terms of how exactly they see and how they're constructed and slightly what they're
20:54
made of and so forth. But in some notion they're all doing the same sort of physics. So that's the convergent bit
21:01
right and and the convergent bit is because the physics is a target right we understand that uh you know there's uh
21:09
as is happening to both of us right now certain ways to focus light and obtain a picture at a distance and and so forth
21:16
and so that's really the target for convergence so I think there are two things happening lineages sometimes it gets discovered in one lineage and
21:22
transferred and the other is just something is uh so predicted by physics that if the function happens it will
21:29
look a certain way even if some of the details are different. I think what's really interesting about human society
21:34
is that we're really really good at the transfer bit, right? Um and so for
21:40
example, you can have things discovered in entirely different cultures with different languages. Um and sometimes
21:48
those get uh things like agriculture get discovered multiple times. That's maybe more of a convergent thing. But then
21:54
there's other cases where you have some really neat thing discovered in one uh part of human society and then it can
22:00
just immediately propagate to the rest. Right? Because our genomes for intaking
22:05
and and taking on information or rejecting it are really flexible. I mean genome is very abstracted. I mean our
22:11
our sort of cultural genomes, right? Um and and because that process is if you tell me an idea, I can filter it, think
22:18
about it, decide if I want to integrate it and so forth, right? So it's you might try to, you know, mutate my mind
22:26
in some way by giving me a little bit of information, but I get to think about
22:31
that and process it and decide if I want to integrate on it, integrate it, and decide what actions I might want to take on it. Um, that's all really key. And I
22:39
think that's sort of the extra sauce of society and culture is is that um we
22:45
have a higher rate of transfer, but we also have really good procedures for deciding if we want to allow the transfer or not. Right? um if I tell you
22:52
a bad idea you might um remember it for zero seconds right and that's important
Convergence at Multiple Levels
22:58
and does the convergence happen at multiple levels so you know just with this hierarchy that that you proposed in mind um I can understand how the
23:05
principle of least action or something will um give rise to the convergence of
23:11
certain patterns in in different parts of the fogyny and then perhaps at the um at the optimization level we might have
23:16
a higher level of of um you know more abstract form of convergence in different parts of the fogyny. But I
23:21
suppose what I'm driving to here is do you think that there could be some some kind of information fogyny which can
23:28
eventually transcend the material substrate? You know, does it resemble a basin of attraction where patterns can't
23:36
really sort of migrate to very different materials or do you think there's something higher level going on which
23:41
really allows patterns to move around? Wouldn't that be cool? Yeah, I think I think many people have a notion that
23:48
that might be something like that if we can find the right projection, a general enough theory. Um, I don't think it's
23:54
something we currently have a ton of traction on. But maybe maybe it is. I mean, people are thinking very hard
24:00
about okay, so software evolution, how does that look like? Biological evolution, you know, all these different
24:05
things. Um and maybe someday we will find a notion where we realize oh right uh life just you know has this process
24:12
and then when we started to build software systems it did exactly the same thing in terms of a bunch of people
24:18
working on some open- source piece of code that uh then had a very particular evolutionary dynamic. I don't think we
24:24
know what those projections look like other than at these very coar grain what's the macro scale evolutionary
24:30
dynamic. Um and uh so yeah it's there's still some fuzziness there but I but I
24:36
think the hope is that someday one can find that projection. Um I I mean I think in general this is a very meta
24:41
point but I think in general theories are often you know good theories should either tell you a bunch of things that
24:46
look different or actually just a projection onto one space when you see it at exactly the right angle. Right?
24:53
All the things line up you realize oh that was just one thing. or theory should tell you no at the most
24:58
fundamental level these things are ex are you know provably different. There's
25:04
no way to project them into the same space. They're fundamentally different in some interesting way or these are the
25:09
similarities they share and these are the similarities they we know provably can't um be shared by the two things. So
25:15
that that to me is sort of the whole goal of theories to tell us what's the same but hiding in plain sight where the
25:21
sameness is hiding in plain sight and what's fundamentally different and similar to how we started the
25:26
conversation in this paper you said there are extant theories of of life so comparing existing life historical
25:32
theories so looking at the trajectories and principles so abstract principles for all possible life and we we are a
25:40
little bit earth ccentric in in how we think about life and the million question for me is could we simulate
The Possibility of Simulating Life
25:47
life in a computer? Oh, it's a very interesting question. So, I think I think if you can get enough constraints and you can get sort
25:54
of enough complexity in the environment, then there's no reason you couldn't
26:00
simulate life in a computer. Computer viruses, we say, are lifelike, right? They, you know, they get passed around
26:07
and they have functions and they're hard to get rid of and all these other sorts of things. and um some of them might
26:12
even evolve and and so forth, right? And so that's an interesting case. Um there
26:18
are perpetual debates about uh whether anything counts as life in any context,
26:24
right? Whether that's creating synthetic life in the lab or um creating artificial life in the computer. There's
26:30
endless debates about where the threshold would be. Um I think part of that is that we don't have a strong theory, right? So, you know, if if you
26:39
and I wrote down a two-dimensional simulation for a gas in a computer and
26:45
we asked, okay, is this obeying the second law of thermodynamics? You and I would immediately be able to
26:50
say yes or no. There's there's just a calculation we could do and we could say and not obviously your computer's
26:57
obeying the second law of thermodynamics. It's heating up the room and the air conditioner's fighting against that and all the rest. But even
27:03
in the environment of the computer, someone could look at my code and run my simulation and say, you know, that's a
27:08
really interesting simulation you created. But I don't think it obey I don't think you've built in it obeying the second law of thermodynamics. Right?
27:14
Now, if we wanted to try and do the same thing for a living system, that becomes a much harder conversation. Right? I
27:20
mean, if we wanted to say like, okay, I really have a simulation on my computer that is life. uh then it's then we're
27:27
into this whole axiom space where the thresholds are and we and we just don't have a good compact theory to tell us
27:32
when we've crossed that threshold. But I think in principle there's just there's no reason why with enough compute with
27:38
enough constraints with enough complexity inside um some artificial world um you could create um you know
27:45
you could create life. Now, there's a whole other question here about embodiment. Um, and there are people who
27:52
have, you know, strong commitments to, uh, a certain sort of materialism. Um,
27:58
that would rule out certain computer simulations. Uh, that's part of a really interesting philosophical debate, right?
28:04
Um, and and for me, I'm I'm mostly interested in um in principles, and so I
28:10
I don't have strong commitments to those debates yet because I don't think we understand all the the principles. Yeah,
Intelligence, Parasitism, and Spectrums of Life
28:16
I mean we intuitively know that the the causal graph will be different. The the the energy um usage will be different.
28:23
There are differences, but um David said something interesting which is you know he thinks about life in terms of
28:28
representation, inference and adaptivity. And it just brings up all of these interesting questions like is a
28:35
virus intelligent? Is culture intelligent? And with the virus one in particular, we kind of feel that it
28:41
doesn't make sense to talk about it as being a life form when it's so obviously
28:46
parasitic on its instantiation. And we are increasingly kind of going to this abstract level now where we're
28:52
talking about things that supervene on the physical many levels down as being possibly agents or intelligent organisms
28:59
in their own right. And and just the language that we use, you know, it's the same thing in language models. We use
29:05
mentalistic terms like um beliefs and deception and thinking and it's hard for
29:11
us to think about this because the language that we use is so grounded in the way we do it.
29:17
Yeah. Yeah. So I think I think that's a very interesting point and you know we would say so a lot of the thinking about
29:24
what is life has been trying to argue about lists of axioms right life needs to have this and that and that and then
29:30
what you put in the list rules in and rules out what is life and so some lists account for viruses and other lists
29:36
don't. Um we really tried to argue in that paper that the dynamic of viruses
29:42
is is clearly living. And then we try to point out that there's a really weird thing about parasitism, right? Is how we
29:49
view it. So if you think about a virus like language or culture, it's an
29:55
organism that has a very strange environment. That environment is a host like us or like bacteria. You know,
30:01
viruses infect bacteria as well. Um and so it's a it's a a very strange life
30:07
form with a really complicated environment. And it but we're a strange life form with a really complicated
30:12
environment, right? We don't make our own energy directly. You know, it's, you know, you and I didn't sit outside in
30:18
the sun for an hour and a half before this interview photosynthesizing and building up enough sugars to, you know,
30:23
have the mental energy to talk about this. Um, we ate a bunch of vegetables and other things that did do all that
30:29
work, right? And so we're already in some sense all heterotroofes, all
30:36
predators in some sense are a certain sort of parasite, right? we require other things that are doing the primary work of energy capture and
30:42
transformation. Um we also have this internal microbiome, right? So we're a walking ecology. So we're both parasites
30:49
and in ecology. And so our argument in that paper is um if you take a
30:54
cyanobacterium, which is just a small organism that makes energy directly from the sun. Um it's simple, it's
31:01
self-contained, it gets all of its energy right from the sun. Maybe that thing is the most living thing. But as
31:07
you move away from that towards viruses and us, you know, there's certain perspectives where we'd say we're not
31:13
necessarily more living than a virus. There are other perspectives where we're clearly more living, right? You and I are having this conversation. We've put
31:19
things on the moon. You know, there's a certain sort of agency prediction about the future technology construction um
31:27
that is clearly unique about many of the things that we do. But in the wrong in
31:32
the wrong projection, again thinking about this projection space, the wrong projection, us and viruses look like the
31:37
same sort of parasites living on different types of really complicated environments. Um, and so I think uh we
31:45
can start to think about how that applies to AI and learning in general. Um, and sort of to this other point you
31:51
made about intelligence, I think a lot of us want to put all of the things that matter to life on a spectrum, right?
31:57
which is is what physics does a good job of as well which is to say I want to say that something has zero intelligence
32:04
I don't want to or I want to say it has 10 the minus 20 intelligence in some units right I don't want to have this
32:10
binary is it intelligent or not I want to be able to say to arrange sort of all systems that might be intelligent on a
32:16
spectrum and maybe that spectrum goes 10 the minus some huge number up to uh some
32:23
really big number 10 of the positive huge number and we're on one end of the spectrum of that. But I think that's what we need for all of these things. Um
32:30
for agency, for intelligence, for um self-replication, all of those need to be put on a spectrum so that we can
32:36
fairly compare them. Um yeah. Yeah. And and I think it's possible to have categories and spectrums at the
Phase Changes in Evolution
32:42
same time. So you can have spectrums inside the categories because I'm very interested when when we look at the the fogyny, we see these phase changes and
32:50
and maybe um emergence is a term we might use. So for example going from abiotic to biotic or also um I speak to
32:58
a lot of goi people and and they adopt a form of cognitive chauvinism where they say humans have cognitive properties
33:04
that other things don't. So you know we we can have a belief in in in a strong sense our form of intelligence and
33:11
agency is some something to do with the types of computation we can do. So we
33:16
you know at some point we become touring machines. We have this Prometheus moment with language or or something like that.
33:22
So I suppose the question is what triggers these prometheian moments where we see huge changes.
33:29
Yeah. So I think I think that is important right that even if you have a metric like I was just describing that
33:35
metric can have sudden jumps and it's important then to talk about what those jumps are. I mean there's a reason we
33:40
call uh water water and ice ice right um
33:45
you can write down an order parameter and you get a jump and that's cool right? Uh that's really nice. So I think
33:52
uh we've been doing a lot of work to try to understand why you have those jumps over the history of life. And what we
33:58
typically see is that you have some set of physical constraints that matter for
34:04
a class of organisms that predicts how things will change as the organism gets bigger or smaller
34:11
and and we have nice theory predicting that. Those theories also tell you that at the boundary of those scaling
34:18
relationships, you often get these strong asmatic behaviors where things go off to infinity or zero. There's some
34:24
hard limit to a category of organis organization of organisms. Um, and so
34:29
that creates a wall, an evolutionary wall, and that is where a phase transition is going to happen, right? You need to do something to jump over
34:35
the wall. Now, I'm not sure you always jump over the wall. It's not clear to me you always get these evolutionary
34:41
transitions and I'll explain why in a second. But if you're going to get bigger than a certain scale, it says you
34:47
need to invent a certain sort of architecture that gets you away from that. And that architecture is characteristically different. So going from bacteria to unicellar ukarotes, you
34:54
have to put one proarote inside another proarot. Looks like it was a bacteria inside an archa. That's a new sort of
35:01
architecture, right? Now suddenly you have two genomes. Um you have more internal membranes. There's something
35:07
really different happening there. When you go to multisellularity, true multisellularity, where you're
35:12
differentiating cell types and and creating organs and tissues and all the rest, not just living in a colony,
35:18
that's another sort of organization that requires a different kind of regulation, communication, uh developmental programs
35:25
that get you there. That's another phase transition. Interestingly, when we look at when those jumps happen, they
35:31
typically happen around huge shifts in uh Earth history. So when the environment of the planet radically
35:37
changes. So we have a paper showing that um snowball earth which is this period in earth history happened a few times
35:44
where the planet almost completely covers itself in ice. That we think that induces multisellularity that a bunch of
35:51
physical conditions become just right then to get bigger and become complex multisellulars. you discover that and
35:56
then when the world thaws out again that is around and spreads and uh becomes
36:02
bigger and and you've you've found that solution. So that's a case where yes there are these transitions we
36:09
understand what the wall on one side is and then maybe sometimes you need an environmental inducement to jump the
The Separation of Matter and Logic
36:16
wall. You invoked David Deutsch um in in your paper. So he had this book um the the
36:21
beginning of infinity and he spoke about the importance of separating matter and logic. What did he mean by that?
36:27
I could look at a computer and just say it's a bunch of electrons moving around,
36:32
right? It's it's uh you know some complicated network with a current running over it. A river is a
36:39
complicated network with a current running over it. Right? What's what's unique about a computer is that we've
36:44
built it in a certain way to perform certain logical operations um in a
36:49
repeatable way so that we can give it inputs and give it outputs and in the case of generalized computers we can
36:55
reprogram it and and have sort of an arbitrary notion of what inputs and outputs we want right we can write
37:00
software to it um so I think that's that's really the key is to say in the
37:05
in the crudest sense the physical description leaves out a whole bunch of information Right. And to understand
37:12
certain architectures or why the architecture is there, you would need to bring in a logical or a software notion.
37:17
Uh and I think that's what that separation is about. Yeah. Can we talk about assembly theory? So
Assembly Theory and Quantifying Complexity
37:24
you you've got a paper out about this and it it's a a way of kind of quantifying um complexity I suppose by
37:31
looking at how something can be built step by step. Can can you explain what that is?
37:37
Yeah. So this is um a theory initially aimed at trying to search for life in the universe. Um so a chemist Lee Cronin
37:45
um and a a theoretical physicist Sarah Walker um and and then a bunch of other
37:51
of us who have gotten involved um were have been interested in this idea of how do you fairly and without being
37:59
committed to this past knowledge I was talking about before the biochemistry we have how do you fairly look for life in
38:05
the universe? Um, and so assembly theory simply says, uh, one way to do that is
38:11
to look at the recursive use of parts and what the shortest path to build an object is, right? And and so here's the
38:19
thing you're trying to get away from. I hand you a molecule and I say, is this molecule complex? And I don't I'm not
38:24
allowed to tell you anything about the synthesis that we use to make it. I'm not allowed to tell you if a living
38:30
system made it. I'm not allowed to tell you if that living system shares our biochemistry, has different biochemistry. How do you decide if that
38:36
molecule is is complex or not? Um, and the the what we want is something that
38:42
bounds that complexity, right? I want sort of an ultimate bound in that complexity. And one way to do that is
38:48
just to say when you have a synthesis pathway, say you have an evolving um set
38:53
of objects that are following some evolutionary lineage, you invent a set of parts and then the easiest thing to
39:00
do is take those parts and reuse them in some way, right? Um and then if you
39:06
invent a new part, that's sort of a more complicated thing to do. With that sort of notion in mind, you could say, I give
39:11
you an object and you're just trying to find the shortest path to build it where you build up a set of parts and then can
39:18
recursively use those to make a next set of parts and you ask how often you have to build a new part or use an old part.
39:23
Each of those counts as a step and you're just trying to find this the shortest path um to get something. And
39:30
uh that's definitely a bound, right? certain processes could take m could be
39:35
much more complicated in building that up. But it sort of lower bounds the complexity. And then by comparing all
39:41
these lower bounds of complexity, you can sort of fairly compare how um complex an object is in the best case
39:49
sort of shortest path um uh process. And so this gets away from things like if I
39:54
hand you carbon 60, which is has a large molecular weight. Um you could say well
40:00
that's a very big object but it's actually not so complex in those terms right in this assembly theoretic
40:06
perspective and so um experimentally it looks like there's and this is work that
40:11
Lee's done in his lab it looks like there's a threshold um where you can go from abiotic to the biotic um each step
40:19
in assembly space is in a very rapidly growing space of combinatorial
40:25
possibilities so each step is a really big step and So to have you expect sort
40:30
of a sharp cut off there somewhere and it looks like that happens um uh in the experimental data which is exciting.
40:36
Chris this has been absolutely amazing. Thank you so much for joining us. Oh it's been a blast. Thank you so much. Yeah.
