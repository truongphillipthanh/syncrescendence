Cathie Wood believes the market is missing the most important economic story of 2025. While headlines focus on tariffs and dollar worries, she sees the biggest corporate tax cut in modern history driving a major productivity boom in the United States. This video explains why lower effective tax rates, deregulation, and innovation investment could accelerate growth in AI, robotics, and manufacturing.

• How US effective corporate tax rates dropped to 10–12%
• Why this could trigger a massive investment surge into AI and R&D
• The link between productivity gains and sustainable economic expansion
• Why the dollar could strengthen, not weaken
• How Cathie Wood sees technology adoption speeding up

The new depreciation rules make the United States the lowest-tax major economy, unlocking capital for disruptive innovation across sectors such as artificial intelligence, robotics, energy, and biotech. Cathie Wood argues this shift mirrors and potentially exceeds the economic expansion seen during Reaganomics as foreign investment flows in and productivity boosts reduce inflation risk. This policy change supports stronger returns on US capital, fuels exponential technology curves, and reinforces bullish long-term forecasts for digital assets like Bitcoin and for US leadership in next-generation technology.

Kathy Wood just went on a monologue and
0:02
she made some pretty excellent and
0:03
optimistic views on how she sees this
0:06
current market. When Kathy speaks, I
0:08
listen. Check this out. You
0:09
know, we've been thinking and and giving
0:13
you evidence over the last 3 years that
0:15
the US economy has been in a rolling
0:18
recession. Manufacturing negative for
0:20
three years. Small businesses suffering,
0:24
low and middle inome consumers
0:26
suffering, even capital spending. I know
0:30
the headlines are all about AI and power
0:32
needs, but X X those, we've seen a
0:37
flattening out, if not a decline, in
0:39
many capital spending sectors. So, we
0:44
now are looking at the early days of
0:48
this Trump administration. seems like a
0:51
lot of drama uh and headlines primarily
0:54
about tariffs, but underneath in terms
0:58
of real policy moves, OB3, so the one
1:02
big beautiful bill, which passed on July
1:05
4th, included some massive changes in
1:10
tax policy. I think the most important
1:13
ones involve depreciation
1:15
and they are taking the effective
1:19
corporate tax rate that the the
1:20
statutory tax rate is still 21% but
1:25
incorporating depreciation schedules the
1:28
new ones for manufacturing facilities,
1:31
equipment, domestic R&D and software.
1:35
the effective corporate tax rate has
1:38
probably dropped into the 10 to 12%
1:42
range, which makes it really the lowest
1:45
in the world for any major economy. So,
1:47
we do believe that we're moving from a
1:51
rolling recession into a rolling
1:53
recovery. It's going to take a little
1:55
time to catch fire and we think that
1:59
employment is a lagging indicator. So,
2:01
we're going to hear more bad news about
2:03
employment for both cyclical reasons and
2:06
because AI is limiting the job
2:09
opportunities for especially new college
2:13
graduates. But we do think that the tax
2:17
policy changes and critically
2:20
deregulation everywhere. The edict from
2:24
on high was deregulate, deregulate,
2:26
deregulated. And we are seeing it all
2:29
over the place, especially in healthcare
2:32
and crypto and even AI. The first
2:36
executive order that President Trump
2:39
rescended was Biden's AI executive order
2:43
because we really do believe right now
2:46
we're still in very early stages, the
2:50
equivalent of 1995
2:53
in terms of the internet. We're in early
2:55
stages as it relates to AI and there
2:58
were some ownorous regulations moving
3:02
into the policym arena. We believe we're
3:04
moving into a productivitydriven
3:07
boom in activity. I think the plan was
3:10
this to the extent President Trump and
3:12
team could control it. Get all the bad
3:14
news out early in this term and as we
3:19
move into the election campaign season
3:23
for the midterms have the economy move
3:27
into a very strong expansion. So that's
3:31
what we expect and because it's
3:33
productivity driven we believe that the
3:36
surprises
3:37
will be on the low side of inflation
3:40
expectations.
3:42
So this is very much like the economy
3:44
that regonomics unleashed in the 80s and
3:47
90s and we think that this could be a
3:50
much more powerful version of that. So,
3:53
we're very excited about the outlook for
3:56
the economy, innovation, and the markets
3:59
generally.
4:00
I'm going to come back with one more
4:02
just on the macro side here, too. We're
4:04
hearing a lot of talk about just US
4:06
dollar weakening and gold and Bitcoin
4:08
and how that relates, gold hitting new
4:10
highs. Can you just give us your kind of
4:12
quick take on that?
4:13
Yes, it's very interesting. I just took
4:16
a trip around the world actually and I
4:19
saw the negative sentiment about the US
4:22
mostly because of the headlines tariffs
4:25
they've really colored the point of view
4:27
of investors in the rest of the world
4:29
and you know I heard dollar weakness a
4:33
familiar refrain abroad first half of
4:36
the year weakest dollar since by some
4:39
metrics 1973
4:42
and I gave them the outlook book that I
4:45
just described here and actually took
4:49
the opposite point of view. I think the
4:51
dollar and this happened during
4:53
regonomics as well. I think the dollar
4:55
is going to go up and that's because I
4:59
believe given the policies that have
5:02
been put in place that the returns on
5:04
invested capital in the US are going to
5:07
go up relative to the rest of the world
5:10
and that foreign direct investment will
5:13
increase substantially
5:15
we think is is going to be a surprise.
5:19
One of the reasons gold has been going
5:21
up is this narrative. The dollar is
5:24
debasing and so that's a boon for for
5:28
gold and for bitcoin. Well, if the
5:32
dollar becomes as good as gold and this
5:36
is uh an expression that art laugher,
5:39
you've heard me talk about la art and
5:41
the laugher curve. He's also a monetary
5:44
expert and as we've been discussing this
5:48
scenario with him, he brought this
5:51
framing back which is well if the dollar
5:53
becomes as good as gold then why hold
5:57
gold? So we shall see. Gold did go down.
6:01
It peaked in the early8s, actually 1980
6:05
at $800 and went down over the next two
6:09
years to $300
6:11
with that kind of dollar strength. The
6:15
dollar strength did not end until 1985.
6:19
The dollar actually doubled from its low
6:22
to its peak in 1985, at which point the
6:26
rest of the world was suffering. There
6:29
was a huge amount of dollar denominated
6:31
debt in countries whose currencies were
6:35
depreciating rapidly. So debt service
6:38
became ownorous if not impossible. And
6:40
we ended up with a worldwide
6:44
easing effectively with the dollar
6:47
providing more dollars. I mean the US
6:50
providing more dollars into the global
6:52
ecosystem. I think we're going to be
6:54
back to the future on that as well. As
6:56
far as Bitcoin, well, Bitcoin is digital
7:00
gold, but as we've said many times, it
7:03
is also a technology and it's the first
7:07
of its kind in a new asset class. That
7:10
paper, I believe, is still on our
7:12
website. Maybe we can put it into this
7:15
webinar. First of its kind in a new
7:17
asset class, and institutions have just
7:20
started tiptoeing into it. Everyone's
7:23
freaking out about tariffs and dollar
7:25
weakness, but Kathy Wood is looking at
7:27
something completely different. The
7:29
biggest corporate tax cut in modern
7:30
history that nobody's talking about. The
7:33
effective corporate tax rate just
7:35
dropped to 10 to 12% through new
7:37
depreciation rules, making the US the
7:40
lowest tax major economy and setting up
7:43
a productivity driven boom that most
7:45
people are completely missing. Kathy
7:47
explains that while the statutory
7:49
corporation tax remains 21%, new
7:52
depreciation schedules for manufacturing
7:54
facilities, equipment, domestic R&D, and
7:57
software have dropped the effective rate
8:00
to probably around the 10 to 12% range,
8:03
making it the lowest in the world for
8:04
any major economy. Kathy says this is
8:07
combined with deregulation everywhere.
8:09
The directive was deregulate,
8:11
deregulate, deregulate, especially in
8:14
healthcare, crypto, and AI. Do you
8:16
believe we're moving from a rolling
8:18
recession into a rolling recovery? This
8:20
is maybe the most underappreciated
8:22
policy change of 2025. Everyone's
8:25
obsessing over tariff headlines while a
8:27
fundamental restructuring of corporate
8:29
taxation just happened with almost no
8:32
media coverage. The statutory rate
8:34
staying at 21% is what gets reported.
8:37
But the effective rate is what actually
8:39
matters for corporate decisions.
8:40
Depreciation schedules determine how
8:42
fast companies can write off
8:44
investments. If you can immediately
8:45
expense manufacturing facilities,
8:47
equipment, R&D, and software in year 1
8:51
instead of depreciating them over 10
8:53
over 5 to 15 years, your effective tax
8:56
rate plummets. You're getting massive
8:57
tax shields that reduce actual taxes
9:00
paid to a fraction of the statutory
9:02
rate. At 10 to 12% effective rate, the
9:05
US becomes the most attractive developed
9:07
market for corporate investment by a
9:09
huge margin. Germany's effective rate is
9:12
around 30, France 25, UK 19, Japan 30%,
9:17
and China 25. The US just became the
9:20
global tax haven for productive business
9:22
investment. This creates a compounding
9:24
effect. Lower taxation means higher
9:26
returns on invested capital. High
9:28
returns attract more capital investment.
9:30
More investment means more productivity
9:32
growth. More productivity growth means
9:34
companies can grow revenue without
9:36
proportional headcount increases. That's
9:39
how you get sustained economic expansion
9:41
without triggering inflation.
9:43
Productivity gains offset wage
9:45
increases. Kathy makes an interesting
9:47
comparison to regonomics. The 1980s tax
9:49
cuts and deregulation unleashed a two
9:52
decade boom, but Reagan's corporate tax
9:54
cuts were modest compared to this,
9:57
dropping from 46% to 34%. Going from an
10:00
effective 21 to 10 to 12% is a much
10:03
larger relative change. But the economic
10:05
implications go way beyond just growth.
10:07
They completely flipped the conventional
10:09
wisdom about the dollar. The dollar is
10:11
likely to strengthen significantly, not
10:13
weaken, because higher returns on US
10:16
capital will drive massive foreign
10:18
direct investment. Exactly like what
10:20
happened during Reegonomics when the
10:22
dollar doubled. Everyone's worried about
10:24
dollar debasement from deficits and
10:26
tariffs disrupting trade. But Kathy's
10:28
looking at capital flows, not trade
10:30
flows. And capital flows are what
10:32
actually determine currency strength
10:34
over time. The mechanism is
10:35
straightforward. If US effective
10:37
corporate tax rates are 10 to 12% whilst
10:40
Europe is 25 to 30%, where would you
10:43
invest $100 million building a new
10:45
factory? The after tax returns in the US
10:47
are dramatically higher. That preference
10:50
drives foreign direct investment which
10:52
requires buying dollars to make those
10:54
investments. Higher demand for dollars
10:56
makes the dollar stronger. The Bitcoin
10:58
angle is interesting because Cathy
11:00
acknowledges it both as digital gold. It
11:02
competes with physical gold. If the
11:04
dollar strengthens significantly, both
11:06
could face headwinds. But as a
11:08
technology and new asset class, Bitcoin
11:11
has different drivers. Institutional
11:12
adoption, technological improvement, and
11:15
network effects. Those factors might
11:17
offset currency strength impacts. But
11:19
there's also something else at play
11:21
here. Lower effective corporation tax
11:23
rates accelerate investment into
11:26
innovation, meaning Cathy's bullish
11:28
timelines for technology like AI,
11:30
robots, and autonomy might actually
11:32
happen faster than she originally
11:34
predicted. Kathy has been consistently
11:36
bullish on disruptive innovation for
11:38
years, but she's always been constrained
11:40
by how fast companies could actually
11:41
deploy capital into those technologies.
11:44
High corporate taxes mean companies had
11:46
less cash to reinvest. Slow regulatory
11:50
approval meant projects took years
11:51
longer than necessary. Both factors
11:54
extended her timelines. Now both
11:56
constraints just lifted simultaneously.
11:58
Companies can immediately expense all
12:00
their R&D and equipment spending, which
12:02
means every dollar invested generates
12:04
massive tax shields. A company spending
12:07
$1 billion on AI infrastructure
12:09
previously paid taxes on profits before
12:12
investing. Now they can expense that $1
12:14
billion immediately reducing their tax
12:17
bill by1 to $200 million depending on
12:20
the structure. That's$1 to $200 million
12:23
more capital to invest into the next
12:25
round of innovation. This creates a
12:27
feedback loop for Cathy's investment
12:29
thesis. She's been betting on
12:30
exponential technology curves in
12:32
genomics, AI, robotics, energy storage,
12:35
and blockchain. She's been betting on
12:37
those curves always going to happen
12:39
eventually, but the speed at which they
12:41
happen depends on capital availability
12:43
and regulatory friction. Both just
12:46
improve dramatically. We don't have
12:48
crazy perks yet, but if you believe in
12:50
what we're doing and want to help us
12:52
keep going, joining as a member really
12:54
helps make a difference. Every bit of
