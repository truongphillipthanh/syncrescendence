## Description (no transcript available)

A 100-trillion-token study from OpenRouter and A16Z analyzes real-world LLM interactions and documents a paradigm shift toward reasoning models and more tool invocation. Programming surged to dominate token consumption, rising from about 11% to over 50%, while roleplay and creative dialogue lead open-source usage. Open-source models, especially Chinese releases, gained major market share and now coexist with closed models as high-volume versus high-value options, driving adoption of routers and wrappers for model routing and persistence.
