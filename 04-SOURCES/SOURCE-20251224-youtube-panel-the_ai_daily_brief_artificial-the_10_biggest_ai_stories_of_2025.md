## Description (no transcript available)

This episode covers the 10 biggest AI stories of 2025—how DeepSeek’s R1 shook markets, pushed reasoning into the mainstream, and intensified the US–China model race. It also breaks down the massive AI infrastructure boom (Stargate, hyperscaler capex, energy + data centers), the nonstop AI bubble debate, and what enterprise adoption really looked like behind the headlines. Finally, it explores the rise of vibe coding, the standardization of agent infrastructure (MCP, agent-to-agent protocols, context engineering), and the “next leap” models—Gemini 3, Opus 4.5, and GPT-5.2—setting the tone for 2026.
