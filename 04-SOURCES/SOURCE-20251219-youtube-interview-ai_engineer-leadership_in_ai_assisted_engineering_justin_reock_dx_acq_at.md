## Description (no transcript available)

To realize meaningful returns on AI investments, leadership must take accountability and ownership of establishing best practices, enabling engineers, measuring impact, and ensuring proper guardrails are in place. When prompting practice and reflexive AI use is driven from the top down, engineers can align on the highest value use cases and experience peak productivity gains. When coupled with DX's AI Measurement Framework, leaders can gain a clear picture of AI's true impact, identify the real bottlenecks in the SDLC that can be augmented with AI, and drive improvement. In this session, Justin Reock, Deputy CTO at DX, and author of DX's Guide to AI Assisted Engineering, will explain what the most effective leaders of AI enabled engineering organizations are doing to drive satisfactory utilization, augmentation, and psychological safety across their teams. Based on interviews, use cases, and data, leaders will walk away with an understanding of how to best lead their teams through mature AI rollouts.
