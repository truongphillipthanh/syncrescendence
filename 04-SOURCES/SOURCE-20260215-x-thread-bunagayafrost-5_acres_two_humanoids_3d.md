# Techno Homestead
5 acres. Two humanoids. 3D printer. Starlink. Solar roof. A few GPUs running a local AGI.
Security drones, chickens roam, fruit trees heavy with harvest. Kids run barefoot past potato rows, as robots fix the fence.
Civilization optional. Family of 4 on the techno homestead.
(Description: An AI-generated illustration depicting a warm, golden-hour pastoral scene of a modern family homestead. In the foreground, two young children sit barefoot in a raised garden bed, tending to vegetables. A woman and man sit together on a wooden porch deck of a sustainable dwelling with large windows and a visible solar panel array on the roof. In the mid-ground, a robot on wheels operates in the field, and a security drone is visible in the sky. The property is surrounded by mature fruit trees, established gardens, and pastures. The architecture blends natural wood tones with modern sustainable features. The overall aesthetic balances high-tech innovation with pastoral serenity.)
