## Description (no transcript available)

Highlights from the CES 2026 #nvidia keynote by CEO Jensen Huang. Topics include @NVIDIA's new Vera Rubin GPU architecture to power everything from generative AI models and applications ( like #chatgpt by #openai ) to humanoid robots and self-driving cars, as well as the networking technology that made NVIDIA the largest networking company on Earth. This is why NVIDIA ( #nvda stock ) is still one of the best stocks to buy in 2026. I'll post my reaction video as soon as I get home from CES!
