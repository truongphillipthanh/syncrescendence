## Description (no transcript available)

On the February episode of ITK, ARK CEO/CIO Cathie Wood explains why recent market volatility may be driven more by algorithmic selling than fundamentals and why she believes AI represents the biggest opportunity of our lifetime. She discusses the shift from one-size-fits-all software-as-a-service (SaaS) to agentic AI platforms, how accelerating productivity could challenge conventional inflation assumptions, and why Bitcoin’s long-term supply dynamics remain intact.
