## Key Concepts

### The Jagged Frontier
- AI capability is fundamentally uneven—brilliant in some domains, terrible in adjacent ones
- You cannot predict competence from surface similarity of tasks
- This creates critical organizational design problem: can't plug AI into existing structures
- Must map actual capability ruthlessly, then restructure work around it

### Engelbart vs Minsky Tension
- Engelbart: augment human intelligence (technology as amplifier)
- Minsky: replace human intelligence (technology as substitute)
- This tension was theoretical; now it's urgent business strategy
- Most organizations haven't chosen consciously—they're drifting toward replacement

### Three Ingredients for AI Adoption
1. **Domain expertise**: Someone who knows what good actually looks like
2. **Prompt craft skill**: Learnable, teachable, becoming foundational
3. **Workflow integration**: AI must be woven into how work gets done

### Abundance vs Efficiency Mindset
**Critical Choice**: Most companies optimize past (do same work cheaper) when they should invent future (do new work)
- "Review top 50 customers" vs "Review top 200 customers"—different strategic options entirely
- Efficiency is the easy, wrong path; abundance is harder, more valuable

### Knowledge Collapse Risk
- AI shortcuts bypass apprenticeship and tacit knowledge development
- Organizations lose deep expertise when everyone prompts instead of learns
- If AI breaks in novel situation, no fallback of human expertise
- Intentionally reserve some work for human development, even when AI could do it

## Paradigm-Level Insights

1. **Jagged frontier demands organizational redesign** - Traditional org charts assume predictable human capability profiles; AI breaks this assumption

2. **Prompting is foundational skill** - Not clever tricks but structured communication of intent; teachable and essential

3. **Abundance requires courage** - The gravitational pull is toward efficiency; transformation requires resisting it

4. **Apprenticeship is infrastructure** - Knowledge development isn't inefficiency—it's organizational resilience investment

5. **KPIs are counterproductive in R&D phase** - Measuring too early optimizes wrong things

## Integration Notes

- Jagged frontier concept essential for EFFICACY implementation guidance
- Three ingredients framework directly applicable to BIZ_BACKBONE adoption patterns
- Knowledge collapse warning critical for KNOWLEDGE chain preservation strategies
- Abundance mindset connects to broader SYNCRESCENDENCE growth philosophy
