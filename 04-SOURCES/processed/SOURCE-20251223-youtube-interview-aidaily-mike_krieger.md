# Mike Krieger (Anthropic CPO): 2026 Enterprise AI Vision

## Core Thesis
2026 will be defined by AI "reliably taking work off your plate"—moving from surface-level chatbots to comprehensive business process redesign. Enterprises face an "infrastructure year" requiring connector work, MCP adoption, and distributability to meet organizations where they are.

## Key Insights

### Three Worlds of AI Adoption
1. **Software engineers**: Clear productivity gains, measurable (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf)
2. **Non-engineers building software**: Underrated—Bolt, Lovable, Replit Agent democratizing creation
3. **Enterprises**: Moving slowly, carefully; similar to cloud migration dynamics of mid-2010s

### Claude Code Origins
- Started as internal "Claude CLI" in Labs team
- September→December: Rapidly overtook all internal coding tools
- Core bet: Let the model "cook longer," operate over fuzzier task definitions
- Released publicly because "if not us, someone using our models would discover this"

### Enterprise Infrastructure Gap
**MIT Study Resonance**: Surface-level chatbots ≠ business process redesign

**2026 Focus Areas:**
- Data annotation and lineage work (making data "AI-friendly")
- MCP adoption for internal services/data stores
- Moving from retrieval to action-taking
- Human-in-the-loop decision queuing

**Example**: Large bank rethinking data annotation layer so Claude could construct dashboards effectively

### "Distributability" Strategy
- Anthropic coined term for componentizing intelligence for enterprise deployment
- Meeting enterprises where they are (AWS, specific setups, regulatory constraints)
- Skills, Agent SDK, storage, memory—all need enterprise embedding
- Available on all three major clouds
- Pilots are rough-and-ready; production scale requires deep integration

### Tool vs. Colleague Framing
**2026 Emergence:**
- GitHub Agent HQ integration: Tag Claude in PR, return to completed work
- Delegating like you would to a colleague: context + expectations + good examples
- Not yet: Full onboarding, understanding org dynamics, picking up work autonomously
- Near-term: Clean task chunks with clear success criteria

### 2026 Tagline
"Reliably take work off your plate"

## Canonical Relevance
- Primary input for CANON-30300 Tech Stack Claude positioning
- Informs CANON-30400 Agentic Architecture enterprise patterns
- Validates Intelligence chain agentic trajectory
