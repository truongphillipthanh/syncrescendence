## Key Concepts

### Physics Absorbing AI
- AI research increasingly requires physics understanding
- Information theory, thermodynamics, statistical mechanics are foundational
- The distinction between "artificial" and "natural" intelligence dissolves at physical level
- Substrate independence means intelligence is about patterns, not materials

### Consciousness Testing Framework
- Proposes empirical approaches to consciousness detection
- Integrated Information Theory (IIT) provides measurable quantities
- The question isn't philosophical but scientific: what physical conditions correlate with experience?
- AI systems may or may not be conscious regardless of behavioral sophistication

### The Fermi Nuclear Analogy
**Critical Warning**: Scientists at Manhattan Project had genuine uncertainty about atmosphere ignition
- They proceeded anyway with calculated risk
- Current AI development has similar uncertainty about catastrophic outcomes
- The difference: nuclear scientists had physics to bound the risk; AI has no such bounds

### Safety as Physics Problem
- Alignment isn't just engineering—it's understanding goal-directed systems at physical level
- Control problem is fundamentally about information and energy flows
- Current approaches are heuristic; physics-grounded approaches needed

## Paradigm-Level Insights

1. **Intelligence is physics** - Not metaphor but literal: information processing is physical process with physical constraints and physical solutions

2. **Consciousness is empirically tractable** - We don't need to solve hard problem to make progress on detection and correlation

3. **Fermi precedent is exact** - Scientists knowingly accepted existential risk with incomplete models; we're doing same with AI

4. **Substrate independence cuts both ways** - If intelligence is substrate-independent, so might be suffering

5. **Physics provides grounding** - Where philosophy leads to impasse, physics offers empirical traction

## Integration Notes

- Physics-first framing directly supports INTELLIGENCE chain substrate discussions
- Consciousness testing relevant to TRANSCENDENCE boundaries
- Fermi analogy essential for SAFETY_ALIGNMENT historical framing
- Connects to Extropic/McCourt work on thermodynamic foundations
