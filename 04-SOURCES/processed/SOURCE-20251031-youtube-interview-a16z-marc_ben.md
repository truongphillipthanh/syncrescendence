# State of AI - Runtime Keynote

## Executive Summary
Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz argue that AI is not a bubble—it's a real platform shift with $200B+ in hyperscaler capex spending on actual infrastructure. On creativity: 99.99% of humans aren't truly creative either; if AI clears that bar, it's equivalent. On intelligence vs power: raw IQ correlates poorly with leadership; judgment, charisma, and emotional intelligence matter more. AI is the biggest platform shift ever because it expands what computers can do, not just who uses them. On China: US leads in conceptual breakthroughs but China excels at implementation; robotics phase could favor China's manufacturing ecosystem.

## Key Insights

### Not a Bubble—Real Infrastructure
Bubbles disconnect valuation from fundamentals. Current AI investment is the opposite: $50-100B in real data centers, chips, productive capacity. Hyperscalers are rebuilding products around AI because they see real results. Companies going from zero to tens of millions in 12-18 months using AI. This is value creation, not speculation.

### Creativity is Remixing
Hip-hop is 100% samples—Paul's Boutique has 300 samples yet is considered a masterpiece of originality. The Beatles remixed Chuck Berry. Led Zeppelin remixed blues. Creativity is remixing in interesting ways. AI can do this. Ultimate test: does it stand the test of time?

### Intelligence ≠ Power
Correlation between IQ and leadership/impact is weak. Leadership requires emotional intelligence, theory of mind, charisma, motivation ability, decision-making under uncertainty, courage, persistence. Super intelligent AI won't automatically rule the world—ruling requires understanding human psychology, building institutions, navigating politics.

### Biggest Platform Shift Ever
Previous shifts (mainframe→PC→web→mobile) changed interface and distribution. AI changes what computers can do. Things requiring human intelligence—writing, reasoning, creativity—computers can now do. Every cognitive work process is up for grabs.

### The Narrative Memory Gap
Current AI has good theory of mind on tests but struggles with emotional depth. The key gap: persistent long-term memory creating identity over time.

### Technology is Shifting Too Fast
Foundation models improve month by month. Build around customer problems, not specific technical approaches. What you built six months ago may be obsolete. Distribution matters more than technical differentiation because barriers to entry are low.

### US vs China Race
US leads in conceptual breakthroughs; China excels at implementation and commoditization (3-6 month lag). Robotics phase is scarier—China has industrial ecosystem for mechanical/electrical/semiconductor devices. Even if US stays ahead in software, China could lap us in hardware.

### Talent and Chips Will Ease
Current shortage of AI talent is temporary—China's Deepseek/Qwen teams are not the famous researchers, suggesting training pipelines work. Every chip shortage creates a glut as margins attract competition.

## Quotable Passages
> "If these things clear the bar of 99.99% of humanity, that's pretty interesting just in and of itself." — Marc Andreessen

> "Just because an AI is really smart doesn't mean it's going to be able to lead people or motivate people or understand people or build coalitions." — Marc Andreessen

> "This is now a full-on race. It's a foot race. It's a game of inches. We're not going to have a five-year lead. We're going to have maybe a six-month lead." — Marc Andreessen
