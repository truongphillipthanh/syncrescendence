# No Priors: The Best of 2025 (So Far)

## Executive Summary
Compilation of key insights from No Priors interviews throughout 2025. Highlights: Harvey discovered GPT-3 could produce lawyer-quality answers 86/100 times before anyone knew; Fei-Fei Li's spatial intelligence thesis (3D world reconstruction is hardest problem evolution solved); Mercor CEO predicts painful displacement with political populist movement; Dan Hendrycks on superintelligence geopolitics requiring new international coordination; OpenAI researchers on reasoning models exhibiting metacognition; Glean built in "graveyard market" because SaaS unlocked enterprise data access.

## Key Insights

### Harvey Discovery (Winston Weinberg)
GPT-3 tested on 100 landlord-tenant questions from r/legaladvice. Three attorneys said 86/100 answers were good enough to send to clients without edits. "I had no idea the models were this good at legal" —OpenAI general counsel response.

### Spatial Intelligence (Fei-Fei Li)
Spatial intelligence is the hardest problem evolution had to solve—reconstructing 3D world from 2D light collection (eyes). Humans still can't easily generate complicated 3D models mentally without training. World Labs building "imagine at your fingertip" capability.

### Displacement Reality (Brendan Foody)
Displacement in many roles "going to happen very quickly and be very painful and a large political problem." Expects big populist movement. Physical world work persists longer (robotics data creators, waiters, therapists). Digital automation faster because of "self-reinforcing gains and self-improvement."

### Superintelligence Geopolitics (Dan Hendrycks)
Different from nuclear MAD because: (1) capability concentration in few actors, (2) controllability questions at capability thresholds, (3) speed of development. Needs: international coordination mechanisms, verification protocols, solving racing dynamics where slowing down = losing.

### Reasoning Models (OpenAI: McKinzie, Mitchell)
Models learning to "break problems down, consider multiple approaches, self-correct." Exhibiting something like metacognition—reflecting on own reasoning, identifying wrong paths. But still limitations: "can appear to be reasoning when really following learned patterns."

### Deep Research Training (Isa Fulford)
Training models for research assistant quality: finding sources, synthesizing information, understanding good research questions. Hardest part: teaching models what "depth" means—when to stop accumulating surface-level information.

### Graveyard Market Success (Arvind Jain)
Enterprise search was "graveyard of companies." SaaS was the unlock—no more data center access problems. One customer has 1 billion documents (same as entire internet in 2004). Cloud era enables scale that wasn't possible before.

### Human Impact (Shiv Rao)
Doctor feedback: "I was sitting at dinner and my son asked why I wasn't working. I explained Abridge lets mommy come home early." Husband: "Mommy's going to eat dinner with us every night now." Purpose-driven development sustained by oxytocin hits, not just dopamine of hypergrowth.

### Entrepreneurship Thesis (Noubar Afeyan)
"Entrepreneurship is not about taking risks—it's about taking calculated leaps where you can see further than others." Start with "what if?" questions that seem unreasonable. "Real breakthroughs happen when you push into territory of what seems implausible."

## Quotable Passages
> "86 out of 100 was yes. We cold emailed the general counsel of OpenAI and his response was, 'I had no idea the models were this good at legal.'" — Winston Weinberg

> "Displacement in a lot of roles is going to happen very quickly and it's going to be very painful and a large political problem." — Brendan Foody

> "Mommy's going to be able to eat dinner with us every night now." — Doctor feedback via Abridge
