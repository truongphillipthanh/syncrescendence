### Post 1: Coordinator Feature
**Feb 19, 2026**
One of my favorite features is to create a "coordinator". Just create a parent directory/repo that has lots of related projects under it. They are all excluded via .gitignore from the parent and each have their own git repo. These are not git submodules (🤮) Just simple directories, I generally have a root AGENTS/CLAUDE file to describe the structure.
Dmux will detect these sub-repositories and when you create a worktree in the root, will also create worktrees of all those sub-directories in the parent directory worktree. When you merge it will let you merge each of the children's worktrees.
For OSS maintainers like myself, with many related projects, this is a real game changer.

### Post 3: Inter-Agent Communication
**Feb 19, 2026**
This doesn't add any extra layers to the existing coding agents because each already has their own capacity for inter-agent and sub-agent communication.
---
### Post 4: Tmux Details
**Feb 19, 2026**
Tmux is perfect for all this stuff because it runs in a server and allows a full programming layer on top of it. We even have an experimental "autopilot" mode that can read the tmux stream and have an LLM help steer the AI. Also if your terminal crashes, no problem, just open a new one, go back to the directory, and run dmux and all your sessions will still be running.

### Post 6: Branch Handling
**Feb 19, 2026**
If you're in a branch it creates the worktree as a branch off that

### Post 7: Dev-Centric Approach
**Feb 19, 2026**
More dev-centric. I'm personally a fan of TUI interfaces for most dev stuff, tmux is a boss too, if your terminal crashes for example, your agent sessions just keep running.
And as TUI you can just use CC/Codex however you normally would

### Post 8: Conflict Resolution
**Feb 20, 2026**
It'll ask you if you want to spin up another agent pane to resolve the conflicts
---
### Post 9: Tmux Configuration
**Feb 20, 2026**
Depends how you setup tmux. If you used our config you can click on it, or use ctrl-option and an arrow to navigate between panes. If you didn't use our tmux config, lookup pane switching in tmux

### Post 12: Real Codebase Question
**Feb 19, 2026**
what's a "real" codebase, and why would one not work on your own machine?
Also, its just tmux, you can run it on any server if thats your cup o tea
