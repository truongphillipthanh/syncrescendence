## Description (no transcript available)

This final episode of 2025 lays out a practical, self-guided 10-week plan to build real AI fluency by actually doing the work. Each weekend focuses on a concrete project—from model mapping and deep research to data analysis, visual reasoning, automations, context engineering, and building a real AI-powered app—designed to be modular, completable in a few hours, and immediately useful. The goal isn’t theory or trends, but habits, workflows, and systems that still matter months from now, setting a foundation for how AI fits into work and life heading into 2026.
