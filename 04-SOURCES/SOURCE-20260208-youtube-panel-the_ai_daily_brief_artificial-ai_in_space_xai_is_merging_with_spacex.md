## Description (no transcript available)

Elon Musk's merger of XAI and SpaceX fuses AI model development with rocket and satellite infrastructure, reshaping competition and IPO math. Orbital data centers are pitched as cheaper, more efficient paths to terawatt-scale compute through passive cooling and direct solar power, while regulatory approval and orbital-debris risks loom large. Public reaction splits between techno-optimism about space-scale AI and sharp skepticism over financial motives, investor dilution, and the spectacle around Grok.
