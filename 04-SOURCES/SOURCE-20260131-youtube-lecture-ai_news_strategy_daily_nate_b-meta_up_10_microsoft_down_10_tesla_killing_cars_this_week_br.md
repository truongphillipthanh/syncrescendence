What's really happening with this week's biggest AI moves? The common story is that companies are still exploring AI potential—but the reality is more complicated when $135 billion in infrastructure spending hits earnings calls.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why the AI conversation shifted from potential to irreversible commitment:

 • Why Meta jumped 10% and Microsoft dropped 11% on similar AI spending news
 • How Waymo's response to striking a child missed the accountability question
 • What Tesla discontinuing Model S and X reveals about its robotics pivot
 • Where Anthropic's $350 billion valuation signals enterprise AI momentum

For builders watching the AI labor market, the through line is clear—the phase where companies could talk about AI potential is ending, and what remains is execution against bets too big to walk back.
