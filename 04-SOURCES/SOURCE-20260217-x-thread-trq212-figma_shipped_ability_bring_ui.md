# Claude Code to Figma Integration
Figma just shipped the ability to bring UI work done in Claude Code straight into Figma as editable design frames.
Use this to explore new ideas in Figma, view multi-page flows on the canvas, or reimagine user experiences.
(Description: Embedded video demonstration showing the Claude Code to Figma workflow. The video displays a split-screen interface with Claude Code on the left side showing "Welcome to Claude Code!" with code snippets and a Figma welcome screen on the right side with "Claude Code to Figma" heading. The interface demonstrates the seamless transfer of UI designs from Claude Code into Figma as editable design frames, visualizing all states of the onboarding flow and push each screen to Figma with a "Personalizing..." status indicator.)
