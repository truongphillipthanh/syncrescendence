# Style Dropper Thread

**Post 1 — Feb 10, 2026, 1:10 PM**

We made a tool that lets you absorb the vibe of anything you point it at and apply it to your designs It's absurd and it just works Style Dropper, now available in @variantui

We grew up on Kid Pix and MS Paint, and wanted to instill Style Dropper with that same sense of magic

(And yes, it really does look that cool in Variant)
