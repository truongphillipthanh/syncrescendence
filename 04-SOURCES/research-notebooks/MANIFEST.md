## Notes

- File counts exceed the taxonomy's base assignments (255) because 32 "Remaining Files" from the taxonomy's edge-case table were merged into their assigned primary notebooks.
- One file (`20260206-x_article-i_built_an_ai_company_with_openclaw_vercel_supabase_two_weeks_later_they_run_it_themselves-@voxyz_ai.md`) was not explicitly listed in the taxonomy but was present in the source corpus; assigned to NB6 (Multi-Agent Orchestration) based on author and content affinity.
- Original files at `/Users/system/Desktop/research/` remain untouched (267 files).
- Files with special characters in filenames (quotes, leading spaces, internal spaces) were handled correctly:
  - `"20260207-x_article-the_compounding_creative_four_stages_that_separate_who_survives_the_ai_era_from_who_doesn't-@_vvsvs.md"` (NB14)
  - `'20260204-x_article-why_we_must_break_the_world-@profbuehlermi t.md'` (NB14)
  - `'20260207-x_thread-introducing_onecontext_i_built_it-@jundemorsen wu.md'` (NB3)
  - `' 20260211-x_thread-reflecting_on_what_engineers_love-@bcherny.md'` (NB8)
