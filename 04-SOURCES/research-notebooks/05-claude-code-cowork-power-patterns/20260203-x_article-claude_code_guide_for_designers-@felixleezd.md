# Claude Code Guide for Designers

Claude Code is the highest leverage skill you can learn this year. The future of design is here. I've written a full guide for this.

## Story time...

I built my personal website, with an AI chat that answers questions about my work, in 48 hours. Three days later, I shipped a growth design tool.

I'm not a developer. I'm a designer. A year ago, I couldn't ship a single line of code without an engineer. Now I deploy products on weekends.

Same person, different tool (no more Figma, kinda)!

This is the complete guide to using Claude Code as a designer -> step by step, command by command.

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is a coding agent. You give it instructions in plain English, and it writes code for you. You prompt: "Create a landing page with a hero section, three feature cards, and a footer." It executes.

Or something like. "Add an AI chat widget that answers questions about my portfolio." It executes. You don't need to understand syntax. You need to understand what you're building.

Imho, this is even better than Cursor or anything else out there (as of today).

## > things I've built

### ⭐️ Project 1: Tetris game

Okay, this one is insane: I built a Tetris game using only Figma MCP connected to FigJam, then back to Claude Code. I did not even design or touch a single line of code.

No joke, this one blew me away (see my reaction at 7s). 😂

(Description: Embedded video showing a Tetris game interface with colorful falling blocks in multiple colors (orange, purple, blue, cyan, green, yellow, pink), a score display showing "684", level indicator showing "1", and lines counter showing "3". A user reactions appears in the bottom right corner showing someone's face during gameplay.)

### ⭐️ Project 2: Growth design tool

(Description: Embedded video showing a design analyzer dashboard interface with a circular score of "82", summary section, and financial infrastructure components. The interface displays colorful gradient elements in orange, pink, and purple tones, with charts and metrics for analyzing website UI performance including conversion rate, UX, and copy analysis.)

An internal tool for analyzing metrics and suggesting design experiments. Database-backed. User authentication. AI-powered recommendations. 3 days. Working product. Live on the internet.

How insane, got over 500 users now!

## Now, let's get you up to speed on these.

### > step 1: install Claude Code

**On Mac:** Open Terminal (search "Terminal" in Spotlight) and run:
```plaintext
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

If you don't have npm, install Node.js first from https://nodejs.org

**Verify installation:** Type ->
```plaintext
claude
```

Claude Code should launch. You'll see a text interface where you can start typing instructions.

(Description: Terminal screenshot showing Claude Code v2.1.12 interface with "Welcome back Felix!" greeting, a pixelated user icon, organization information showing "Opus 4.5 - Claude Max - felix@adplist.org", and a tips section for getting started with commands like "Run /init to create a CLAUDE_..." with recent activity showing "No recent activity".)

**(NEW) Alternatively,** you can download the desktop mac app for Claude Code as per video shown below. You'll need an Anthropic account (sign up at claude.ai if you don't have one). The link to download is here.

(Description: macOS desktop window screenshot showing the Claude Code desktop application interface with menu items for "Files", "Projects", "Drafts", and "Artifacts" in a sidebar, and a welcome message "Hey there, Elliot" displayed in the main content area.)

### > step 2: basic terminal commands

Claude Code runs in the terminal. Here's what you need to know:
```plaintext
claude # Start Claude Code
cd folder-name # Navigate into a folder
cd .. # Go back one folder
ls # List files (Mac)
dir # List files (Windows)
pwd # Show current location (Mac)
```

That's it. You don't need anything more than this to get started.

### > step 3: create your first project

**Create a project folder (aka directory):**
```plaintext
mkdir my-portfolio
cd my-portfolio
claude
```

Now you're inside Claude Code, in your project folder.

**Start with a plan ALWAYS (critical):**
```plaintext
Before writing any code, ask for a plan:

I want to build a personal portfolio website with:
- A hero section with my name and tagline
- A projects section showing 4 recent works
- An about section with my bio
- A contact section with links to Twitter and LinkedIn

Research the best way to build this and create a plan.md file with:
1. Recommended tech stack
2. File structure
3. Design considerations
4. Step-by-step implementation plan
```

Claude Code creates a plan.md file. Open it and review.

**Adjust if needed:**
```plaintext
In the plan, change the tech stack to vanilla HTML/CSS instead of React. Keep it simple.
```

**Implement:**

Implement this project according to plan.md. Start with the HTML structure, then add CSS styling.

Watch as files appear: index.html, styles.css, images/.

**Preview locally:** How do I preview this in my browser?

For a local server:
```plaintext
npx serve
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### > step 4: iterate through prompts

This is where designers have an advantage. You already know how to give feedback.

**Styling:**
```plaintext
Make the hero section full-height (100vh). Center the text vertically.
The projects section looks cramped. Add more padding between cards — at least 32px.
Add a subtle hover effect on the project cards.
Scale up slightly and add a shadow.
Change the font to Inter from Google Fonts.
```

**Responsiveness:**
```plaintext
Make it responsive.
On mobile, stack the project cards vertically.
The navigation should collapse into a hamburger menu on screens under 768px.
```

**Functionality:**
```plaintext
Add smooth scroll behavior when clicking navigation links.
Add a contact form that sends submissions to my email using Formspree.
```

**Debugging:** Each prompt → code change → refresh browser. The loop is fast.

### > step 5: commit (aka save) to GitHub

**Create a GitHub account:** Go to https://github.com and sign up (free).

**Create a repository:**
- Click + → New repository
- Name it (e.g., my-portfolio)
- Keep it Public or Private
- Don't initialize with README
- Click Create repository

Copy the repository URL.

**Connect and push:**

In Claude Code:

Initialize git in this project and connect it to my GitHub repository: https://github.com/yourusername/my-portfolio.git

Or manually:
```plaintext
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-portfolio.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

**Create documentation:**

Create a README.md that explains what this project is and how to run it locally.

Create a claude.md file that describes the project architecture and context for future sessions.

Your code is now saved and versioned.

### > step 6: go live/deploy to Vercel

(Description: Screenshot of Vercel dashboard showing project deployment interface with sections for "Deployments", "Observability", and "Analytics". The dashboard displays deployment status, active branches, and various metrics visualizations including line charts showing performance data and trend analysis.)

**Create a Vercel account:** Go to https://vercel.com and sign up with GitHub.

**Option 1 Vercel dashboard:**
1. Click Add New → Project
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Click Deploy

**Option 2 through Claude Code:**

Deploy this project to Vercel.

**Result:** You get a live URL like my-portfolio-abc123.vercel.app

**NOTE:** Your site is on the internet. Every future push to GitHub auto-deploys.

### > step 7: add your custom domain

**In Vercel:**
- Go to Settings → Domains
- Add your domain (e.g., yourname.com)
- Vercel shows DNS records to add

**Update DNS at your domain provider:**
```plaintext
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

Wait 5-30 minutes. Your site loads on your custom domain.

### > step 8: build into a web app (advanced)

Static sites are steps 1-7. Now let's add users, data, and AI.

**Research prompt:**

I want to expand this portfolio into a web app with:
- Google sign-in authentication
- An AI chat widget that answers questions about my work
- A comment section where signed-in users can leave messages

Research the best approach and create an implementation-plan.md with:
1. Services needed (auth, database, AI)
2. Architecture overview
3. Security considerations
4. Step-by-step implementation phases

**Set up environment variables:**

Create a .env file for storing API keys. Also create a .gitignore that excludes .env from GitHub.

Your .env file:
```plaintext
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyxxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx
```

🚨 Never commit this file.

### > step 9: supabase (database + auth)

**Create a project:**
1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Create new project
3. Go to Settings → API
4. Copy Project URL and anon key

**Enable Google sign-in:**
1. In Supabase: Authentication → Providers → Google → Enable
2. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
3. Create project → APIs & Services → Credentials → Create OAuth Client ID
4. Copy Client ID back to Supabase

### > step 10: add ai features with OpenAI

**Get API key:**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com
2. Create an API key

**Store securely in Supabase:**

Go to Settings → Edge Functions → Add Secret

- Name: OPENAI_API_KEY
- Value: your key

This keeps the key server-side, never exposed to users.

**Implementation prompt:**

Implement the web app according to implementation-plan.md. Use:
- Supabase for auth and database (credentials in .env)
- OpenAI for the chat feature (key stored in Supabase Edge Functions)
- Google sign-in only

Start with authentication, then add the AI chat, then the comment system.

Then redeploy!

## Final Thought...

I used to feel like half a builder. Like my ideas needed someone else to become real. Not anymore.

It's time to build, designers.
