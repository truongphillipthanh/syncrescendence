# the skill that changed how i use claude for marketing

(Description: ASCII art visualization with folder icon labeled "marketing skills" - representing conceptual knowledge organization)

it's called a recursive self-improvement loop. and once you understand it, you'll never prompt the normal way again.

## How It Works

i've been using this with amazing results lately. here's how it works:

most people prompt claude once and ship whatever comes back. a recursive skill works differently.

it generates, evaluates its own output against a scoring criteria, diagnoses what's weak, rewrites, and re-evaluates. it keeps looping until it actually hits the bar.

### Example

@maxwellfinn shared an image ad skill that scores every concept against 10 criterias like thumb-stop power, curiosity gap, emotional trigger, persona recognition. if it scores below 9/10, it doesn't stop. it tells you exactly why it failed, rewrites the concept, and re-scores. over and over until it passes.

## The Pattern Works for Everything

- **email sequences**: generates the full drip, then stress-tests every subject line, hook, and cta against the same loop.
- **video hooks**: evaluates the first 3 seconds against retention psychology. does it create a curiosity gap? does it pattern-interrupt? if a distracted scroller would keep scrolling, it rewrites and retests.
- **positioning**: stress-tests your angle against competitors, skeptical buyers, and market saturation. if a rival cmo could rip it apart, it finds the gap and repositions until the angle is unattackable.
- **seo content**: evaluates against search intent, depth, and competitive gap. if a top-ranking piece already says the same thing, it finds the angle they missed and rebuilds around that.

## The Core Pattern

the pattern is always the same: **generate → evaluate → diagnose → improve → repeat**.

## How to Build One

1. **Pick one marketing task** you do repeatedly. landing pages, ad copy, emails.. whatever you run most often.

2. **Write down how you personally evaluate** that output. what do you look for? what makes you say "this is good" vs "this is mid"? those criteria become your scoring checklist.

3. **Turn each criterion into a pass/fail threshold**. be specific. "thumb-stop power: 9/10 minimum" is a threshold. "make it good" is not.

4. **Build the loop**. tell claude: generate the output, score it against the checklist, diagnose any failures, rewrite, and re-score. do not stop until every criterion passes.

5. **Add adversarial pressure**. give claude a persona that attacks the output. a skeptical customer, a competitor, a distracted buyer. if the output survives the attack, it ships. if not, it iterates.

6. **Save it as a reusable skill**. now you're not prompting from scratch every time. you have a system that runs the same standard on every output.

## What's Next

i'm building a full library of these recursive skills for marketing teams. follow if you want them as they drop.
