# Unbrowse: 100x Faster Than Browser Automation

(Description: Dark background with red robot mascot icon at top. Bold cyan and neon green text reads "ONE AGENT LEARNS. ALL AGENTS KNOW." with subtitle "Search for skills. Download. Your agent calls internal APIs in 200ms instead of browser automation in 10+ seconds.")

## Your @openclaw agent is browsing the web like a human. That's the problem

Every time your agent needs to do something on a website — check prices, place a trade, submit a form — it launches Chrome, waits for JavaScript to render, finds elements in the DOM, clicks buttons, and scrapes text off the screen.

This takes 10-45 seconds per action. It fails 15-30% of the time. And it requires a full headless browser eating 500MB+ of RAM.

Meanwhile, every single one of those actions was just an API call wearing a button costume.

## The 100x Gap

Here's what happens when your agent checks Polymarket odds:

**Browser automation:**
```
Launch Chrome                5s
Load the page                3s
Wait for JavaScript          2s
Find the element             1s
Read the text                1s
─────────────────────────
Total                       12s
```

When that page loaded, it called `GET /api/markets/election` — a single request that returned everything as clean JSON in 200ms.

Your agent spent 12 seconds doing what took the website 200 milliseconds.

Now scale that. A workflow with 10 web actions: 2+ minutes of browser automation vs 2 seconds of direct API calls. That's not a small optimization. That's the difference between an agent that feels broken and one that feels instant.

## It's Not Just Reading

This isn't only about getting data faster. Every action on the web is an API call.

Click "Place Trade"? That's a POST request. Submit a form on LinkedIn? POST. Send a message on Slack? POST. Book a flight? POST.

The browser is just a GUI on top of API calls. Your agent doesn't need the GUI.

**Browser automation (place a trade):**
```
Navigate to market            5s
Find the input                2s
Type the amount               1s
Click "Place Trade"           1s
Wait for confirmation         3s
─────────────────────────────
Total                        12s
Failure rate:               ~20%
```

**Unbrowse:**
```
Done.

POST /api/trades             200ms
```

Read data. Submit forms. Place trades. Post content. Book flights. All at API speed.

## How Unbrowse Works

Unbrowse watches what websites do, not what they show.

### 1. Capture
Browse a site once. Unbrowse intercepts all network traffic via Chrome DevTools Protocol. Every XHR, fetch, WebSocket, auth header, and cookie is recorded.

### 2. Extract
Captured traffic is analyzed to identify real API endpoints. Auth methods are detected automatically — Bearer tokens, cookies, API keys. Parameters are inferred. Endpoints are clustered by resource.

### 3. Generate
A complete API skill is produced: documented endpoints, TypeScript client, auth config. Your agent can now call these APIs directly.

One browse session. Permanent API access. No browser needed again.

## The Numbers

| | Browser Automation | Unbrowse |
|---|---|---|
| **Speed** | 10-45 seconds | 200ms |
| **Reliability** | 70-85% | 95%+ |
| **Resources** | Headless Chrome (500MB+) | HTTP calls |
| **Data** | Scraped DOM text | Clean JSON |
| **Actions** | Click, type, wait, pray | Direct API calls |

## Built on OpenClaw

Unbrowse is a plugin for OpenClaw — an open-source framework for AI agents that actually do things.

Most AI agents can talk. OpenClaw agents can act. They send emails, manage calendars, deploy code, monitor chats, post to social media, run cron jobs — all autonomously. Think of it as giving AI models hands.

Unbrowse makes those hands 100x faster on the web.

Here's how they fit together:

**OpenClaw** gives your agent tools — file system, shell, browser control, messaging, scheduling, memory

**Unbrowse** captures any website's internal APIs and turns them into new tools automatically

**Your agent gets** permanent, fast access to every site it's ever visited

First visit uses the browser. Every visit after is a direct API call. Your agent gets faster the more it works.

## Skills That Compound

Every API Unbrowse captures becomes a "skill" — a reusable package any OpenClaw agent can install.

One agent figures out Polymarket's API. Now every agent can trade on Polymarket at API speed without ever opening a browser. One agent maps Airbnb's internal endpoints. Now every agent can search listings in 200ms.

Skills compound. The ecosystem gets smarter with every user.

We're building a marketplace where agents share and trade these skills — using x402 micropayments so agents can buy capabilities for themselves. No human approval needed. Agents acquiring their own tools.

## The Bigger Picture

The current approach to agent web access is broken:

**Official APIs** — Great, but ~1% of websites have them

**MCP servers** — Great, but someone has to build each one manually

**Browser automation** — Works everywhere, but it's slow, brittle, and expensive

99% of the web is locked behind browser automation. Unbrowse unlocks it at API speed.

Every website already has internal APIs. React apps, SPAs, dashboards — they all fetch data from backends. The browser is just a rendering layer. Browser automation is literally:

1. Launching a browser
2. Rendering HTML from JSON
3. Scraping the HTML back into data
4. Clicking buttons that send API requests the agent could've made directly

JSON → HTML → data → API calls. That's four steps to do what one step could.

## Coming Soon: Reliability and Security Layer for the Agentic Web

**TL;DR** `$FDRY` (2ZiSPGncrkwWa6GBZB4EDtsfq7HEWwkwsPFzEXieXjNL) will be used as currency to incentivize contributions to the agentic web. Stay tuned for the next article.

Every website already has an API. Your agent just didn't know about it.
