# Vibe Coding is Dead. Here's What Comes Next.

(Description: Article header featuring a geometric 3D cube icon in grayscale, accompanied by text in yellow and white caps reading "VIBE CODING IS DEAD. HERE'S WHAT COMES NEXT." against a dark background)

Vibe coding was fun while it lasted.

Open Cursor. Type a prompt. Watch the magic happen. Ship something in a weekend.

I get it. I've done it. We've all done it.

But if you're still building like this in 2026, you're falling behind. Fast.

I've spent over a year building software with AI. Shipped 45+ MVPs for clients at the agency. Made every mistake vibe coders make and then some.

What I learned changed how I think about AI coding entirely.

This is the shift nobody's talking about. And the gap between vibe coders and real builders is about to get massive.

## We're in the Third Era of Software

Most people don't realize how big this moment is.

Software 1.0 was traditional code. Writing instructions that computers execute. This is how virtually all software was built since the 1940s.

Software 2.0 came around 2012. Neural networks. Weights and parameters programming behavior instead of explicit code.

Now we're in Software 3.0. Prompts. Plain English. You can program how an LLM behaves just by talking to it.

This only became possible around 2019 with GPT-2. We're barely five years in.

Here's why this matters:

In the '90s, plenty of businesses thought they could ignore the internet. They're gone now.

Today, plenty of people are ignoring the AI coding revolution. Same energy. Same outcome.

My message is simple: Don't ignore this. Sit down. Push through the friction. Learn how to code with AI properly.

## Vibe Coding vs AI Coding

Let me be clear about something.

Vibe coding and AI coding are not the same thing.

Vibe coding is blindly using AI. No planning. No review. No process. You prompt, you accept, you move on.

The result? Sloppy code. Security holes. Endless technical debt.

Technical debt is one of the worst things that can happen to a codebase. It means you have no idea what the code is doing. No idea what each file is for. No idea how anything connects.

This is why most vibe-coded apps never make it to production.

And the few that do? Most don't survive past 60 days. They're not maintainable. They're definitely not scalable.

AI coding is different.

The goal is to build serious, production-ready software. Apps that people actually use. Apps that can be developed for months or years without falling apart.

Human strategy. AI implementation. Rigorous review.

That's the formula.

## Why Most Vibe-Coded Apps Fail

I've seen this pattern dozens of times.

Someone builds an app in a weekend. Posts it on Twitter. Gets some likes. Feels great.

Then real users show up.

The app breaks at 100 users. There's a race condition nobody caught. The database schema makes no sense. Auth is held together with duct tape.

They try to fix it. But they can't. Because they have no idea how the codebase works. They didn't build it with intention. They just accepted whatever the AI gave them.

Technical debt compounds. Every fix creates two new problems.

Eventually they give up. Start over. Or quit entirely.

This is the vibe coding cycle. And it's a trap.

## How the Best Actually Do It

Here's something most people don't know.

At Nvidia, Meta, and Google, nearly all engineers use AI now. At Nvidia, it's 100%.

But they use AI very differently than vibe coders.

Every engineer is assisted by AI. Their productivity has gone up massively. But the humans are still in charge.

They're not asking AI what to build. They're telling it.

They're not accepting code blindly. They're reviewing everything.

They're not delegating decisions. They're making them.

The AI is a tool. The human is the builder.

That's the difference.

## The Opportunity is Insane

Let me put some numbers on this.

The B2B SaaS industry is about $230 billion annually. That's big.

But companies spend about $5.5 trillion on knowledge workers every year. That's labor. People doing tasks.

Here's the shift:

Historically, software could only take up the software market. Code does what you tell it to do. Nothing more.

But AI agents can do entire tasks now. Series of tasks. Which is basically a job.

What is a job? If you hire someone for customer support, it's just a series of tasks. AI can do that now.

This means the software market is expanding into the labor market.

$230 billion is big. $5.5 trillion is massive. And that's just America.

We're looking at the biggest economic opportunity in history. I'm not exaggerating.

The people who learn to build properly with AI will capture a piece of this. The people who keep vibe coding will wonder what happened.

## The Right Way to Use AI

So how do you actually do this?

The biggest mistake people make is not staying in charge.

When I build inside Cursor or Lovable, I'm the one leading development. Always.

I decide the scope. I decide the UI layout. I decide the tech stack. I decide the codebase structure.

I describe the vision. I don't ask the AI what features to add or how to structure things.

This might be tempting if you're a beginner. "Let the AI figure it out."

That's one of the worst mistakes you can make.

When you delegate decisions to AI, two things happen:

First, you build mediocre software. The AI gives you what's average on the internet. Nothing unique. Nothing differentiated.

Second, you get lost. You have no idea what tech stack you're using or why. You have no idea how the codebase is structured. Technical debt explodes.

Here's what I do instead:

If I don't know how to make a decision, I ask the AI for options.

"Give me four possible tech stacks for this idea. Explain the pros and cons of each."

Then I choose.

That one extra step makes a massive difference. You learn the art of making decisions. You stay in control. You actually understand what you're building.

## Skills That Actually Matter Now

AI is great at certain things.

Writing code. Being efficient. Solving problems that have been solved many times before.

But AI is terrible at other things.

Creating unique ideas. Knowing how your app will actually be used. Having taste. Having judgment.

These are human skills. And they matter more than ever.

The people winning with AI aren't the ones prompting the most. They're the ones thinking the clearest.

Learn software design. Learn system architecture. Understand the high-level concepts.

When you combine human strategy with AI execution, you move infinitely faster than someone with zero technical understanding.

That's the edge.

## The Gap is About to Explode

Here's what I see coming.

Right now, everyone's playing with AI. Vibe coding is everywhere. Most of what's being built is garbage.

But a small group of people are learning to do this properly. Planning before prompting. Reviewing before shipping. Building systems, not just apps.

In 12 months, the gap between these two groups will be massive.

The vibe coders will still be rebuilding the same app for the fifth time. The real builders will be shipping production software, getting users, making money.

Same tools. Completely different outcomes.

The difference isn't talent. It's process.

## The Bet I'm Making

I'm betting everything on AI coding done right.

Human strategy. AI implementation. Rigorous review.

That's the formula I use at the agency. That's what I teach in my community. That's how I think about building now.

Vibe coding was a phase. It was fun. It got people excited about AI.

But the phase is ending.

What comes next is real software. Built faster than ever. But built properly.

The opportunity is massive. The window is open. But it won't stay open forever.

Learn the fundamentals. Build the systems. Ship with intention.

That's the play.

## TLDR

→ We're in Software 3.0. Prompts are programming now.

→ Vibe coding = no planning, no review, no process. Most apps fail.

→ AI coding = human strategy + AI implementation + rigorous review.

→ Big companies use AI differently. Humans lead, AI follows.

→ The market opportunity is insane. Software is eating into the $5.5T labor market.

→ Stay in charge. You decide scope, tech stack, structure. AI executes.

→ AI is great at code. Bad at ideas, taste, and judgment. Those are your edge.

→ The gap between vibe coders and real builders is about to explode.

→ Learn the fundamentals. Build systems. Ship with intention.
