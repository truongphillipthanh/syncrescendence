## Description (no transcript available)

DRAM shortage is causing huge price hike in consumer hardware including RAM, SSD, Flash, Non-Volatile storage. The demand in AI is driving memory constraint from memory manufacturers like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron that are suppliers and manufacturers of all memory types from GDDR to HBM in Nvidia and AMD graphics cards.
As in the industry shifts due to large demand of artificial intelligence, the entire economy of how the memory business works is slowly shifting as these plants shifts their focus away from lower margin product to now a high margin memory as demand picks up.
