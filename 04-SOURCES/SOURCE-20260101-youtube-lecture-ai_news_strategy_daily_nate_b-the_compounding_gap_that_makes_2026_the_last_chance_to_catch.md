What's really happening with AI in 2026 that most leaders are missing? The common story is that AI will gradually make everyone more productive — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share ten specific AI predictions that trace back to what we already know today:
- Why memory breakthroughs and agent UI surfaces will arrive by mid-2026
- How continual learning and recursive self-improvement will reshape LLMs
- What long-running AI agents mean when humans become the bottleneck
- Where work AI and personal AI split into completely different experiences

Chapters:

0:00 Introduction 
0:35 Prediction 1: Memory Breakthrough 
02:23 Prediction 2: Agent Software UI Breakthrough 
04:42 Prediction 3: Continual Learning Rollout 
06:06 Prediction 4: Recursive Self-Improvement 
06:25 Prediction 5: Very Long Running Agents 
08:43 Prediction 6: AI Reviewing AI Work 
10:38 Prediction 7: Work AI vs Personal AI Split 
12:51 Prediction 8: Non-Technical Work Becomes Engineering-Shaped 
15:04 Prediction 9: Power Law of Adoption Persists
16:03 Prediction 10: Proactive AI Systems 

The gap between fast-adopting companies and everyone else will widen dramatically, creating both Predator-level advantages for disruptors and existential risk for slow movers. The workforce retraining challenge in 2026 will exceed the previous twenty-five years combined.
