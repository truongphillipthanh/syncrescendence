# Interface Theory of Perception and Consciousness

## Executive Summary
Donald Hoffman (cognitive scientist, UC Irvine) presents a radical thesis: perception evolved not to show reality but to hide it. Natural selection favors organisms that perceive fitness-relevant information, not truth. Our perceptions are like a desktop interface—useful but not veridical. Spacetime itself is a species-specific interface, not objective reality. Consciousness may be fundamental, with physical reality emergent from conscious agents interacting.

## Key Insights

### Fitness Beats Truth Theorem
Evolutionary game-theoretic simulations show organisms that perceive fitness payoffs reliably outcompete organisms that perceive truth. Evolution optimizes for survival, not accuracy. Truth perception is selected against because tracking fitness requires less computational overhead than tracking objective reality.

### Interface Theory of Perception
Perception is like a computer desktop—icons represent files but are not the files themselves. Similarly, our perceptions represent fitness-relevant features but do not resemble objective reality. Space, time, and physical objects are interface elements, not fundamental reality.

### Spacetime as Interface
Even spacetime is part of the interface. Hoffman argues spacetime is a data structure our species uses to organize fitness-relevant information. Different species may use radically different data structures. Quantum mechanics and general relativity fail to unify precisely because spacetime is not fundamental.

### Consciousness as Fundamental
If perception doesn't show reality, what is reality? Hoffman proposes conscious agents as fundamental. Physical reality (matter, energy, spacetime) emerges from interactions between conscious agents. This inverts the standard physicalist view where consciousness emerges from matter.

### Conscious Realism
Hoffman's mathematical framework: reality consists of conscious agents (each with internal states, perceptions, actions, and dynamics) interacting in networks. What we call physical reality is the projection of this agent network into our species-specific interface (spacetime).

### Implications for AI Consciousness
If consciousness is fundamental, AI systems built on different substrates could be conscious in their own way. The question isn't whether silicon can produce consciousness but whether the functional organization of AI implements the same dynamics as conscious agents.

## Transcript

Most of us assume that what you see is
what you get. We assume that the moon is
there even if you don't look. The bottom
line is the probability is zero.
>> All right? So reality is not the way
that we perceive it.
>> You don't see the truth. The reason is
because it's infinitely complicated. If
a tree falls in the forest and no one's
around to perceive it, does it still
make a sound? This has been a big
problem in science until I discovered
the trace logic. And just 6 months ago,
I think I found the key that I've been
looking for for 40 years. This is the
first time I've actually talked about
this. But the interesting thing is
spiritual traditions have been saying
this for thousands of years. And now the
best science says that the best science
does not say you're just a lump of atoms
that happens to have some consciousness.
Now the smart money is on yeah you and I
are one. From this bigger point of view
there's infinite exploration and the
exploration is you. And a lot of the
exploration will be done as the mystical
traditions have said in silence. And
that silence itself is tapping into this
infinite wisdom that everybody is.
Hey everyone, welcome back to the know
thyself podcast. Our guest today is back
for the third time. We love him so much
and I'm excited to dive into this
conversation exploring uh the nature of
reality and its many different aspects.
He is a cognitive psychologist, an
author, a consciousness researcher, and
somebody whose extensive research and
both consciousness and evolutionary game
theory has positioned him uniquely to be
a pioneer in emerging discoveries around
the nature of reality that really shakes
up our intuitions and notions of what it
is in the first place. Donald Hoffman.
>> Thank you, Andre.
>> Good to be back.
>> It's great to be here again, the third
time. Thank you very much for having me
back.
>> Yeah, I think it's going to be great to
set a bit of the framework and set the
stage, not assuming people have t tuned
into the previous two conversations. Uh
let's start off very baseline.
Can you explain to the layman how we
don't see reality as it is?
>> Right. So, most of us assume that what
you see is what you get. I see a car.
That's because there really is a car
there. I see the moon. That's because
the moon really is there. And so forth.
And and we assume those who know
evolutionary theory, for example, might
say, well, and the reason we know that
we see the truth is because we evolved
to be fit. And to be fit, you should see
the truth, right? The the more accurate
your perceptions are, the better you
should see the truth about reality. And
those who think that uh this isn't
reality, if you know, if you don't think
that car is real, if you step in front
of it, you'll find out that it is real.
That it can it can hurt you. So those
are the kinds of intuitions that that we
all have and
it just turns out when you look at
evolutionary theory
carefully. So Darwin didn't have
mathematics. He he gave a a beautiful
theory but there wasn't any mathematics
but John Maynard Smith in the 1970s
mathematized Darwin's ideas and it's a
field called evolutionary game theory.
And so now we can take out Darwin's
ideas and look at mathematical theorems
about what's entailed by his theory. And
you can ask the question, what is the
probability that organisms are shaped by
evolution to see aspects of reality as
it is truthfully?
And
the bottom line is the probability is
zero. That's that's the the bottom line.
When you do the math, the probability is
zero. And the and the reason it's
slightly technical but but not too hard
and and that is there's something called
the fitness functions right they
describe for a given organism if you
take this action and you're in this
state what the consequences the fitness
consequences will be for you and by
fitness you know evolutionary theory of
course means the chances of successfully
reproducing. So that's the the measure
of fitness that we're talking about the
probability of reproducing successfully.
So when you look at these fitness payoff
functions
since they're what's shaping the sensory
systems of the organisms, right? That's
what's shaping evolution in in
evolutionary game theory. These fitness
payoff functions, they depend on the
state of the world, the organism, its
actions, and you get a payoff. Like for
example, just to be very concrete, if if
I'm a human being and I'm standing in
the middle of the 405 freeway at 10:00
in the morning, that's a bad place to be
and my fitness payoff is death, right?
That's that's really a dumb thing to do.
So whereas, you know, so you can see you
have you take an organism, put it in a
place, put it in an action, and then you
get a number, you know, thumbs up or
thumbs down for your for your fitness
payoffs. So these are functions and for
those who know some mathematics they are
just functions and it turns out there's
no constraint on these functions in
evolutionary theory. There's no
constraint that says they only have to
be continuous or they have to be
quadratic or there there's just no
there's no constraint from the theory.
So Darwin's theory doesn't tell us these
are the kinds of functions. So given
that we ask what is the probability? We
can just look at the space of all
possible fitness payoff functions and
ask how many of them will shape
organisms to perceive aspects of
reality.
Very very you can just assess it with
mathematics and it turns out 0%. Zero it
doesn't mean none but it means 0%. So if
you're a betting person um the the good
bet is against seeing the truth.
Now, someone can come back and say,
"Well, I don't like that." I mean, and
most a lot of people do. They come back
and say, "I don't like that." And my
attitude is that's perfectly fine. I
have no skin in the game. I don't care.
I'm just telling you what the current
theory says. The current theory says all
fitness payoff functions are equally
likely. And I say, "Okay, they're all
equally likely. Then the probability
that you see the truth is zero." Now,
someone can come along and say, "Well,
then I'll I'll show you why they're not
all all equally likely." perfectly fine
with me. Go ahead and and do that. But I
haven't seen anybody do that. But that
is the right response to to my Now
here's here's a response that I get a
lot
that is I think um a mistaken response.
The response is, look, Darwin started
his theory with physical organisms
competing in space and time for physical
resources like mates and food and so
forth.
And now you're saying you're using
Darwin's theory, a mathematical version
of it, to prove that the probability
that space and time and organisms and
food and and and so forth um are almost
surely not the nature of reality.
So Hoffen, you should go learn some
logic. You started with the assumption
of space and time and physical objects
and payoffs, you know, you know, fitness
payoffs for for food and so forth. And
now you're saying that that physical
stuff is not the nature of reality.
You've shot yourself in the foot
logically. So go back and learn some
logic. And and this is actually I mean
this is not just informal. I mean there
are philosophers who've published papers
on this where they in prestigious
journals where they make exactly this
kind of argument that I've I've caught
myself in a logical bind. And so so this
raises an important point about science
and it's very elementary.
Scientific theories
start with assumptions.
Like Einstein,
the special theory of relativity, he
started with the assumption that um the
speed of light is the same in all
inertial frames
and that there is no special inertial
frame. The laws of physics are the same
in all inertial frames.
And he said if you grant me those two
assumptions then he could build actually
um relativistic spacetime with all the
the changing clocks and and meter stick
lengths and the whole bit came from
those assumptions
and
but he didn't didn't explain the
assumptions he assumed those assumptions
and actually toward the end of his life
Einstein said I still don't know what
light is I've spent my life thinking
about light and working on light and and
I don't know so he doesn't know why the
speed of light is the same in all
inertial frames or why all inertial
frames have the same laws of physics.
But those are his assumptions. And this
is true of any scientific theory.
>> And when you say that, by the way, you
just mean the speed limit on the
universe essentially,
>> right? This that yeah, nothing can go
faster than the speed of light.
>> Mhm.
>> So,
>> and he didn't want to spend most of his
life figuring out why, but just kind of
went with that assumption.
>> Well, I think Einstein wondered a lot
about why.
>> Yeah. But like but he couldn't answer
the question if you assume it then you
get the structure of what we call
manowski space coming coming out of it.
>> Um and you and of course I think you can
with any scientific theory you can say
I'll give you a new set of assumptions
that are deeper and from my new set of
assumptions I'll explain your previous
assumptions. But but here's the key
point.
No scientific theory
can ever be a theory of everything.
Period.
Anybody who doesn't have a wink and a
nod when they talk about their theory of
everything is missing the point. I think
a lot of brilliant physicists who talk
about a theory of everything know that
they're not talking about a theory of
everything. But you they really just
mean the unification of you know certain
the theories that that are not unified
now.
But there are a lot of people who think
that we could get a theory of
everything. And I'm saying no. Never.
Even if we worked for a billion years
and had a billion Einstein's working for
a billion years, we would never have the
theory of everything. We we'd get 0% of
reality. And the reason is every theory
starts with assumptions and it doesn't
explain its assumptions. It assumes
them. And therefore, every theory
has two properties. If it's if it's a
good theory, it has a scope of
explanation. So there is a scope of
things that it can explain.
By the way, most theories don't. Mo most
theories, and you I get them in emails a
lot. Most theories have no scope
whatsoever. There there's nothing there.
But a good theory has a scope, but it's
a it's a limited scope. It's not
everything. It's not a theory of
everything. And then so they have a
scope and they can tell you if it's a
good theory, they'll give you
mathematics to explore that scope.
But if it's a great theory, not just a
good theory, but a great theory, it will
give you the tools to figure out the
limits of explanation that were entailed
by the very assumptions that started the
theory. Because a theory must start with
assumptions, it has limited scope. The
only question is does the theory itself
give you the tools? Is it great theory
to give you the tools to find that
necessary limit or not? And what I'm
saying is Darwin's theory with John
Maynard Smith's mathematics of
evolutionary game theory is a great
theory. We knew upfront that it couldn't
be the final theory of everything. And
it turns out to have the tools to say
that its very foundational assumptions
of course are not the final truth. But
we knew that that's true for any
scientific theory. You give me a
scientific theory, tell me its
assumptions, and I will tell you
something that's not the final truth.
Those assumptions, the So,
a theory that gives you assumptions that
let you come back and tell you that
those assumptions aren't the final word
on truth is a great theory. And those
are the theories that we look for. So,
so it's for those who have said that I'm
shooting myself in my in the foot, they
completely misunderstand the foundations
of science itself and the scientific
enterprise.
It's not the the false interpretation is
science is the crawling towards the
ultimate truth and we're going to get
there. Maybe who knows, maybe this
century we'll get there. That's just
false. The right approach or I'll put it
this way a deeper approach to
understanding science is to note that
every scientific theory starts with its
own assumptions and therefore
it has limited scope of explanation and
if it's a great theory it will use its
own assumptions to show the limits of
those assumptions and to show that they
can't be the final but most theories
aren't that good. I mean Einstein's
theory it's Einstein's theory I must say
together with quantum mechanics. So
quantum field theory together with um
which brings together quantum mechanics
and and Einstein theory and and also
general relativity together that package
tells us that spaceime cannot be
fundamental. Um so that's in the physics
side and in Darwin's theory is Darwin's
theory by itself agrees that physical
objects in spaceime can't be
fundamental. So here we have quantum
field theory
and
evolutionary theory telling us that
spacetime and its objects are not
fundamental. Now
we already knew that none of our
assumptions are fundamental. It's just
great to have the these theories being
so powerful that they're telling us that
the that these assumptions are not
fundamental. So that's the that's the
fundamental orientation that people need
to have about this thing. It it's not
about shooting yourself in the foot. No
theory has the final assumptions. Some
theories are so deep that their
assumptions tell you that the
assumptions aren't true. They're not the
final word. But most theories aren't
that good. We're going to keep diving
into all of that. uh but to to keep
making our way through this in a
digestible manner. I'm curious because
when you speak to how
the likelihood that evolution has shaped
sensory systems to you know see
objective reality is effectively zero
and you know perception is reality in so
many ways as as a human beings. We kind
of share generally a a similar sense um
through our sense perceptions and sense
organs, this experience of life. And it
seems like we see reality as it is
because it's ubiquitous within our
experience. It's all we've known. And
yet, I think what's helpful in seeing
and breaking down this notion of it
being connected to what reality actually
is seeing the variance in how uh
perception occurs within all all life.
And so I'm curious what comes to mind
when you think about all the different
uh life life forms and and uh animals
and their sense organs and how they
perceive reality. Uh where if you put
them side by side to us, our experience
of life is completely different and yet
we both feel like it's the way reality
is to us because it is for us. Well,
that that's a a great question and
there's a lot to say on that, but one
thing I'll I'll start with is is to
point out that I actually don't know
what your perceptions are like,
>> right?
>> I can assume
>> assume that, you know, I we I pick up
this cup and I say, "Yeah, it's sort of
a a cup has got some bins in it and it's
got some tea in it." And you would you
would agree, but I have no idea what
your experience is. I assume that it's
very much like mine and Part of this is
because we we learn to talk by something
called ostensive definition. So if
you're a child, you know, and and your
mom or your dad is there and you're like
18 months old and and it's time for you
to learn some words and there's a rabbit
on the floor and uh mom or dad points
and says rabbit and if the child's at
the right age, they get it. You only
have to point once or twice and say
rabbit. And but if the child right if
you did it when they were 6 months old
it doesn't work. It doesn't work. And if
you do it with a a rat it doesn't work.
If you take a rat and point to a rabbit
and say rabbit it doesn't work. It why
does it work with a child? Well, the
child already had
its own experience and
conceptualization, so to speak,
organization of it as as a rabbit. And
and so all you do as a parent is you
name, you give the words for the
experience that the child already has.
You're not giving the experiences. The
child's experience is whatever it is as
for and and you don't know how how can
you ever know for for all I know your
world could be utterly different in
conscious experiences
>> now now you of course you have some
empirical evidence for this
>> but but it is also just important to
highlight that even within the spectrum
of human experience there is variance
that we do know of and there is also a
lot of variance that we don't know of
that we just assume that is the same
>> that's right so in color. So, we assume
I I talk about the the green plants here
and and you know, a little bit of red in
the carpet and so forth. Um, and I
assume that your experience of red and
green and so forth is very very similar
to mine. But there are women called
tetrafms who have four color photo
receptors instead of three. Most of us
have just um short, medium, and long
wavelength photo receptors. And these
women have four instead of just three.
And they're called tetrofilms. and they
in in I I'm actually friends with
someone who's done research on this,
Kimberly Jameson and others who have
done research on this and they they can
do genetic tests and they find these
women that have um you know the gene for
being tetrahilms and put them in
psychophysical experiments where you
test their color discriminations and
they're finer than ours. They actually
have different color boundaries and
finer discriminations. They can see, you
know, maybe an order of magnitude more
colors than than we can. So we we
already have empirical evidence. Again,
we don't we don't know what it's like to
be a tetra. I don't know what it's like.
I mean, no guy could ever know. And most
women could could never know. Um
but even if you're a tri chromat
experience, like I assume, and I'm I'm
not saying it's a bad assumption. I'm
not I if I had to bet I'd say there's no
reason for me to to disbelieve. But I'm
just I just want to point out that it's
a belief. It's not a
proven fact. It's a belief that your
perceptions are similar to mine. Here
here's here's a fun technological thing
that someone could do.
I think that you we could write a
multi-person
AI
firstperson game
where people around the world could be,
you know, put on a headset, be immersed
in a game that they're all playing
internationally, but each headset is
actually a very, very different looking
game, but there's a translation. So
maybe I'm playing tennis in this one and
you're playing bad mitten in that one
and someone else is is is playing uh you
know Grand Theft Auto over there and and
we're all playing together. I even
though you're playing Grand Theft Auto,
I think you're playing tennis with me
and and and I think that you could
actually coordinate that such that I'm
playing and we all we're all
interacting, but then when you change
headsets, you go, "Holy smoke, you were
playing a completely different game than
I thought you were playing." And and I
think that that would be fun to do to
really shake people up and show that
that you the assumption. Now, now again,
I'm not claiming that we're not seeing
the same game,
>> but I'm saying it would be fun to shake
up the assumption that we are by putting
together a multiplayer VR situation
where as you change you like a dozen
different headsets and every one of them
is a different world and you're doing
something entirely different in that
world and yet they're all coordinated.
Mhm.
>> So, so that I think that's eminently
possible and that would really go a long
way to shaking people up. Um, and again,
for all I know, your experiences are
very much like mine.
>> Yeah. And but it is interesting how we
are really only always speaking in
approximations and language is always
going to be futile in it. It helps us
kind of speak about reality in a sort of
agreed upon shared sense that is a lie
fundamentally but like we can just kind
of approximate what we perceive on the
less than 1% available to us on the
electromagnetic spectrum.
>> Yes. Um, but we know that before we even
get into different animals and what
their experience is like that depending
on the state of consciousness that we're
in and we could
very subtly tweak our biochemistry,
exogenously, endogenously,
um, psychedelics, many different things.
and the uh the experience of reality
changes so drastically by very minor
changes. Uh so it's just yeah
fascinating little DMT and you're in a
different world
>> completely different world and and then
for a lot of people then shakes up very
much the assumption that what I'm seeing
is is reality. I haven't done it.
>> Yeah. But lots of people contact me and
say, "I have done it and I I like your
theory because when I go on DMT, it it
it says you're and so I I didn't come up
with a theory because of DMT, but I get
people with DMT saying this really
works. I've seen a lot of comments on
previous episodes of both the ones we've
done and others where people who have
explored psychedelics or DMP for example
have really resonated because there is
this fundamental uh I guess effect of
your work which is shaking up our notion
of preconceived notions of reality and
uh and so yeah let's keep going. So what
yeah what are some other examples of
life that has different access to
different parts of the electromagnetic
spectrum with their own sense organs
that you find interesting?
>> Right. So uh some birds can see the
polarization of light and they use it to
navigate. I can't see the polarization
of light. I I don't know what it would
be like to experience the polarization
of light. You can get a little sense of
it if you wear sunglasses, right? and
and you know things look darker when I
look over there and a little bit
brighter when I look over there. So you
can get some sense of it but but we're
not actually built with polarization. Um
there are
all sorts of um well there are animals
that see frequencies of light that we
can't see ultraviolet or infrared. Um,
it's it's truly stunning the the the
range of
other experiences. There are some that
can experience electric fields. So, they
actually have electro receptors and they
can and they actually use it in like I
guess in in water, sharks and so forth.
I'm not not sure about sharks, but but
certain animals can use electric fields
to detect prey and and capture prey. And
again, I have no idea what it would be
like to have an electric field around me
and using that to to detect prey. There
there are some wonderful books out there
um about just how different the animal
senses are. So, it's easy to find find
books.
>> Mhm. All right. So, reality is not the
way that we perceive it. I think we can
all agree upon that. And uh so then walk
us through a little bit closer now to
your understanding of sort of spaceime
being a headset. How do you bridge us
into the into the deeper implications of
your work exploring consciousness? And
um yeah, when you say spacetime is like
a headset that we're wearing,
>> right? Just like when you're playing
Grand Theft Auto, it seems like this
reality and if you have a VR headset
that you're playing, it seems like the
the reality that you're immersed in
because you're so plugged into it and
it's so enchanting in your experience of
it,
>> right?
>> Um but uh if real if perception is not
objective reality, then what is
perception?
>> Right? So we can go back to evolutionary
theory on this. So if I'm saying
Darwin's theory entails not that we see
objective reality, but it's shaping us
to be fit. What what does that mean? I
mean, most of us think, well, the only
way you could be fit is to see reality.
And these virtual reality games give a
different idea about that. If you're
playing Grand Theft Auto VR, then what
you're really interacting with in in
this situation are millions of diodes
and resistors and voltages and some
supercomputer somewhere. And it in
principle, you could play the game by
toggling millions of voltages per second
in exactly the right sequence. You'd
have to be really really good, but it
would be millions of voltages per
second. It have to be exactly the right
sequence. If we ever anybody who's who's
programmed, you get one bit wrong and
the whole thing falls apart. So, so you
could do that, but you would lose if you
were tried to even if you wrote the
program, you would lose if you were
trying to toggle all those bits one by
one against someone who had just a VR
headset and had a steering wheel,
virtual steering wheel and was trying to
play the game that way. and that so the
person with the headset with the VR
headset is going to be more fit more
likely to win at playing the game of
Grand Theft Auto than the person who
sees the reality and can toggle the
bits. And so that's the notion of
fitness that comes out of Darwin. Um you
don't see the truth
and I think the reason is because it's
infinitely complicated.
>> Reality whatever it is is infinitely
complicated. There's no way period to
understand it in a in a so it's just off
the table.
>> It would defeat the purpose of having an
experience that allows us to effectively
navigate anything.
>> That's right. So all we can all we So
reality is what it is and it's it's
infinitely complicated. We have a little
trivial three-dimensional space,
one-dimensional time headset that takes
this infinity of complexity and puts it
down into what looks to us like a
complicated world, but it's 0% of the
complexity of reality. 0%.
And and and that's what Darwin's theory
is telling us is this is a headset that
is there to keep you alive in this
particular game.
The game of
being a human being reproducing,
having a job, whatever. In that game,
this is the headset you need to to to
play that game. If you're an elephant,
it's a different game. If you're a worm,
it's a different different headset. But
spacetime then
is not the final ground of being.
It's a trivial headset. It's a trivial
framework compared to what's available.
And I should say that, you know, I've
used Darwin on this, but someone might
say, well, look, you know, Darwin's not
a physicist. He's not an expert in
spacetime. I mean, we should go to those
people, the experts. And those experts
are so-called high energy theoretical
physicists. That's the right group of
scientists. What do they say? Do they
come along and say, "No, Darwin was
wrong. Space time is fundamental and get
used to it. Darwin was just wrong." No,
they don't say that at all. They they
say, and you know, I'm saying like Nemo
Connie Jamemed um David Gross and others
um say spacetime is doomed.
By that they mean it's not fundamental.
It it falls apart
um at 10us 33 cm 10 theus 43 seconds at
what's called the plank scale. It ceases
to have any operational meaning. And so
physicists
again high energy theoretical
physicists. So when I say physicists I'm
short for high energy theoretical
physicists in this context. So these
physicists are saying that that
spacetime is not fundamental and we have
to look for a deeper mathematical
framework entirely outside of spaceime
and that's not just a distant wish.
They're doing it now. The European
Research Council has a 10 million euro
um enterprise funding of roughly you
know dozens or even a hundred I think um
physicists and mathematicians who are
finding what they call positive
geometries outside of spaceime. It's
it's it's really quite exciting. They're
finding these
>> like the amplitude or is that
>> Yeah, the amplitude is one of them. The
cosmological polytope um associ
and and and other other structures. So
they're they're they're finding these
like almost like these monoliths outside
of space time. These these the these big
structures, complicated geometric
structures, and they they allow you to
actually predict correctly the
probabilities of interactions. The this
called scattering amplitudes for
interactions of particles in spaceime.
So so they know they're on to something
and the math is much easier. what would
take millions of terms to compute within
spacetime through like
some gluons and and um photons and
whatever um and quarks interacting they
can do um much much more simply outside
of space time. Is it a rudimentary
understanding to say like you wouldn't
expect to go into a vacant field where
no one has been and there's no form of
intelligence and see a Taj Mahal
structure there for example that would
denote that there is some sort of there
was a intelligence weaving some sort of
structure or a builder an architect to
some degree when you look at these
cosmological polytopes that you discover
in the mathematical sphere like
>> what Is that what question does that
raise about I guess the meaning or why
they're there?
>> Well, it raises all sorts of questions
like like we didn't know what to expect.
You know, we're we're taking our first
little peaks outside of space time just
in the last say 15 20 years, right?
We're we're you know we realized I think
they knew before that that spacetime
wasn't fundamental. But what do you do?
How do you go outside of spaceime?
what's your your research agenda to do
that? How do you how do you do that? And
so it's it's taken some very very clever
researchers to to to sort of say, well,
how are we going to go out? I mean, I
can't even see outside spacetime. So,
it's going to be with mathematics and
and intuition and and logic that we're
going to have to try to go outside of
spaceime. And so what they're finding so
they are surprised they're finding these
geometric structures and I and the
volumes
are coding probabilities of particle
interactions and the the structure of
the vertices and and and so forth. The
the edges is is
coding for things like what the unitary
evolutions and so forth and and so it's
really it's really
It's a bit surprising. They're not
seeing what they're not showing is the
dynamics, right? You might say, "Well, I
expect to go outside of spaceime and see
a something moving." Although it's hard
to know what what it means to be moving
outside of spaceime, right? I mean,
moving in spaceime means over time
something changes space position. So, so
you want some kind of dynamics, but not
a dynamics inside spaceime.
So, I think that I mean
They're brilliant. They're finding what
they what they can find. Um,
but it's not a dynamical system. It's a
it's a these objects that encode the
dynamics that we can see inside space
time. So, it's connected to dynamics we
see inside spaceime. But it what they
what I haven't seen them doing
is saying, I'm going to posit this
dynamical system outside of spaceime and
then show how it projects to the
dynamics we see inside spaceime. Um, so
it's it's it's more it's more of the of
the line of we step outside spacetime.
What can we find outside in terms of
geometries that will predict what we see
inside spacetime? You have to go outside
of spaceime. Now it's the game is not
complete inside spacetime. You have to
step outside spaceime. So that's going
to be really critical for theories of
consciousness too.
>> What's the oneliner or twoliner for
people like uh when you say spacetime,
what are you what are you speaking to
directly? What is spacetime?
>> Under Newton Newtonian physics, space
was three-dimensional and uklidian and
time was the same in all places in
space. So there was one big clock and
everybody had the same clock and
space itself was nice and uklidium.
Einstein
in the special theory and general theory
effectively said it was it was actually
Einstein's teacher who put this together
manowski permanency but based on
Einstein's work that space and time
together form a single mathematical
object that Menowski we now call
manowski space but and we call it
spacetime
and in which you can trade off a little
bit of space for a little bit of time.
So, as opposed to having a single clock
that's true for all observers,
>> there are different clocks for different
observers depending on how fast you move
and
and different lengths of rulers
depending on how how fast you move. So,
so it's it's it's not the nice clean
neat space that we had with Newton. This
is really much more interesting where
space and time trade off. There's no
universal clock. your clock if if if
you're moving I mean the fact that I
just moved like this with respect to you
means my clock moved differently than
yours during that time we have we had
different clocks and also links were
different for us you see this as an
example in the movie like interstellar
where he goes on a space mission and
>> depending on where he goes obviously
time relative to the human clock on
earth is different and he comes back in
like 30 plus years or whatever has
elapsed in a earthly time um but it
might have And I don't I forgot what it
was, maybe like a certain amount of 6
months or a year or something in terms
of how far where he went. That that's
right. So if if
if you're moving with respect to me, I'm
I'm you know, I'm sitting here. I'm
thinking of myself as being still and
you're moving past me at at a uniform
speed. If if you're at a uniform speed
with respect to me, you're not
accelerating, then I will see your clock
as going slower. And if you as you
approach the speed of light, if you're
going near the speed of light, I will
see your clock very very close to not
moving at all. And if you are going the
speed of light, I will see your clock
has stopped. But similarly, if if if I'm
not accelerating with respect to you.
So, and you're looking at me, you're
going to see my clock going slower.
You're going to think your clock is
going just fine. You're going to see my
So, it Now, if you accelerate, that's
different. Acceleration is not relative.
It's it's absolute. So there so so that
that gets more complicated. Wouldn't it
be true then somebody at the core of the
earth or maybe you just say like at sea
level would be traveling time would be
moving faster for them than somebody
like at at the top of a Mount Everest or
something.
>> That is that that is true. The the the
clock depends on the gravitational
field.
>> Mhm. um where you are, but it's because
>> time moves slower in the mountains,
>> right? But but because you're having
you're accelerating less. So So it has
to do with the acceleration.
>> It's all comparative. Yeah,
>> that's right.
>> Um okay. Yeah, we can there's so many
sidebars here, but let's just kind of
get back to the notion that
our perception is obviously not
objective reality. And to go further
down the rabbit hole of psychosis. Um or
I joke but really to what it means to be
saying is to to see and understand
experience reality closer to objective
the objective sense. Um things are not
rendered when they are not perceived.
>> Right. So for people that for when
that's a if that's a foreign notion to
people, can you explain what that means
both in the mathematical sense and yeah
the philos philosophical sense I guess.
>> Yeah, that's a really an important point
and and and that is that
we assume that the moon is there even if
you don't look. Of course it's there.
And that car on the freeway is there
even if you don't look. And if you don't
believe it, don't look away. And when it
hits you, you'll know that it was real.
Right? So people will say you it it it
exists whether or not you look and and
I'm saying that the car that you
perceive
is very much like if you have a VR
headset on you're playing Grand Theft
Auto and you're looking around and and
you look down, you see your steering
wheel. So there's a steering wheel when
you look because you're rendering it.
But if I look off to the side now, since
I'm not seeing the steering wheel,
there's there is no steering wheel.
There's no steering wheel anywhere at
all. that that steering wheel is gone
>> except for potentially somebody else's
experience who's rendering it.
>> Yeah. But they'll have their own
experience, right? So, but but but if
you look inside the supercomput, there's
no wheel in there. There's just digital
bits and and circuits and software. So,
the I render the car, I render the
steering wheel when I look and I garbage
collect it. I get rid of it when when I
look away. Someone else may look but but
their experience of a steering wheel is
not my experience of a steering wheel.
It's their experience. Mine mine is
gone. There is no in in the real
supercomput there is no steering wheel
anywhere. There's just bits. So that's
what I'm claiming is true of all of the
world that we see around us. You render
the moon when you look and there is no
moon when you don't look. I render my
foot when I look and there is no foot
when I don't look. When you say there is
no would you apply that to people
because when you say there's no Don when
I don't render him yet in your
experience Don is certainly there and in
somebody else's experience you're
certainly there. That gets that's a very
deep question because now it gets to the
question of what am I really and what
are you really right? So if if you
wanted to say no, Don is really just a
160lb piece of human flesh and blood and
so forth and that's all there is to
Donna. I would say um
that's within the space-time framework
and we know that the space-time
framework is not fundamental.
No object in spaceime is fundamental and
that includes your body or my body.
Whatever you are,
you are not an object in spacetime.
To the contrary, spacetime and
everything inside spaceime is a creation
of yours on the fly. So, I'm turning the
whole ontology around. Most of us assume
that we are little 100 to 200 300lb
objects inside a vast
space-time universe. I'm saying that's
false.
That vast space-time universe is a tiny
headset that you're using that you'll
discard and it's just one of countless
headsets that you whatever you are can
use. So,
so when you ask, you know, is Dawn
really there? Well, in this VR game of
space and time, this pretty trivial
headset, Hoffman's body is rendered when
you see it or when I see it. And I don't
know that what you see is what I see at
all. We use the same words because we
learned them by ostensive definition
from our mothers and our mothers use the
same words in the same context.
Um, and I'm not saying they're not the
same.
They may be, but we don't know. But but
whatever I am is not an object in
spacetime. Spacetime is a trivial
trivial
framework for us to experience a
projection of who we are.
Hey guys, if you're looking to add a
simple but powerful health tool to your
daily or weekly routine, I recommend
checking out Bond Charg's red light
devices. I usually use mine during my
morning meditation and it's helped with
everything from energy and mood to skin
health and sleep. Red light therapy is
backed by thousands of studies and it's
a great way to get healthy light
exposure without messing up your
circadian rhythm. Boncharge stands out
because their devices have the lowest
EMF levels. There's no flicker and they
have both near infrared and red light in
one lightweight device. They ship
worldwide and also have an array of
other sciencebacked wellness products
worth exploring. If you want to try it
out, you can go to
bondcharge.com/nolithself
and use code know for 15% off. That's b
a r ge.com/nolithself.
All bond charge products are HSA and FSA
eligible, giving you taxfree savings of
up to 40%. I hope you enjoy. Back to the
show.
So when you say
the very well-known phrase or question
of if a tree falls in the forest and no
one's around to perceive it, does it
still make a sound? I suppose it begs
the question of what do you what do you
mean make a sound? Because that is a
subjective experience to an observer and
if there is no such observer then it
would not. Is that right?
>> Right. That's what what I'm is saying is
that and this gets to yeah so yes it
gets to a very deep point though and
that is that what do we mean by making
an observation
and this has been a big problem in
science so in Newton
it was assumed that the observer just
sees reality as it is and you could
ignore the observer because the observer
didn't affect what was being observed so
Newton didn't really need a theory of
the observer you just see the truth
With Einstein, there's a notion of an
observer, but it's mostly just uh
different observers are different clocks
and coordinate systems.
And there's no really deep theory of the
observer beyond the clocks. In quantum
theory,
now
you're forced to consider what you mean
by an observer because quantum theory
says that when you don't observe a
system,
it evolves according to what's called
the Schroinger equation. That's a
unitary evolution.
But when you observe a system
then empirical experiments you know tell
us that
what happens is not a unitary evolution.
you get a single answer like for
electron or a photon maybe having some
kind of quantum evolution under the
Schroinger equation and but when you
then and and the superp position of all
these different paths it could be taking
but when you make a measurement you get
a dot on the screen here and so that's
where the electron or the photon landed
and so you get a single answer and
that's not a unitary process and and So
that raises a a deep deep question about
what do we mean by an observer and and
quantum mechanics really can't avoid it.
The problem is that if if you want to
say well it's an observer is just any
physical measuring device and many
quantum theorists have said that it's
just a physical measuring device that
takes the superp position and gives you
a single well no
shortinger evolution described physical
device can do that.
A device that does that does not satisfy
the shortinger equation.
So
we have a problem. If the universe
behaves one way under the Schroinger
equation when you don't when you don't
observe,
you can't just call in a measuring
device and say, "Well, it it does it."
What is your theory of the measuring
device? Is it a is it a quantum theory?
Then give me your unitary operator. A
unitary operator can't give you a single
output. So what are we talking about
here? you can't be done. They'll say,
well, you can do it with what they call
decoherence. Well, we can um
the bottom line is decoherence doesn't
solve the problem. Decoherence gets rid
of the complex numbers, the complex
amplitudes and it can give you a real
set of probabilities. So, you can a set
of outcomes with real probabilities, but
it doesn't it doesn't give you a single
outcome. So decoherence doesn't solve
the problem either. It it gives you um a
mix what we call a mixed state
for probabilities, real probabilities,
not complex amplitudes, real
probabilities of of outcomes. But that's
not what happens in an experiment. We
get a single answer. So if decoar is
going to work, I want you to give me a
single answer, not a probability on
answers. So that's so that and Frank
Wilchek who a Nobel Prize winner for his
work in in quantum chromodynamics I
think points this out that we you know
quantum mechanics needs a theory of the
observer um that that's that's really an
open nasty problem. So right now science
does not have
a universally nothing close to a
universally agreed on theory of the
observer. this it's considered one of
the big open problems by quant you know
by Nobel prize winners in in in quantum
physics to to solve that problem. So
what is an observer
right now? Science doesn't have an
answer. It does not have an answer.
How do you explain why the physicalist
notion and paradigm of consciousness
cannot explain a single qualia or
experience like the reason for that? Um
and
and then yeah we'll just set the stage a
bit more of how consciousness comes into
all this
>> right so we have been talking about
conscious experiences and most of my my
colleagues in cognitive neuroscience who
are studying consciousness are
physicists
um and they're brilliant. They're good
friends and colleagues and they're
brilliant and they're assuming that
space and time are fundamental
and that certain physical systems in
spaceime that have certain properties
will give rise to conscious experiences.
So, so again, it's a space-time
framework. Presumably at the big bang
there were no conscious experiences. we,
you know, space and time and physical
objects just didn't have the right kind
of causal or functional properties to
generate or instantiate consciousness.
But after billions of years of
evolution, you know, you start getting
the right kinds of causal structures or
functional structures and and and so so
they're they're you know, again, these
are friends and colleagues. They're
they're brilliant and they have you know
for example integrated information
theory that there are certain causal
structures that are um identical to
certain conscious experiences
um or global workspace theory again
certain functional properties uh there
there's you know orchestrated collapse
of quantum states of microtubules for
Ben rose and hammeroff and there's
there's many um I'm just mentioning a
few
and
But the theme behind all of them is
there is a physical substrate in space
and time that's necessary.
And if that substrate has the right
properties,
the right causal and functional
properties generally then it will give
rise to life and and then if it has even
more precise properties that living
thing will then give rise to
consciousness. So from the mech
mechanistic or deterministic lens that
since from the origin of the big bang to
the development of sense organs in
neurology that enough unconscious
complexity would develop in a human
brain for example that would then give
rise to a certain point of an experience
of itself aka consciousness awareness.
And
>> but yet the the smell of a flower or the
taste of a chocolate or mint
that has yet to be and probably never
will be especially through your
understanding be explained through the
physicalist notion like the experience
of something
right. So so yes so some physicists will
say that that physical systems with
right properties will give rise to
conscious experiences. Others like Dan
Dennett would say they give rise to the
illusion of of conscious experiences. Uh
as a hard-nosed scientist
uh I want explanations of specific
conscious experiences. Right? So no one
has put a gun to my friends and
colleagues heads to say you must come up
with a physicalist framework and explain
the taste of mint in that framework.
known that they've chosen to do that and
they they're they're making claims that
there are causal structures that are
identical to the taste of men. For
example, integrated information theory
says there's a matrix. You can actually
write down a marov matrix. It's a it's a
square array of numbers like it could be
10 rows and 10 columns. So it has a 100
numbers in it and each row is a
probability measure and that's going to
give you your causal structure. So no
nonsense. there's this this mathematical
model there. And that is, you know, if
it's the right causal structure, it will
be the taste of mint or the smell of
garlic or whatever it might be. So,
I didn't tell them to do that. I didn't
say they had to do that. No one told
them that. They've chosen to do that.
So, as a scientist, I say, "Okay, well,
so you're proposing that theory. So,
great. Give me one." There's literally
trillions of experiences that humans can
have. Trillions.
Should be like shooting fish in a
barrel. Pick one. Pick any experience
that you want to and give me your
matrix. Tell me, you know, if it's, you
know, is it a,000 by,000? Is it 1253 by
1253?
What's the principal reason for why it
has to have that number of rows and
columns? And then if it's like a,000
by,000. Well, there's a million numbers.
1,000 times 1,000 is a million. So
there's a million numbers. And as a
scientist, you need to tell me why each
number is exactly each one of those
million numbers is exactly the value it
is. and why that's necessary for this to
be the causal structure of mint.
Again, I didn't tell you to do this. No
one put a gun to your head. You're
offering this theory and I'm just being
a hard no scientist and saying, "Okay,
that's your theory. Give me one. Give me
a particular case." And I do this at
conferences all the time. I my my
buddies are up there and they know I'm
going to do it. And the answer in every
case is they can't give one. There's
trillions of experiences and zero have
been explained. Zero. And it's not
because these people are dumb. They are
brilliant. They are some of them are
geniuses.
You can't construct conscious
experiences from unconscious
ingredients. Can't be done. Just that
simple. And so that's 99%
of the research in the cognitive
neuroscience of consciousness is of this
type. And here's here's why
they do it.
There are incredible neural coralates of
conscious experiences. Anybody who
studied in this area knows hundreds of
there's hundreds of well-known neural
coralates of conscious experiences.
I've studied them myself. It's it's a
worthwhile area of study. I've been a
participant in fMRI and EEG experiments
and and and so forth. I'm not against
it. I'm I'm for it. I'm a co-author on
some. It's it's good stuff. It's good to
find coralates, neural coralates of
conscious experiences. And we even find
neural coralates where we can predict
from your brain activity several seconds
before you can tell me what you're going
to experience or or think or or do. So I
can actually beat you to the punch. So
most people say that hands
click case closed. Case closed. I mean,
if I can read your neural activity ahead
of time and and know what you are going
to do before you can tell me what you're
going to do, clearly your brain caused
it. Not at all. Absolutely not.
Correlation, even prior, you know, prior
activity doesn't entail causation. It
just doesn't. Roosters
crow near sunrise
but and they're highly correlated and
that doesn't mean that the rooster crows
cause sunrise
train station. You see a bunch of 100
people gather at a at a particular train
station and all of a sudden a train
arrives. So just by looking at the
people, oh there's lots of people
gathering. I can predict, you know, 10
minutes ahead of time there's going to
be a train coming. Right. Is it is the
train come because all the people are
there? No. There's something deeper that
you can't see. There's a schedule that's
coordinating both the activity of the
people and the activity of the train.
That's the deeper thing that's going on
here. So, and that's what I'm proposing
is yeah, there are these correlations
and sure brain activity in many cases um
precedes um the experience or or
precedes the action or even your
knowledge of what you're going to do and
you can predict it from the brain. That
absolutely in no way entails that brain
activity
even exists when it's not perceived.
It doesn't. So, and I'm saying think
about again the the train schedule. It's
just this is something that you didn't
see. It's something there's people and
there's the train. What you're not
seeing is this train schedule which is
different. It's it's deeper. I'm saying
there's something outside of spaceime
that's if we're going to talk about
causes and effects. I'm not even sure
>> Mhm. outside of spaceime that we we
should do that. But if if if we're going
to talk about causes and effects, it
would be outside of spaceime that we'd
look for those causes.
>> So let's go a bit more into your
modeling of conscious observers and
marov chains. What what are those? How
would you explain that to the layman?
>> Right. So
and I should put that in in a context.
Yeah. Right. So
>> why that way? Why the why go after it
this way?
Because the idea that consciousness is
fundamental is prior to space and time
um is not new, right? You know,
spiritual traditions um and idealist
philosophies and and so forth have um in
some cases said this for thousands of
years. And it was those kinds of
traditions that um were sort of against
science. likely the church imprisoned
Galileo for heresy for dis disregarding
certain spiritual
doctrines that they had um and on you
know he had to recant some of his
science um and so there's this long
history between science and and and
spiritual views that take consciousness
as fundamental and and in from the
science point of view we freed ourselves
from the
arrogant dogmatism of many of those
traditions.
And we we said, "Let's do our own
experiments. Forget authority. We don't
care about authority. We want to do
experiments,
write down mathematical descriptions of
what we see, and build our theories."
And it works. Authority doesn't work. If
you look at all the technologies that we
have around here, you know, cameras,
watches, cell phones,
how many of those were invented by
spiritual traditions? Zero.
How many were in invented by physicalist
science? All of them. So based on what
works, you would say spirituality,
there's no beef there. It hasn't
produced anything. And the spac-time
view has produced
science and all the technology. The the
church argued that their authority was
based on lots of miracles that then they
should be taken seriously because of all
the miracles. Um
today all the miracles are from science.
I can talk to someone on the other side
of the world right now by by phone. To
someone in 1850 that would have been
indistinguishable from a miracle. and
it's science. So, so when I say
consciousness is fundamental, it's in
this big context that that we have to
look at that that was said for a long
long time. Science was the middle finger
to that. Basically, it was saying, "No,
we're going to do something hard-nosed
here. We're going to do experiments in
space and time with physical stuff." And
look at now we're the ones that have the
miracles on our side. You know, the if
you want authority, we have the
miracles, not you.
But now I'm saying it's time for us to
step back and look at this whole thing.
I'm I'm not going back to the authority.
I don't care less about authority.
Couldn't care less. I think it's it was
misused against Galileo and I have no
interest in it. But the idea that
spacetime isn't fundamental and that
somehow consciousness might be
fundamental, I think is worth pursuing.
But we have to say from the get-go
that idea has given us absolutely no
technology and no precise mathematics
>> which if it then somehow through making
this rigorous does bear fruit and
technology will open up a whole new era
which we can get into but you know I
want to I want to I want to make our way
through the Markoff chains and
>> right so so that's now the Markoff
chains come up because the here's here's
the issue.
We need our first theory of
consciousness, qua consciousness outside
of spacetime. That first theory that's
mathematically precise and can make
predictions about things in spaceime. So
there have been quasi theories you might
call them.
But no theories that say I start with
consciousness with this mathematical
model outside of spaceime show you
exactly how it projects into spaceime
and make predictions that are testable
inside spacetime. There's nothing on the
table and if you and and so you know I
want to really be clear about this.
I was hard-nosed about the my physicist
colleagues and friends saying how many
conscious experiences you can explain
zero.
Okay. And we're clear. You can explain
zero. And you and you've been at this
for decades now. Now let's turn it
around for the spiritual traditions.
You've been at it for millennia. Not
just decades. You've been at it for
millennia. How much how many of your
theories can now explain manowski space
and curved space time Einstein and and
give us the standard model part? Zero.
There's nothing on the board. So both
sides have nothing literally nothing on
the board in terms of starting with
physics and and booting up
consciousness. There's nothing on the
board. Starting with consciousness and
booting up physics, there's nothing on
the board. So that that's the state of
play. So what I'm trying to do now is to
put something on the board. And
I'm convinced that the physicists can't
do it because not because I'm a
cognitive scientist and they don't like
physics. It's because the high energy
theoretical physicists tell us spacetime
is doomed. Okay, they're the expert and
I knew it anyway because
no theory is the final word. Spacetime
can't be the final word. That's just an
assumption.
And my theory is also going to have its
own limits, but at least they'll be
broader than the space-time limits. So
I'm proposing that we can model
consciousness with these things called
markup chains. And I'll explain just
intuitively what what that means. Very
very simple.
I'll use a traffic light like I do in my
little paper. Suppose you're sitting in
your car waiting at a traffic light and
you're looking, you know, because you
have to pay attention. It's red, of
course.
And you know that you so that's your
experience. I'm seeing red and a little
bit it turns green and then if you if
you stay if you're stupid to stay there
for a while it'll turn yellow and it'll
turn red. So you you get with the
traffic light you can see there's three
experiences. You can have red, green,
and yellow. And there's also a sequence
that you'll see if I'm look if I see red
now then um
if I can say what's what's what what
will I see next right what so the next
thing I'll see is green and then if I
see green now the next thing I'll see is
yellow so I can write a little matrix
you know if red now the probability is
zero that I'll see red next um
probability is zero that I'll see yellow
next but probability is one that I'll
see green next. And so for for yellow I
can say well probability is zero I'll
see red next and so forth but
probability is um one let's see if it's
yellow then I will see red I'm sorry if
it's yellow I'll see red next but I
won't see green next and so forth.
>> So there's a sequence of experiences and
probabilities attached to those
sequences and you could take that
traffic light analogy and now put it to
the human experience which doesn't just
have three options but trillions of
experiences.
>> Trillions. That's right. So, so now
go from three. I did three to keep it
simple, but you can just see about the
transitions, but you have trillions of
experiences. So, now I'm going to model
you with a pretty big matrix. It's a
trillion by a trillion. That's a big
number. I don't even know what a
trillion squared is. It's it's it's a
big number. So, there's a trillion
squared
transition probabilities in this thing.
And and that's what I'm going to use to
describe. Is there inherent limitations
there? Cuz would you say there is a an a
fixed finite number of possible
experiences on offer in human perception
or is it potentially infinite?
My guess is that our experiences in this
particular headset of space and time are
immense
but 0% of the total possible experiences
that that that are outside of this
headset. So, so I'm I'm not sure if if
if it if our experience in the headset
is infinite or not, but even if it's
infinite, it's 0% of the infinity
beyond.
>> Uhhuh. And a trillion by trillion is a
big enough database.
>> That's enough for going. Yeah.
>> That's enough to challenge my my little
computer.
>> And and so that's that's couldn't be
simpler, right? I mean, the it's it's
basically saying you have it's very
simple. You have experiences and they
change. I'll just write down the
probabilities that they change. So,
of course, I'm not telling you what an
experience is. I'm just saying I'm going
to start with experiences. Instead of
starting with space and time and
physical objects and trying to explain
experiences,
which hasn't worked, you know, we can't
explain the taste of mint even. I'm
going to say, okay, every assump every
theory starts with certain assumptions.
My assumption is going to be
experiences. That's where my explanation
stops. Where did the experiences come
from? I don't know. For the physicalist,
where does spaceime come from? I don't
know. But I'm starting with spacetime.
Same here. I don't know where the
conscious experiences come from, but
that's where I'm starting because no
theory of of in science is ever the
final theory. It makes assumptions. So,
yeah, is my theory not the final theory?
Absolutely not. I'm starting with
experiences and I then
to be a good scientist have to show
where spacetime comes from. So that's so
I have to get Minowski space. I have to
get Einstein's
time dilations. Right? If you're moving
faster than if you're moving past me,
you're I see your clock moving slow, but
you see my clock moving slow if we're in
uniform um motion, non accelerated.
And I also have to explain why your
meter stick looks shorter to me and my
meter stick looks shorter to you. So no
one's come any come close to doing that
kind of thing starting with conscious
experiences.
>> This is where trace logic comes in
>> now. I can do I can do this like I can
do this and this is something we've just
discovered since the last time we
talked. I I didn't have this. I was
looking at traces. So So I I have to
tell you what the trace logic is but
I'll just say at top level where we're
going. It turns out that there are ways
of relating different observers by by
this notion of trace and this
relationship among observers that we can
specify mathematically turns out to give
us Einstein's time dilations and space
contractions
and
in a very nice clean quantitative way I
mean not not just a hand wave but
quantitatively for a particular class of
these marov matrices
and then a larger class I think will
give us the curved space times.
And those two classes together are 0% of
the Markov matrices,
which is all the rest of this universe
I've been talking about that's outside
of spaceime. And our headset sees
0% of it. But at least I can show you
exactly I I'm proposing how to get
exactly Manowski space and and curve
spacetime from from this trace logic.
So, so the so here's the idea of the
trace logic.
Let's go back to the traffic light. Keep
it simple. Suppose
I'm looking at the red, green, and
yellow traffic light. And let's let's
suppose it's um a dysfunctional sort of
a messed up traffic light. So, the
probabilities are aren't nice and clean.
Red could stay red or it could go green
or yellow and so forth.
And suppose that you're looking. So I'm
looking and you're looking, but you can
only see red and yellow. I can see red,
green, and yellow, but you can only see
red and yellow. And suppose I'm going to
take my matrix and add one thing to it.
Every time I transition,
my experience transitions from like
maybe red goes to green or red maybe red
goes back to red. It's a transition from
red to itself.
I'm going to increment a counter each
time a transition happens. So, I've got
a counter and I'm seeing red, green, and
yellow. And you and I are looking at the
same light, but you only see red and
yellow. You don't see the green. What's
going to happen to your counter compared
to my counter? Well, I'm going to be
going click every time red, green, or
yellow appears. You're only going to
click when red and yellow appear. So,
your clock is going to go slower than
mine.
It's that simple. It's just that simple.
I'm I'm proposing that time dilation in
Einstein's theory comes from the fact
that these these are so-called enhanced
Markoff chains. They're enhanced in the
sense that they're Markoff chains with a
counter. They're sometimes called
space-time chains. In in technical books
like Daniel Ravuza's Marov chains book,
they're called spacetime marov chains,
but I'll call them enhanced chains. Your
counter, if you only see red and yellow,
will go will count fewer because you
don't see the green. You only see red
and yellow. I see the green, so I get a
click for green, but you don't get a
click. That's why your counter is going
slower. Now,
that's not quite deep enough because as
I said earlier,
it's not just the case that your clock
looks slower to me, but it's also the
case that for you, my clock looks like
it's going slower to you. So, I gave a
simple example. I have to give it just a
slightly more complicated one to get the
full Einstein thing. Suppose we have a
light that has red, yellow, green, and
blue. Okay?
And you see red, yellow, green,
and I see yellow, green, and blue.
So I don't see red, you don't see blue.
We both see yellow and green.
Now,
when I look at you, I I all I can see of
you is
you under my yellow, green, and blue
looking because that's all I see is
yellow, green, and blue. You only see
red, yellow, red, yellow, and green. So,
all of all of me that you can see is the
yellow and green. That's all you can see
of me. And all I can see of you is the
yellow and and green.
So from my point of view, I'm getting
clicks for every yellow, green, and
blue,
>> but you're only getting clicks for
yellow and green. So your clock is looks
like it's going slower to me, but from
your point of view, you're getting
clicks for every red, yellow, and green.
I'm only getting the yellow and green.
So I'm going slower with respect to you.
So we get the symmetry of Einstein.
So So it it's by the way, I had this
trace logic for probably more than a
year. I was working on it and you f
first I I discovered that it was a
logic. So that was a new apparently a a
new contribution to the theory of marov
chains that
and I should say what what what what
that contribution is and what what it
means by the trace
if I have the red yellow and
green just the red yellow and green
and I look I can only see the say the
red and yellow
whatever probabilities
were governing red yellow and
are now going to they're going to
control I now I just see red and yellow
so I'm going to get just a 2x two matrix
right because red could go to red or red
can go to yellow can go to yellow can go
to red so I'm going to get a 2x2 matrix
of probabilities but it will be
controlled by the 3x3 there's some 3x3
matrix that's controlling the red yellow
and green that you see but but it will
uniquely determine what you should see
on the 2x two that's the trace the the
the smaller matrix that's determined by
the bigger one is called the trace of
the bigger one and it's unique in
general there's so if I have a big M
markoff matrix on a on a trillion states
and I take a trace on 10 that that new
probabilities on just the 10 states will
be completely determined by the trillion
by trillion but so what I discovered was
and I um I I I should say I proposed
this and then a mathematician friend of
mine Jayton Pash proved it So, so when I
say I discovered it, I needed a real
mathematician to truly discover it. So,
Chayon and I discovered it together.
We proved that it's a so-called partial
order or he proved it. He proved that
it's a partial order. I proposed it's a
partial order. And so, that's what we
mean by a logic is that technically it's
it's a partial order. It gives you the
notion of and and or negation and
implication and so for all the things
that you would need for a logic you know
like to say that um if
John is a bachelor then John is a man
right that's entailed by that if you
know and things like that if if
you could take conjunctions disjunctions
and so forth of propositions
so it turns out we get an entire logic
on the space of markoff chains and so I
call it the trace logic
And this is a new discovery. So we just
discovered in the last year and I had it
for a year and a half. And after it was
a year later I was looking at this. It
was just a few months ago maybe six
months ago. I was looking at and I
noticed what I just had described to you
that oh wow at at this stopping light
your my one person's counter could be
going slower than my counter you know
because of this trace thing. Could
no could could Einstein's time dilations
come out of that? No, that would that
would be that would be too good to be
true. Well, and and if that was that
wouldn't be enough. I have to get
Einstein's spatial contractions. The
ruler sticks have to So I said, well,
okay, let me let's see if this real.
What notion of ruler stick can we get
out of markoff chains? Right. Well, I've
got a clock, so that's that's easy. What
about the ruler stick?
Well, it turns out, so I went and did
some homework and it was there's a ruler
stick that was discovered in 2017, so
just eight years ago, published by
Doyle and Snell, two mathematicians.
And so if you have the states of a marov
chain like the red, green, and yellow,
you can talk about the distance between
states as a function of how long does it
take to get on average from the red say
to the green and back to the red. Now if
it's a if it's traffic light, so you go
a good traffic light goes red,
green, yellow, red, green, yellow. Okay?
And it's just in a cycle like that. It's
a cycle. Then the commute time, the time
it takes to get from red to say green
and back again is three because you have
to go sodium starting red one step to
green then to yellow and back to red.
That's three. And for this it's the
commute time is the same from green to
yellow is three. From yellow to red is
three is all of them are three. So for
for an n cycle, if you have a cycle of n
states, the commute time is n.
And what Doyle and Snell proved is the
commute time
is the square of the distance. So the
distance is the square root of the
commute time, the uklidian distance. And
so
I say, okay, so we actually now know
what the notion of distance is. So does
it work? I've got Einstein's
time dilation or time, you know, slowing
down of time. Do I get the rulers
contracting? And they have to contract,
by the way, in Einstein's theory, the
same factor. The the factor that is
affecting the time has to be the same
factor that's affecting the distance.
This is called the Lorren factor
in special relativity
and and the answer is the two factors
for marov chains
are not the same for almost every matrix
the 0% of the matrices
have the right thing but that 0% are the
end cycles.
So
what we find then is I get the same
quote unquote lorren factor exactly as
I'm supposed to for Einstein if I only
look at marov chains that are n cycles.
You might say well that's not fair. I
mean you're just picking out the ones
that work. Well Einstein only used light
to build spa the flat spacetime only
light. And he used the property that
light has the same speed in all inertial
frames. That was that's all he needed.
He only needed light.
So that that then puts a new burden on
me. I now have to say what mass means
and what what light means. So because
light is massless. So so photons of
light have no mass. And in Einstein's
theory,
anything that goes the speed of light
has no mass. And if you have mass, you
never travel the speed of light. That's
that's just the way it is. Why? That's
just the way it is. Again the theory
stop.
>> Yeah.
>> So I have to have a theory now of what
is the mass of an of
a marov chain. I also have to have the
notion of a speed. So the the commute
time that I just talked about which is
the average time it takes to get you
know the expected time to get from one
state to another. You can now ask for a
mark of for all the states. What's the
average commute time between all the
states? And the average will be for the
an end cycle will be n. The commute time
will be n. And it turns out that is the
the fastest commute time. That is the
the the the fastest. Any other markoff
chain that's not an end cycle will have
a longer time. So these are the fastest.
So I the one matrix that works for me to
get Einstein's time deations and length
contractions to be exactly the same is
the only matrix that is the fastest
matrix in this commute time sense the
average commute time and if I there's
good reasons and I can explain why we
can talk about something called the
entropy rate of a markoff chain as the
mass. So the idea about mass
is something that's more massive is more
influential. It interacts more with
stuff,
right? If you're close to, you know,
like if you're on Jupiter, you'd be
sucked down much more hard than than
you're sucked down on Earth. And if
you're on the moon, I mean, you can see
the astronauts were jumping way up much
higher than they could do on Earth. The
the the moon was not as influential on
>> more gravitas.
>> More more gravitas. Abs. Absolutely. So,
so the idea is there's some notion of of
influence that we needed to capture in
markoff chains. And I I'm proposing um
something called the ent what's called
the entropy rate.
Entropy rate is a big important thing in
information theory. Um it it tells you
how much you can compress data and so
forth. So it's error correcting codes
and data compression. Entropy rate is a
big big deal in this. So it's not a it's
not a new idea of mine. This was like at
the foundations of information theory.
Entropy rate is like right there at the
center. So it was not hard for me to
look at it and go that's probably the
entropy rate because that's that's the
the entropy rate is zero for the end
cycles
and
so they have zero mass.
>> So what so here's the here I'll I'll
summarize it.
I'm proposing
that these cyclic matrices
correspond to photons in spaceime.
They project
>> because they have no mass.
>> They have no mass and they're the
fastest things.
>> Does that mean there's a correlation
between light and conscious experience?
Is that the stretch?
>> Well, so so I'm these are this is
conscious experience and I'm proposing
how the very structure of spaceime
is just a conscious experience.
The very the Manowski structure of
spacetime is
literally coming from the structure of
conscious experience and this this trace
logic entirely. And so
entropy rate is projecting to mass. Zero
entropy rate is projecting to zero mass.
The only things that have zero entropy
rate move at the speed of light. So what
Einstein couldn't explain, he had to
assume. I'm explaining. I'm saying that
the reason
massive objects cannot travel at the
speed of light is because no matrix with
positive entropy rate has a commute time
as as fast as the n cycles. They just
don't. That's why. Why is the speed of
light the same for all observers in all
inertial frames? because the trace of an
end cycle is an end cycle when I take so
it's always the same speed one state per
step one new state per step in an end
cycle so what what Einstein has to
assume oh and so so Einstein has to
assume that the speed of light is the
same in all inertial frames and I don't
I explain why it's the same and why is
there no preferred inertial frame the
answer is because in this trace logic of
of matrix. There's no top matrix.
There's you can go to infinity in
infinite number of directions and
there's no top. So there's no special
final
inertial frame.
>> So so the bottom line is
a theory of consciousness outside of
spacetime with these marov matrices.
Identify
mass as the entropy rate. Identify the
clock counter as is is projecting to
time. Identify the commute times
between states as projecting to distance
and you get manowski space coming up.
Now
I've shown it qualitatively here.
Uh what we have to do now is to show ma
with mathematical precision. I can take
um discrete mark of n cycles maybe three
of them for example interacting
and as n goes to infinity I have to show
that I can get in probably using
something called Laurent Gromov
housedorf
techniques
prove that I get exactly the structure
of manowski So that that hasn't been
proven but but we know
>> that's what you're working on now.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> We're working on that now.
>> So but what we do have is qualitatively
>> we get the space contraction the time
dilation they match. The interesting
thing is
I mentioned that
Doyle and
and uh his colleague that wrote the
Doyles paper
um on Marov chains that the commute time
is
the square of the uklitian distance. So
the ukitian distance has to be the
square root. So what I so to make things
work I need to also take the time
counter the counter of the conscious
agents and take its square root to get
the time and spaceime. So now you might
say well that seems like a cluge. It's
very interesting.
In physics there's something called
charge par time symmetry CPT symmetry.
And I think we're going to get that from
the fact that when we take the square
root, you you can have either plus or
minus. When I take the commute time and
take the square root of it to get the
distance, well, there's a plus distance
and a minus distance.
And when I take the time square root,
again, there'll be a plus and minus
time. I believe that that will give us
what's called CPT symmetry in in in
physics, which which has been shown
empirically. So if this is right, then
not only do I explain why the speed of
light is the same in all inertial
frames, why no massive object can ever
travel at the speed of light, why all
why no inertial frame is special, but
also where CPT symmetry comes from. It
comes from the fact that the conscious
agent dynamics is not inside spaceime
and we need to take square roots to get
the space lengths and clock times that
we see inside spacetime. It's that fact
that gives us the CPT symmetry. So,
so I should say summarize what we have
and what we don't.
What we have is a trace logic that's
secure. That's a new contribution to the
theory of marov chains. That trace logic
for
n cycles gives us exactly the right
contractions of length
and time forming calcium space when for
other matrices those contractions will
be different the lengths and time
contractions will be different and for
those some of them I'm proposing this we
haven't proved that they will project
two curved spacetimes because the
lengths and times are are are different.
They're not exactly the same. So you
won't get flat space time. You'll get
curved. I think that that will be a
larger class of matrices that that work,
but I think there'll still be 0% of all
the matrices. And my guess is that
almost all the matrices in consciousness
space are too complicated. They'll have
things like they'll have expander graphs
and other weird properties to them that
will preclude them from projecting into
spaceime. So spacetime isn't the final
reality. It's a trivial
0%
of the new reality that's unfolding when
we step outside of spaceime and say
let's what's our our simplest most drop
deadad stupid model of consciousness we
can come up with. That's what I came up
with came up with the stupidest drop
deadad simple model. You have
experiences and they change
probabilistically. Okay, what can we do
with that? Doesn't sound very promising,
right? Going to get all of space-time
physics out of that
small chance. And that was my until I
discovered the trace logic. And then all
of a sudden in the last six months, I
realized, holy smoke,
it could be this simple. It's really
what is the trace logic? It's saying how
the experiences of different observers
mesh.
That's what it's about. It's all about
observers and their experiences. There's
an infinite class of observers and we
can talk about
their time counters and observers that
see smaller set of states than me, their
time counter is going to go slower than
mine and so forth.

Back to the episode.
Can I try I want to try to explain this
back to you to see if I actually
understand it or at least an aspect of
it cuz I was kind of I think whenever
I'm preparing for something especially
something that can get pretty rigorous
in the scientific side, I try to
like write it out to be able to explain
it to myself and see if I actually
understand it. So
quantum mechanics says that particles
are described by wave functions.
>> Yes.
>> Probability waves that evolve smoothly
but collapse when measured. Um and so
your point basically is that if you look
at the long-term dynamics of these
markoff chains instead of the
step-by-step
uh transitions, the math looks identical
to quantum wave functions.
>> Right? That's something I haven't talked
about yet here.
>> Okay. Right. But so in other words,
quantum theory is what you see when you
zoom out on the probabilistic flow of
conscious experiences. So quantum states
aren't fundamental. They're the shadow
of deeper dynamics of consciousness.
Right.
>> I know you kind of alluded to a little
bit earlier, but I haven't spoken
directly to the kind of correlation
there between the two.
>> Yeah, I should I should say a little bit
about that. So So what I've done so far
is to talk about how a theory of
consciousness with the Marov chains and
the trace logic could give rise to the
structure of Einstein's
um Minowski space spacetime but of
course quantum theory is extremely
important and so how does that come out
of this right um and so here's here's
the remarkable thing that my my
collaborator Chaitton Pash um discovered
about 10 years ago or so if you look at
I've been talking about the stepby-step
markoff chain if it's red now the light
and then maybe it'll turn green next and
then yellow and so forth that's step by
But then when you zoom out,
>> if you step back, you know, sort that's
sort of like looking at a movie one
frame at a time. But if you step back
and you try to look at the whole movie
in in real time, you get a different
different picture. And when we look at
Markov chain, not a step by step, we
look back at the big picture of what's
happening in the dynamics of the markup
chain, the big movie. We call that the
um well the way you do that is you
compute what are called the harmonic
functions of these enhanced chains. So
you compute the harmonic functions and
they tell you the long-term behavior
these harmonic functions. And what
Chayton discovered is these harmonic
functions are exactly the same
mathematical functions as quantum wave
functions for free particles. So the
quantum wave functions for free
particles and the harmonic functions of
the markoff chains that we're looking at
are the same thing.
>> What does that mean? So it means that
we're proposing
that spacetime is constructed just by
the end cycles of markoff chains in the
way I just described and quantum wave
functions are describing not the
detailed dynamics of conscious
experiences they're giving just the top
level picture of it not the step by step
we have in other words in this
consciousness framework I'm telling you
every step of the way what's going on.
And in the space-time headset, quantum
mechanics just says, you don't need to
look at all those details. Here's just
what's happening long term. You only get
to see the the big long-term picture.
I'm showing you that what's are called
the hidden variables. This is what's
called a hidden variables theory of
quantum mechanics. Okay? So, these
hidden variables are things that you you
don't see inside. They're they're hidden
to um quantum mechanics. Quantum
mechanics doesn't describe them, but
they're right there in the harmonic
functions of the Markov chains. And
what's interesting about the harmonic
functions, right, everything is real.
All the numbers are real in my markoff
chain. All the probabilities are real
and so forth. But when you take these
harmonic functions, you get complex
numbers as part of taking the harmonic
function. So where does all the
weirdness of complex amplitudes come
from? It's because you're not looking at
the full reality. you're getting the top
level gloss harmonic functions and those
use complex numbers to describe the
long-term behavior of it. So, so we get
spacetime and quantum theory coming out.
Now, I I'm saying this at the top level.
I I I already said a theorem that we
need to prove about spacetime, right? So
we have to prove that the the Lorent
Gromov housef convergence works from n
cycles to
to manowski space. And then we have to
prove that that sim similar kind of
convergence will work for curved
spacetime for a slightly larger class of
of of
matrices. And and then we need to show
for example um
well two things. first
why we're not violating Bell's theorem.
So there's something called Bell's
theorem which says there aren't any
hidden variables theory roughly. So here
I am not saying I've got a hidden
variable theory of quantum mechanics.
Most people in the know would say well
John Bell proved that there aren't any.
So you're off your rocker. What what
John Bell proved was that there were no
hidden variables theories that were
measurement,
independent,
local,
and deterministic.
But our theory is not measurement
independent. In fact, it's observers. If
anything's measurement dependent,
they're observers. So, we have a
measurement dependent system. is
probabilistic and it's not
deterministic. So, so John Bell's
theorem is true and it doesn't apply to
us because
we're non-local. We're not we're we're
not deterministic and we're measurement
dependent. So, so, so Bell's theorem is
true and it doesn't rule out our hidden
variables theory at at all. So, so we
now have to prove
so that that part's clear. But now what
we have to prove is there's something
called the borne rule
in quantum theory. The Borne rule says
if you have this quantum
complex amplitude the wave function you
have to take the amplitude squared to
find out the probability of various
outcomes occurring. That's very famous
Borne rule.
So,
I've done some a little work on it and I
think it's going to be true. But until
you prove it, but I'll put it this way.
I see no obstruction
at all. I see no obstruction to getting
curved spacetime. I see no obstruction
to getting the Borne rule. Um,
but
these are very very technical
mathematical issues. Um, and so until we
have it, we we can only I So I won't
promise more than I've can say right
now. What we do have is
the trace logic is real. That's that's
that's not going away. The time dilation
space contraction for the n cycles,
that's not going away. That that'll be
there. um the claim that that will give
rise specifically to Manowski space. We
know the theorem that needs to be proven
and we haven't proven it yet but I don't
see any obstructions but but again I'm
just a cognitive scientist um so this is
real math so we'll see uh I I don't see
any obstructions right now but it may we
may need some really hard-nosed
technical mathematical physicists to to
bring this stuff home. So, so we've it's
just been in the last few weeks that
I've even known that these are the
theorems we need to prove. So, this is
this is brand new. This is the first
time I've actually talked about this.
>> It's exciting.
>> Yeah, it's pretty exciting.
>> It is exciting. And I know probably
aspects of it can definitely go over
many people's head. I know for for
different parts it does. It does for me
like it
>> there's there's a lot to digest there.
But the spark notes, correct me if I'm
wrong, is that if the bedrock of modern
physics and relativity and quantum
theory can naturally fall out of this
theory or this model of conscious
observers, then it kind of reverses the
chain of causality of what we think
consciousness is coming out of a coming
out of matter. Rather, it's the other
way around.
>> That that's exactly right. And this is
something that the physicist John
Wheeler was was pointing to. So you you
got it right. And and and John Wheeler
was pointing in this direction. He had a
paper in 1989 that's called the it from
bit paper.
>> But he was he was basically saying
somehow it's all it's got to be from his
point of view all these observer
participency interactions
has to be the fundamental thing. And
somehow he said that has to give rise to
the structure of spacetime and quantum
theory. didn't know how but but he he
just felt like we can't start inside
spaceime we have to start with the
observer participency thing and and and
so so the reason he's he's taken
seriously is I mean he was like the
adviser for Richard Feman and he he
himself was an incredible physicist on
his own right so so so
and he in his from bit paper wheeler
cited I mean I've been I should say I've
been working on this stuff um for a long
time almost 40 years. So I mean it's
it's not like I decided to work on
consciousness outside of spacetime. I've
been working on it since
>> 89
>> 85.
So it's been literally 40 years
>> 80 1985 and in 1989 I published a book
with two mathematicians okay
>> called observer mechanics. So you know
you can see I was already I've been this
is not like a new gig for me
>> and and Wheeler cited my book. So in his
it forbit paper he cites my book as an
example of the kind of thing that we
might want try to do in this observer
participency kind of thing and I I read
Wheeler's paper of course and and and
I agreed with him and I we tried to get
into observer mechanics but we didn't
have the trace logic and I didn't have
the trace logic until a year and a half
ago and I didn't know what I had until 6
months ago. So, so I've been after this
for for 40 years. And just six months
ago, I think I found the key that I've
been looking for for for 40 years. And
so, and it's also what the kind of thing
that that Frank Wilchek was saying is we
need to have some notion of the observer
as as as as a a foundational concept.
So, what I'm saying is that Wheeler was
right. It's all these acts of observer
participy that somehow build spacetime
and the thing that coordinates them is
the trace logic. It's the trace logic
which is just the coordination of how
your experiences and my experience are
how your clock is related to my clock.
How and how the the distances between
your experiences are related to the
distances and my experiences. That the
trace logic does all of that and when we
compress it down we get spaceime. So
physics
from this point of view the space-time
physics is nothing but a beautiful way
of coordinating all the experiences of
the observers.
So
it changes the whole thing around.
>> Yeah. We thought of ourselves
in science
for the last four centuries as as little
tiny
physical objects in an immense physical
universe whose consciousness emerge from
unconscious ingredients.
And this is turning the whole picture
around. Spacetime is not fundamental. We
know that it falls apart of the plank
scale. It can't be fundamental. That
picture can't be right.
But Wheeler's picture is a deeper
picture. Observer participancy
outside of spaceime gets somehow
fashioned into the structure that we
call spacetime. But the it's the
consciousness that's first. It's
fundamental and it gives rise to what we
call spacetime.
And it's the trace logic.
And and and and by the way,
the trace logic is not hard.
I could have thought about it 40 years
ago. I just didn't think about it.
>> It's it's not that hard. Uh I don't know
why it took me 40 years. I'm I'm not
that bright.
>> Do you remember the moment that came to
you? You said you were in a car or were
>> I was I was at I think I was at home and
we one problem that we've been working
on is how do observers or what we call
conscious agents but we'll call them
observer how do they combine
and I have you know Chaitton Pash and
Robert Prrenner two really good
brilliant friends of mine longtime
collaborators and they they had been
debating back and forth about a new way
of combination and And I looked at what
they were saying and I just looked at
and it felt wrong and and but but when I
felt that it was wrong, I also felt
here's why it's wrong
and all of a sudden I saw the trace
logic. It was it was so it was in
reaction to the trying to figure out how
to combine observers and and seeing
their ideas,
seeing that I disagreed with those ideas
and asking myself why do I disagree with
those ideas? And that's when I saw the
trace logic structure. All of a sudden,
I just saw it.
I said because in the trace logic, it
turns out it gives you a way to join two
consciousnesses into a single new
conscious observer. And that so it was
that problem. How do I take two separate
consciousness that maybe overlap? Maybe
we have some similar conscious
experiences, but how do we join them
together into a coherent new observer?
The trace logic does that. It tells you
exactly what that what that that join
means. So it's something I didn't talk
about. This is actually in terms of the
theory of consciousness. This is also a
breakthrough.
It's a it's a breakthrough that says if
you have two consciousnesses that do
overlap, what is the unique bigger
consciousness
that could be made out of them that
traces down properly to each of the two
separate consciousness?
>> Infinite shared space or source which is
the origin of shared experience.
>> Well, well, so these are prior to that.
So the the the well the source is deeper
than output. The what you're talking
about the source is is even deeper. This
was just a step up on the trace logic
itself. So how do I go from two
conscious consciousnesses, two Markoff
chains to a slightly bigger markoff
chain that properly contracts down to
the two? So it's it's very much like
the way I think about it. You have two
hemispheres in your brain, a left and a
right.
And there are some experiments which
have been done with split brain
patients. So people who had
problems with epilepsy that couldn't be
cured or controlled with drugs.
Um there were,
you know, surgeries done where you would
take off the top of the skull, take a
knife. The guys who did this was a guy
named Joe Bogan's one of the surgeons. I
actually was friends with him. We would
meet periodically at um UCI and and talk
consciousness and so forth. But Joe
Bogan would take a scalpel and cut the
corpus colossum which is a so you have
two hemispheres. There's an Ethernet
cable between them connecting them and
he cut that cable part of it or all of
it depending on the on the patient. And
what they found was the the hemispheres
now had their their biggest connection
was severed. There are some smaller
connections, but the biggest connection
was was severed. And Michael Gazan and
others then did some experiments on
these patients and found that you know
they wanted to know what's going on what
what does this connection do and what
happens when you separate the
hemispheres and early experiments
couldn't find anything different about
these people. Um, so some people
thought, well, the only thing the uh
corpus colossum does is is is put
epileptic seizures from one hemisphere
to the other. That's all that's all it's
good for. Well, no, of course that's not
the case. So, what Gazanica found was
that he he could isolate information to
the hemispheres. It turns out that the
right hemisphere only sees the left
visual field. Left hemisphere sees only
the right visual field. And the left
hemisphere gets input from the right
side of the body. the right hemisphere
gets input from the left side of the
body. So if you give information to just
the left visual field quickly before you
can do an eye movement, you can send
something just to the left visual field
and only the right hemisphere sees it.
Or put something in the right visual
field, only the left hemisphere sees it.
But if it's on there for more than a
tenth of a second, then you'll get an
eye movement and both hemispheres will
see it. So that's why they didn't they
couldn't figure it out before they, you
know, people were doing eye movements
and both hemispheres got the
information. So, but Gazanaga learned to
and and Roger Sperry. So, I should, you
know, Sperry won the Nobel Prize for
this. So, it would be
>> We just had Ian McGillchrist in here,
too. We were actually speaking about
this.
>> Okay. Very, very good. Yeah. So, so what
you find is that the two hemispheres
have very different personalities in
some cases. In one case, the left
hemisphere wanted to be uh have a desk
job and the right hemisphere wanted to
be a race car driver. The left
hemisphere believes in God, the right
hemisphere is an atheist or or vice
versa. So, so here's the notion of
joint. So, I said all that for this
trace joint. Somehow
you
have two hemispheres which if we cut the
corpus close enough show that they are
different personalities with different
religious beliefs,
different job aspirations. They're
different. It seems like maybe part of
the human condition is we're born with
two. We're actually you're not just one
person. You're two people. And what you
are learning to do in this body is join
them. How do I
create the join?
>> The two becoming one.
>> Two becoming one and cooperating. And
for a lot of us, it's not an easy
process. I get pissed off at myself and
what are you doing that for? And you can
imagine actually in some of these with
the corpus close and cut, the hands
fight each other. The left hand and the
right hand fight. So, so that's in all
of us that. So, so this join of the
trace logic I I I was after it because I
understood Roger Sperry's work and and
Joe Bogan. I mean, I knew Joe Bogan
personally. We're friends. I knew all
this stuff. It's very clear that there's
some kind of separate person's
consciousnesses that are being
integrated. And the corpus colossum is
not the whole story, but it's it's the
physical aspect of of it. And so I was
after that join in the trace logic
because I I knew that that would be the
key thing. If if this was going to work,
it would have it would be that to give
us our first principled theory of how
separate consciousnesses can join
together because this has been a big
problem in consciousness first theories.
It's the combination problem. This if
you look it up if you just Google the
combination problem in pansychus
theories of consciousness you'll see
there's a big literature basically it's
it's like can't be done you if now
pansyus theories are very different from
my theory
>> what is the combination problem for
people that don't know
>> so the combination problem is how if if
I have um two separate consciousnesses
can they be combined into a single
consciousness can Can can the subjects
of experience be combined and can the
experiences themselves be combined? So
there's the subject combination problem
and the experience combination problem
and and um
they're very you know um it's it's an
ancient ancient problem. Um
there are
the received opinion was that this is
going to be difficult if if not
impossible.
um
to to combine the different experiences.
Um
so so so I knew that that would you know
that's that's been out there for a long
time. Everybody says can't be done and
certainly you you can't combine subjects
of of experience. Um
the very famous psychologist William
James in his principles of psychology
has a very famous paragraph in there
about you can't combine the subjects of
experience. You if you have a 10
different people or 100 different people
um how how are you going to combine
them? You can tell them all the same
thing but it's going to be 100 different
people thinking the same thing. Not the
subjects don't combine. So,
so I I was, you know, these are this has
been a long-standing problem and I was
hoping that somehow this theory of, you
know, conscious agents with the Marco
stuff would give me some tools for
understanding how consciousness could
combine because it seems like that's
going on there. The corpus colossum
seems to be something that's mediating
that in the case of of our two
hemispheres.
And so you can see why we're I was going
after this notion of join but I didn't
have a principled way of
coming at the join
and it was the comp the the trace logic
is where and then and the trace logic
all of a sudden by seeing this partial
order this this logic
it automatically has a join and that
solves the problem but what I had to do
was step back and see the bigger picture
and see there's a whole logic so don't
just think about the join
Think about an entire logic on the space
of consciousnesses and when you see the
whole logic on it then the join falls
out and and so it was that insight it's
like so so what is the logic is the
trace
is the trace a partial order being a
trace is that a partial order
and I could im immediately see there
there's three things you have to have
for a partial order it has to be
reflexive
um symmetric and um transitive and I
could see the first two but I couldn't
see the transitive. I it looked to me
like transit there it was going to be
transitive as well. Um
so I I could see two out of the three
right away. I and the third one looked
really
I mean it looked pretty
pretty secure to me but you know math is
math. So I I said it I told my my my
longtime collaborator Chayan we have
collaborated about 40 years. So we're
we're good friends.
I I said I think I've found this logic
that I think the trace is a logic on the
space of all Marco chains. And he said
Don it's too pretty. Can't be true. It's
just too pretty. And he was taking off
for a conference in in England. So he he
flew. But when he landed in Heathrow he
said well I'll give it a shot. And there
in Heathro he proved it. He proved that.
He proved the the transitivity and then
we knew we had a logic and then I but it
took me almost a year
to see okay cuz I was I was focused on
the join and combination problem and
that stuff and so I was really pretty h
I thought I'd gotten everything out of
it that I possibly could and I was very
very happy but just one day I noticed
well wait the trace the counter
is going to click fewer times on the
trace than on the bigger one.
could no I I couldn't get spacetime out
of this. No way. But I decided to check
it out and and it's been a six-month fun
ride. Um I can't believe it. So I didn't
expect to get spacetime. I was just
trying to get the combination problem.
>> Yeah.
>> And
length contractions and time
contractions. Unbelievable. I can't
believe I got it.
>> You just ordered a a single meal and the
whole buffet came with it. It
>> it it came with it. and and and
then the fact that
it it was the square that the dis the
the commute times are the square of the
distances
is it must be there I mean a good sign
that there's a
>> inherent simplicity I suppose or beauty
to something that is coherent. Uh so
like there's
not maybe maybe not always the case but
throughout many different innovations
and discoveries in the past there is an
inherent beauty to the simplicity of the
discovery which seems almost
uh like too good to be true at first. I
I I couldn't agree more. And what's
what's really interesting about the
trace logic is there's no wiggle room.
It's fixed. I can't play with it. It
either worked or it didn't.
So, so I knew I I was either going to
get Einstein's theory or not. There was
no way for me to fiddle this thing
because the the the the trace logic
can't be fiddled with. That's I mean the
trace is the trace end of story. It's a
So, it either did it or not. So, I
it was too good to be true. I couldn't
believe that it that it worked. So,
yeah. assigning
physical interpretations of properties
of the matrix is no there's no place
really to fudge there commute times are
commute times that's you you can't fudge
entropy rate is entropy rate to to say
if you ask what are the properties that
could be mass entropy rate is it and so
it either worked or it didn't if the
entropy rate being zero didn't
correspond to the matrices that that
moved fastest then it would be game over
for me the whole will be over. So, so
right now there's no room to fudge at
all in any of this, which is makes me
feel very very comfortable because that
it will either completely unravel and
and we'll see the one thread that
doesn't work and the whole thing
unravels or the or the thing is really
going to take off. I'm hoping it takes
off and it looks like it's taking off
because at every step I've said, "Okay,
this has to be true or the whole thing
won't work. Let me go check." It is
true. Unbelievable. I've been surprised
time and again that it's worked. So even
as as Chaitan said, he he thought the
whole thing was too beautiful to be
true.
>> Yeah.
>> So we both thought at every step this is
too pretty to be true. It's it's you
know the party's going to be over and we
haven't seen the party over yet. So but
the fact is it can't be fudged. So if
the party's over, it will show us the
party's over,
>> which is the
reward of the scientific mind to go
after disproving things that you would
like to be true to to make it rigorous,
right? And uh
>> absolutely and and of course what I said
earlier about all scientific theories
applies to to my theory.
>> There's a going to be a limited scope
for this theory of conscious agents and
the trace logic. But
all I'm trying to do right now is to
show that the scope is bigger than
spacetime and the scope includes
spacetime that we can actually build
spaceime from the trace logic of
conscious. So I'm not saying that this
is a final theory of everything. No, I
will be very clear. This is 0% of
reality. My theory is 0% of reality, but
it's a bigger 0% than spacetime. And and
if I can show how spacetime is a smaller
0% than my bigger 0% of reality, that's
a step. Science will always and only
know 0% of reality. Always and only. But
we should do it
for many reasons we'll continue to get
into. Now, what is minimizing surprise
uh and uh how it comes into all of this
for people that have like zero context
of what that means,
>> right? So
the idea of minimizing surprise
um is is quite big now in in cognos
science and and elsewhere. Um Carl
Rston's and his collaborators are using
it and it's related to intelligence in
in in the following way.
I mean I'm not going to say it's all
there is to intelligence but it's an
important aspect of intelligence. If
every time I did something I was
surprised,
like every time I went went to pick up
this cup, it fell down and crashed.
Every time I put on a shirt, I ripped a
hole in it. Every time I walked up the
stairs, I fell on my face. Well, to the
extent that I'm surprised, I'm not very
smart. So, in some sense, the more
surprised you are, the less intelligent
you are. Now, now again, I'm I'm not at
all saying that's the only aspect of
intelligence, but it is intelligence is
not less than no surprise or or minimal
surprise.
Now,
suppose I have a a big markup matrix.
Well, I'll just say the bottom line.
Trace minimizes surprise. That's the
trace logic is the logic of minimizing
surprise. when you have a probabilistic
situation, you don't know what's going
to happen and all you can do is write
down a marov dynamics of it. Um, and and
then if you have limited information, I
can only see this these set of states. I
can't see the whole traffic light. I can
only see red and green or whatever,
but I want to minimize surprise. The
trace is the minimal surprise answer. So
the trace logic is the logic of
minimizing surprise and in that sense it
is the logic of intelligence. So now
there are there are new companies
working to go past large language models
of artificial intelligence. I'm using um
the free energy principle to to
minimizing free energy to to minimize
surprise. What they really want to do is
minimize surprise but they can't do it
directly. So they minimize free energy.
The trace logic does it directly. It
tells you exactly what the answer is.
You give me any context and you give me
a subset of variables. The trace is the
minimum surprise answer. If you want to
take two probabilistic systems, you know
both probab probabilistic systems and
you want to know what's the minimal
surprise
system that includes them both. It's the
join of the trace logic the the
disjunction of the trace logic. So it is
the the the logic of surprise. So I I
didn't know this at first. I was only
thinking about just consciousness
combining and trying to solve the
combination problem. Then I was
interested in wow maybe spacetime comes
out of it you know because of the
changing clocks. But then more recently
I've realized no this is this minimizes
surprise this is actually logic of of
intelligence. So it could actually be of
value tech technologically to be the a
core mathematical principle behind a new
generation of artificial intelligences,
which would be great fun for me because
as I mentioned to you,
I I was in the AI lab at MIT from 1979
to 1983.
took class with Marvin Minsky, worked
with Mertold Horn and David Maher and
Eric Grimson and Ellen Hilddrth. I mean
the I'm friends with all the pioneers in
the early AI computational vision work
there and John Hollerback. Um so it's
it's a it's a real love of mine the
artificial intelligence and to have the
trace logic actually be a logic of
intelligence is blows my mind as well.
So I
Once I worked on the consciousness side
of things, I may want to switch over and
look at the AI side of it as well.
>> Yeah,
so much to explore there as well. I'm
curious
because it's been alluded to throughout
the conversation about when we're
talking about the experience of a
conscious observer. As a human being, we
have this experience which to a degree
there is an overlap in what we think
your experience is. And I'm curious how
you think of as you introduced in your
essay that you sent me the sense of
infinite shared space or the source in
which our experience is derived. What do
you what do you make of that source in
which experience is dry from? That's a
that's a good question. So
when you write down a mark of chain like
for the red, green, yellow traffic
light, you mathematically you before you
can write down the matrix, you have to
specify what we call a measurable space.
This is a mathematical name. But all it
means is you need to tell me what states
are going to be in your markup chain
like red, green, and yellow. So you have
to say there are three straits and
they're red, green, and yellow. And then
you have to put a structure called an
algebra on them.
But basically, so it's a measurable
space. You list the states and you put
some kind of structure on them.
Now,
if you have five states, then you need
to have, you know, even if it's red,
green, yellow, blue, orange, light, then
you need to have five states in a bigger
measurable space. in the trace logic.
If you're going to think about all these
matrices
in the in the context of the trace
logic, then they can't each have their
own little measurable space because you
have to be able to relate all of them
together. So you need a big measurable
space in which they're all on. So
effectively an infinite measurable
space. So I need to write down an
infinite measurable space of all
possible conscious experiences with its
own sigma algebra which is the the logic
the um structure on it.
So I can't just write down three. It's
it's infinite and it's the same for all
observers. All these different traces
are all different observers.
So the logic itself forces me. It says,
"Don, you cannot just talk about a
three-state measurable space and then a
10 state. You have to put them all on
one. They're all derived from one big
measurable structure."
Now, so then and we're this is the
mathematics forcing. So at at just just
a couple weeks ago, I said, "Okay, so
what is the mathematics trying to tell
me here?" I mean, so I I'm I've been
working on the matrices and their trans
transitions. I'm studying that. I'm
getting spaceime
dilations and so forth coming out of it.
But what about this deeper structure?
It's just sitting there. It's timeless.
It's there for every different observer.
And it's and in some sense all the
experiences are popping out of this deep
structure. Sounds very mystical. It
sounds very mystical to me. I was like,
what do but but but
it's math. I have to write it down. I'm
forced to write it down. And so I'm
forced to ask myself, what's my
interpretation of this? I've got my
interpretation of the states and their
transitions. They're experiences and
changing experiences. What is this
structure that's timeless
from which in some sense all these
experiences are coming out of and the
answer is I don't know. This is where my
understanding stops. So I just call it
source because it's the source of all
the experiences.
and but it's a timeless source and it's
the same for all observers and it's the
foundation from which all observers all
traces spring. So then I I agree. Then I
at that point I thought, wait a minute,
that does sound quite mystical and and
and very much like what mystics have
been saying for for thousands of years
that that we're all derived from one
source
and
in some sense we're we're just different
emanations they would say from the
source. I would say we're different
headsets that the source has put on the
different traces are different headsets
by which the the source looks at itself.
So that's the way I'm thinking about it
now is that there is this source. I
can't say anything more about it than
that than except what the mathematics
says right now which is it's the same
for all observers. So
Andre and Don are
from the same source, just different
headsets. It's the source talking to the
source through Andre and Don headsets.
And I can't say anything more about the
source. I can say we can write down a
measurable structure for it. There's a
sigma algebra. So I can say all that
stuff.
But that's where my that's the limits of
my theory. Every theory has limits.
There we go. The other limits are my
probabilities. The prob when you see a
probability in a theory, that's where
the explanation stops because
probability is where I can't say
anything more. I'll write down a
probability measure. So, so my theory
has the limits right there in our face.
Um but the limit it points right where
the spiritual traditions have pointed
saying that there is some source
and they will say it transcends any
description.
You can point to it with words but as
the da da says the the towel that can be
spoken of is not the true and that the
same is true of science. the the science
can point to it.
Um
but and we can describe perspectives on
it. So for example, space-time
perspective that particular headset,
our mathematical descriptions can be
more or less accurate descriptions of
that particular
projection or trace of the one source.
So, so not any it's not the case that
everything is equal and my theory, you
know, earth, air, fire and water is just
as good as the standard model of
particle. No, not at all. In a headset,
certain theories are better and certain
theories are worse, provably.
So, so the science is right to be really
hard-nosed about the theories.
Absolutely. Most theories are going to
be wrong about our headset. But when we
go outside the headset, it's going to be
again just a broader headset that we're
looking at. So again, it'll be more true
or false. But ultimately, you know that
all of our theories, even our best
hard-nosed theories are 0% of reality.
But at least we want to get that 0%
right. And most theories are not even
right about that 0%. So that's why most
non-scientific theories aren't worth the
time.
They they you know, science gets 0% but
it gets it right.
>> Yeah.
I'm curious how you would describe what
I've heard you explain of infinite
infinities. If there's an potentially
infinite amount of available
experiences,
that means that there would then be an
infinite amount of conscious observers.
So what does that point to about the
scope of reality beyond the headset?
>> It's the headset, our space-time
headset. You we think of spaceime as the
final reality.
No, it's 0%. It's literally 0% of
reality. And in the Marov
dynamics that I'm looking at, it's 0 I
can say what 0% corresponds to Mowski
space. Um, I'm looking to be able to say
what what slightly larger 0% corresponds
to curved space times. And then the
99.99999%
of it basically 100% of it will be
beyond anything that could be actually
presented in space and time. Again,
partly for technical reasons like again
expander graphs for the markoff chains
and as opposed you know things that
wouldn't work well for general
relativity.
So, so but the interesting thing is I
mean spiritual traditions have been
saying this for thousands of years
but now we have a new mathematical
framework where we can say at least for
one step out of spaceime headset here is
a description of the infinities these
markoff chains that don't project into
spaceime
even curve spacetime they don't project
this is a first model to explore of the
kinds of infinities of possibilities
outside of our space-time hazard. Before
we all we could say in the spiritual
traditions was um it's it's beyond what
you can see of in space and time. All of
a sudden now we have a mathematical
model that says well I'm not the final
reality either. But here is a way that
we can talk about the next step outside
of the headset and there's infinite
there's an infinite number of new things
to explore here.
So there's plenty to explore and that
infinite number of new things to explore
here is 0%
of reality, but it's infinitely bigger
than the 0% that we had now. So we've
just expanded to a new an infinitely
larger space that's 0% of the final
reality. And that's the way science will
always progress
if it progresses. What this really makes
me think of is
if you look on the planet right now, we
very much so have medieval minds and
modern tools. We have
>> Mhm. uh incredibly increasingly exponent
exponential uh technologies that in a
time where we face this meta crisis
where we could you know the wisdom to
hold those tools is not to the same
degree we have and what these tools can
do. You look from bioweapons to AIS
you know all all over the place. We need
a uh radical transformation in
consciousness and and change in
paradigm. And it seems like the way that
could effectively happen is by these
deeper understandings becoming
self-evident by the scientific method
and and them becoming rigorous. You
know, if you are able to effectively
prove to the analytical mind that we
have this shared space, that we are one
consciousness. A lot of the what what
we've been exploring today that to me
changes the what the the scientific
paradigm and prevailent notion of what
reality is like on a on a widespread
scale to where it feels like the one of
the if not the only saving graces
um in the coming decades where if we if
it if something that discoveries like
this don't come at this time humanity
very much though is in a position where
you know we could go extinct. So
that's I I just feel like the immensity
of it and it doesn't it rarely happens
on this podcast where I'm having a
conversation around something to
somebody who's at the leading forefront
of a discovery that I feel like truly
can be completely worldchanging. So
yeah, it just feels like I feel like
both the beauty and the weight of
conversations like this. Yeah, I think
that's an important point about this and
that is that if the spiritual traditions
have said for a long long time that that
we all are from from the one but there's
been no beef right as we talked about
before it gives us no technology the
physicalist framework gives us all the
technology it gives us all the miracles
no miracles are uncontested miracles are
coming from the spiritual side so it's
easy for people to dismiss we're all on
and you should love your neighbor as
yourself and and and so forth because
you that doesn't work. It doesn't give
us technology. Um and so you're just a
physical
system. Your consciousness emerges from
your brain somehow. And when your brain
is destroyed, you're gone. And you and I
are definitely not connected. We're
we're just separate bits of matter. that
that whole framework changes. If we have
a theory of consciousness that actually
transcends what physicalist science can
do, then all of a sudden now the smart
money is no longer on physicalist
reductionist kinds of views.
If the if the new technology and the new
deeper scientific theory shows that
spacetime is not fundamental and it has
this, you know, like with the trace
logic, this
clean implication that there's one
source and and it just falls right out
of the mathematics. There's again no
handwave and that that one ma
mathematical structure actually if it
you know and again I haven't proven it
but if it does give us manowsky space
and curve space time and so forth the
borne rule and these things I talked
about then all of a sudden it changes
the game. Now the smart money is on.
Yeah, you and I are one. You I should
love my neighbor as myself because my
neighbor is myself just looking at me.
So whatever I do to you, I'm really
doing to myself. And now the best
science says that. The best science does
not say you're just a lump of atoms that
happens to have some consciousness and
you're competing with me for resources
and I can do whatever I want to to you
because
you're nothing. You're just a pack of
neurons.
I was good friends with Francis Crick.
He was a wonderful man. I had lot lots
of time with him and and enjoyed talking
with him. But in his book, you know, um,
the astonishing hypothesis says you're
nothing but a pack of neurons. And, and
of course, he was a gentleman. He didn't
treat people as a pack of neurons. But,
but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but,
but, but, but a science that says you're
just a pack of neurons will lead a lot
of people to have
more exploitative ways of
>> Yeah, it can lead them. And again, I'm
not saying that Francis was that way, of
course. Of course. Or any or any of
these any of my colleagues. So my
colleagues are wonderful people. They're
brilliant, hardworking and
moral and and and so forth. They're
they're they're wonder. But I'm just
saying that what does the philosophy
itself
entail?
Um they've risen above the philosophy
that physicalism entails.
But with if now all of a sudden the new
miracles are coming really from a theory
beyond spacetime. If we can actually get
new technology outside of spaceime and a
theory that actually works outside of
spaceime, then all of a sudden it's no
longer just some airfairyical stuff to
say,
>> yeah,
>> you're all one. It's it's it's now the
burden of proof is on the person who
wants to say, "No, we're not all one."
Can you speculate then what would be
some of the most
impactful innovations from discoveries
outside of spaceime?
Uh it seems like in so many ways they're
taking stuff straight out of sci-fi
films. It it yeah it blows my mind what
what the possibilities are. But the one
way to think about it I uh is to again
think about the Grand Theft Auto um
example and suppose you're a wizard at
Grand Theft Auto. you've done it for
years and you're the best in the world,
you can drive your car faster than
anybody, you can do all the tricks
inside the game, that's quite an
accomplishment. But if I'm the geek who
wrote the code for Grand Theft Auto,
I'm not stuck inside the rules of Grand
Theft Auto. I make the rules of Grand
Theft Auto and I can play with them and
I can take the gas tank of the wizard
and empty it. I can give him a flat tire
or I can make his car move from point A
to point B without going through the
space. I can just transport it not
through space but effectively around the
space. I can do miracles
visa v the person inside Grand Theft
Auto. What I can do is miraculous
because I'm not inside Grand Theft Auto
space. I'm creating it. So if as soon as
we're not inside spaceime the
technologies if once we understand how
to work with technologies outside of
spaceime it's like being able to write
the code of Grand Theft Auto outside of
Grand Theft Auto. Anything's possible.
Literally, all the technology that we
have now is trivial. Absolutely trivial
compared to what we can do. What you can
do inside Grand Theft Auto is trivial
compared to what the the hacker can do
who's writing the code. Would you would
you list a few? Sure.
One one thing is
the Andromeda galaxy. Our nearest galaxy
is like 2.3 or four million lighty years
away.
That's our nearest galaxy and there are
billions of galaxies at least billions
of galaxies. So getting there is a bit
of a problem. Getting to our nearest
neighbor is a bit of a problem going
through space.
>> Yeah. But you have to abide by the speed
limit.
>> Yeah. Yeah. You can only go the speed of
light and so it's and if you're massive
and hopefully we we will retain our
mass. We can't go the speed of light.
So, as long as you want to have a body,
you cannot go the speed of light. And
and and so, um,
even your great great great great
grandkids, you put them on the ship,
they're not going to get there in time.
And that's our nearest galaxy. So,
there's this whole
46 billion lighty years across that we
can see or 90 92 if you look both
directions or something. some massive
thing billions of light years across and
we can't get to the one that's only, you
know, 2.3 million lighty years away, you
know, much less the tens of billions.
So,
but if spacetime is the final reality,
then we're stuck. We have to go through
spaceime and oh boy, we'll just have to
go faster and and have great great
grandkids. But if spaceime is just a
headset and we learn the software, we
can just move ourselves from here to
there, just like the person in the geek
can take the Grand Theft Auto car and
say, "It's no longer at uh Lincoln and
and Fifth Street, it's now over here in
23rd Street and so forth and just give
them the new coordinates and and there
you are in in the in the new location.
So we will be able to have technologies
that are indistinguishable from magic."
Interstellar travel. What else?
>> Good question. I I've been so busy with
>> It's fun to speculate.
>> Yeah, just let's let's let me see what
other technologies
um because you can see my my focus has
been more on
the the technology itself.
>> One step at a time,
>> but but that one was obvious. The the
Andromeda galaxy thing
>> was obvious.
Well,
well, we may be able to warp spaceime
itself
once we time travel.
Yeah, because time itself is is merely a
a projection.
>> Seems like you could bend reality at
your will. In many ways
>> you you will be able to but not in the
way that most people would think where
if I just focus and concentrate hard
enough I can change it. This this will
this will be technology. This will be
but it's going to be an interesting kind
of technology.
So here's here's here's the trick about
it.
The only tools we have are in spacetime,
right?
So we have to understand how those tools
are related to the structures outside of
spaceime
and that's why I'm working on on the
mathematics of that. We have to reverse
engineer our headset in great detail. So
for example,
cognitive neuroscience is the study of
the brain and most of us have in my
field have thought of the brain as
creating consciousness and it doesn't.
But I still think we need more money for
cognitive neuroscience because what we
have to do is reverse engineer the brain
and ask what is the nature of this
conscious agent dynamics outside of
spaceime that projects into what we call
neurons and neural activity synapses and
so forth because that's how our headset
is being created. So once we understand
cognitive neuroscience better and
understand how to pull it back to the
dynamics of conscious agents and the
trace logic outside of spaceime. So so
we're really understanding the details
of our trace.
What is our trace that's giving us this
space-time headset?
Then we'll be in a position to say okay
what tools within the because right now
all I can do is use tools inside this
trace. Now, I haven't thought about
that. Is there is there any way for me
to get tools outside the trace? That I
don't know. I'll have to think about
that. Maybe. But but certainly we can
use tools inside the trace. But we'd
have to know exactly how those tools get
pulled back into operations behind
spacetime in the conscious agent. And
once we understand that, then we'll be
able to manipulate things.
You know, it depend on how crude that
mapping is because it may we may be
precluded from doing too much in the in
the world behind spacetime if our tools
in the pullback are too crude. But my
guess is that there'll be even if they
are crude, there'll be some new magic
that we can do anyway. But but then
there's the question of can we directly
start to access tools
not through our headset and some
spiritual traditions have talked about
that kind of thing where you
>> you aren't limited by the space-time
headset.
I and I'm I'm not I'm not writing
anything away, but but I'm saying right
now those things are are on the schm
mystical side of things where
it doesn't mean they're not true. It
just means that if they're true,
>> they're not made rigorous enough yet for
for someone hard-nosed like me.
>> Yeah.
>> But they may be true, and I would want a
hard-nosed way of saying that they work
and why they work. Um
>> I mean again spec through speculation
but if it is technically possible and we
get there one day whoever would be the
pioneer and therefore have controller
ownership
>> first would essentially have the
capacity to play God and that raises so
many moral questions and power
imbalances and uh
>> I know it's further down the line and
it's not here yet but if that is the
case and these technologies are birthed
um who whatever individual organization
country has access to such technology
first. I mean that would just completely
change the hierarchy of
>> completely. What what I would
hope maybe even expect is that someone
who really understands this theory
of consciousness
well enough to be able to do that
technology would deeply grasp
its implication that what you do to
others is literally what you're doing to
yourself. Not figuratively, not not some
platitude. You are literally when you
torture that person, you are literally
torturing torturing yourself.
If they really grasp that,
then I think they'll be careful at how
they open Pandora's box.
>> It's a good wish. It's a good wish. And
>> but your but your point is well taken.
I'm not dismissing your point at all.
It's well taken.
>> No, it's just a thought, I think. No,
it's it's a good it's an important
thought.
>> Mhm.
>> What other what other thoughts around
when you look at the Fermy paradox?
>> Yeah.
>> And you look at how big and vast this
universe is with seemingly no observable
life. Why is it so silent out there? If
there is potentially
probabilistically so many more
inhabitable planets with similar
conditions to Earth, yet we cannot pick
up
signs of alien life.
>> Right. I'm just curious your thought
process around how alien life could very
much so be operating through different
rule sets or a different headset in
which would explain why we cannot in
this third dimension interact or seem to
pick up them to the same degree we would
we would uh originally think. Um, so I'm
curious what your thoughts are on are
there if there are potential alien life
out there in the universe which would be
more probable than not uh that might be
very well operating within a different
headset of sorts, different dimension if
you will. That's right. And it's been a
bit of a puzzle as you mentioned the
permy fermy paradox that it's a huge
universe billions of light years across.
Um
if there's life out there why haven't we
seen it? What what what's going on here?
And right now there are no
uncontroversial
bits of evidence that of of life
anywhere else except here on Earth. So,
it's it's quite an interesting paradox.
And I mean, there's a a great book by
Sarah Mari Walker. She's worked with Lee
Cronin and others on on assembly theory
of of life. Um, very very interesting
theory. And I've had the pleasure of
talking with Lee and on a podcast and
discussing it with them.
And they they have have a a nice
interesting model of life where it's it
you have um the assembly index for
objects and the more complicated the
more steps minimum steps required to
build an object the greater its assembly
index. And if you have multiple copies
of a object with high assembly index,
then they suggest that that's that's
indic indicative of some higher
information processing system of life.
And so it's an interesting
theory, but it's still inside spaceime.
And
even if it's if you try to expand it
outside of spaceime, it's still a more
computational kind of model of life, an
information processing kind of model of
of life.
So
my my framework is different from from
from that. And I'm saying that life
itself is fundamental. There's no
inanimate information process that gives
rise rise to it.
So it doesn't emerge from
information processing of inanimate
systems that life itself consciousness
is is is fundamental. So then your
question becomes even stronger the you
know well okay if life is fundamental
why don't we see it man just here on
earth that's that's very very strange.
So how can isn't this isn't the firmy
par paradox really good evidence for the
physicalist point of view. Look it was
all just matter from the beginning.
We're just lucky on this one planet that
that matter got complicated enough that
life and consciousness emerged. So get
rid of your consciousness first
theories. The very lack of life and
consciousness elsewhere shows that the
physicalism is really the way of
thinking about things. And and so I turn
that around and say look
life is all around us. consciousness is
is fundamental. We have a headset that
gives us 0% of that reality. It's so
the the headset is losing all this
information. So So the aliens, where are
they? You know, they're all around you.
They're screened off by your headset.
What we what you can see are other
people. You can see organisms and worms
and so forth. You can see live and
bacteria and so forth. Um, but when I
look at a rock, most of us say, "Well,
when you look at a rock, um, you're
interacting with something that's
fundamentally inanimate. It's not not
living at all." And I say, "Not at all.
You're interacting with a consciousness,
the same consciousness that that you
are, but your headset has given up. Your
headset
says, "Look, I I'm not telling you all
reality. I'm telling you 0% of reality.
And all I'm going to tell you now is I'm
telling you about a rock. Behind that
rock there's an infinitely complicated
consciousness of course living. So life
is there as well. So there is no
principle distinction between living and
non-living things. That's not a
principal distinction. And
people who've been working on the
problem of life have been trying to give
a definition. What is the principal
distinction between living and
non-living? And haven't been able to do
it. And again, they're brilliant. The
reason they can't do it is because it's
the wrong problem. The problem is your
headset
is screening off life. It can't deal
with the profoundity of life. And so it
desiccates it. Literally desiccates life
into inanimate what we call inanimate ma
matter. But behind that inanimate
matter, if you could take off the
headset, there's
life and consciousness that would blow
you away. So where are they? They're all
around you. Just take off your headset.
Actually, it it makes a lot more sense
when you look at things like the Firmeny
paradox and you're trying to
find out why there isn't as much life
bursting out there in the universe to
the degree we would would assume. Um but
when you look at it from the lens of the
limitations of our own headset then you
could see oh okay it's just we we have a
very limited scope on on what we can
perceive through as life you know in the
cosmos.
>> Absolutely. And you know we we've always
been told to be humble and and we always
feel like well maybe I should be humble
but of course I that's just me trying to
be good.
But when you look at life through this
lens, for example, with trace logic, and
you realize that you know 0% of reality,
then then it's no longer just sort of
like a good idea to be humble. It's sort
of like it's in your face. If you're not
humble, you're just flat stupid. So So
humility is just being intelligent and
and being proud and arrogant is is is is
being really dumb.
>> Yeah. It's really stupid. So, so if you
think you've got the theory of
everything and we're that close to, you
know, we're just a little bit more past
the standard model, then it's easy to be
arrogant because we're we're close to to
to knowing everything. But when you
realize
even if you get that next step past the
standard model, you know 0% of reality.
Why is that good news? That there would
be no final theory of everything. That
reality itself will always transcend any
theory we have of it. Why is that good
news? Because you'll never be bored.
You'll never be bored. Because from this
point of this bigger point of view, you
are the one, the source.
And
there's literally no end of exploration
of who you are and who your neighbor is.
So your your neighbor and and even that
little worm is a window.
An aphid, a bacterium are all windows.
Even just a rock are windows on infinite
exploration. So imagine a world in which
at some point you'll know everything.
That's a pretty boring world. Now now I
know it all that
that's all it was. That's that. Well, I
think that's not the world we're in.
We're in a world in which
there's infinite exploration and the
exploration is you. You are.
But you transcend any scientific
exploration.
I'm a scientist. So when I say that, I'm
not saying don't do science. I spend my
life doing science. I'm all for science.
But I'm all for doing it very humbly and
saying
I'm here learning 0% of myself, but it's
a true representation as true as I can
of this perspective on myself. But this
is just one of countless perspectives.
And when I die, I take this headset off
and it's time for a different
perspective.
So, so and all the time I'm seeing all
the different I mean these beautiful
plants a different headset
>> perspective uh on the on the one
consciousness. So that it's great
because there's never going to be
boredom. There's infinite exploration
and a lot of the exploration will be
done as the mystical traditions have
said in silence. So I think that there's
and I do this now myself in in my own
scientific
um research. Of course you do your
mathematics, you do your you study hard,
no nonsense, no BS. But then if I want
new creative ideas, I put it all aside
and just sit in silence. And that
silence itself is tapping into this
infinite wisdom that everybody is. I
think breeds reverence back into the
human experience where from the purely
reductionistic lens not that everybody
embodies that
>> uh the perspective of
>> if it's all just bound a bundle of atoms
really
the the best thing that you could do is
extract the most of it. You know you
could use it to your benefit how you
will. there's no inherent moral value or
effect uh uh externally in that in that
aspect.
>> But from this perspective when you flip
it on its head in this chain of
causality
I am reminded of Thomas Barry's quote
that the universe is a communion of
subjects not a collection of objects.
>> Yes. Very very good.
>> And the vidantic lens of Indrris net are
you familiar with that imagery? Yeah. it
to me when you explain the trace logic
and marovian chain like if it it maps on
perfectly with it almost because there
is this wide net and within each jewel
is reflected the the the others within
it and so it it brings the coherence and
and connection of all life into that
into that image. I'm curious your
thoughts there because it seems so
consilient.
>> I I I I agree on both both points.
First, your point about that being a
physicist doesn't necessarily mean that
you're immoral. In fact, I have many
many good physicalist friends and and
they're wonderful people and I trust
them completely with my life and my kids
and and so forth. So, I'm I'm not so I'm
not not saying that. I'm just saying as
you said that these philosophies tend to
have logical conclusions that move in in
different directions. But I I agree with
your point also about Indra's net that
there's something very very
similar in spirit and and so this could
be you know the the trace logic could be
a first mathematical
statement of indet and and and in saying
that I would say not that it completely
exhausts what the idea of indet but it's
the first precise mathematical statement
that we could give in maybe indet is
pointing to something even deeper.
Right? Maybe the trace logic is just the
first baby step we're taking outside of
spaceime and and we will find hopefully
much much deeper structures
um and and and maybe thousands and
thousands of iterations of that
all at some point you know exploring the
metaphor of of Indra's net more and more
precisely deeper levels. I I maybe an
inexhaustible
um direction to explore. And so I don't
want to say, "Yeah, I done it with the
trace logic." I would say, "No, maybe
I've taken the first scientific baby
step in that direction." And hey, we
took a baby step in that direction. And
let's let's first nail this one down.
Let's really
get the math completely secure on this.
So we So every step outside our previous
series has to be really secure. Once we
got that nailed down, then let's look
outside the limits of the the trace
logic. Okay, that was fun. Now, let's go
on to the next thing. What what's And
maybe the end net will still be a guide.
Maybe it won't, but maybe it will be a
guide to the next deeper step.
To me, this has so many far-reaching
implications on what it means to be a
human. What is life? What is death?
How does this to you change
what death is? If there is no clear
demarcation of a boundary between life
and death as we were speaking to
earlier,
>> and death is then merely taking off of
the headset. Um, yeah. What What does
that change? What's your perspective on
that?
>> Well, first I don't want to sound like
more spiritual than I am. Someone put a
gun to my head, I'd be afraid. I'd
probably wet my pants. So, so I'll just
put that on the table right away. So,
anything that I say after this that
sounds like I'm super spiritual, I'll
just put that right on the table. Okay.
So, but now I'll try to think out of the
box. Death from this this framework
um conscious agents and the trace logic
is merely taking off a headset. And
there's an infinite number of headsets.
And
in some sense, the whole point of being
here is just to look at myself from this
perspective.
Nothing that I build here is going to
last.
If I build an empire worth a trillion
dollars,
I'm going to walk away from it. Whether
I like like it or not, I'm going to walk
away from it. Everything every any book
I write is going to burn or be
destroyed. anything. So nothing you do
here lasts. So it's not about making
some physical structure that's going to
last forever because it's not.
So what is it about? It's not about
being important.
Who was the most important person in
1753?
Couldn't care less. Who cares who was
the richest person in 1844? I don't
care. No one cares. No one's going to
care. It's not important. So what what
is this all about? Because nothing that
nothing that you build lasts.
No one that you love is going to live
forever
from this from in this framework. It was
really not about
living here forever in this little
headset. It was enjoying this view of
myself from this headset, learning about
myself and not being attached to this.
This is just one view. This is not me.
This is a really a really interesting
view of me. Wow, this is really neat.
You know, going to work, doing a job,
cooking food, having kids, meeting
people, doing podcasts. Interesting
perspective on myself. And I'm going to
walk away from all this and none of it
will go with me. I'm I just leave it
behind. But that was a perspective on
myself.
And
there's an infinite number of these the
once I learn to get with the pro not to
be afraid not to cling to what I already
know. If I can just learn to enjoy the
ride.
This actually gets to the minimizing
surprise stuff. So the trace logic
actually is is a little bit about this.
Here I am in a particular trace.
One way to think about growing up in
this framework is moving to a bigger
trace, right? Expanding my horizon, move
move to a bigger trace. Well, when you
do that, if I'm on a little trace and
I'm going to expand to a bigger trace,
all of my transition probabilities, all
the probabilities of, you know, if if
I'm seeing red now, what's the
probability I'll see green? Or if I do
this with my cup now, what's the
probability that it'll fall? Those
probabilities are all going to change.
So, growing up means
not resisting
the unexpected
because the transition probabilities are
different on the join on the bigger
space. Your your minimal surprise model
worked for your conscious states. It
doesn't work if you want to expand your
consciousness. You have to change all of
your transition probabilities to be a
new consciousness in the new domain.
That means you have to be willing to not
resist surprise. You have to be willing
to so when the spiritual traditions say
you must accept what is. That's that's
the key. That is the step in spiritual
growth. Accept what is. That turns out
the trace logic completely agrees
to go from where I am to the next bigger
next bigger step of join. I have to not
resist
all the changes in the probabilities
that are required for the new join.
That's what it means to be at the new
joint. And then once again as I go even
bigger I will have to not resist those.
So what the trace logic is saying is it
actually again I it either works or it
doesn't. I I'm not smart enough to make
this stuff up. I mean, I just saw the
trace logic, so it probably isn't true.
And and so it's not me. It's just really
just the trace logic itself is so
amazing.
It basically says what the spiritual
traditions have been saying, and that is
at every step, if you want to grow,
don't resist
surprise.
It makes me think about how the species
that survives is not the smartest or
strongest, but the most adaptable, the
one that is uh has the capacity to be
flexible and and change with the
uncertainty of times. And um
there is a great in the Buddhist
tradition sort of understanding of
the yard stick for your own degree of
growth is essentially your equinimity
throughout the everchanging impermanent
phenomena arising and passing away. and
na this impermanent flow of experience
that we're always um moving through in
life and our ability to not stay
attached to one experience positive or
negative.
>> Yes.
>> As uh like that's that's a that's a real
growth as a human being. I I I
completely agree and and in some sense
the the trace logic itself is just the
logic of the experiences but the the
measurable space behind it is what
you're pointing to and the spiritual
traditions are pointing to that is the
the real deep you and
that doesn't get changed or affected by
all the play of experiences. So so that
equinimity makes sense in this trace
logic framework. actually it doesn't in
the physicalist framework. In the
physicalist framework um your life hangs
by a thread
and if something goes wrong with your
body it's extinguished. So you need to
do everything you can to try to stay as
long as alive as because otherwise your
consciousness is extinguished and that's
completely game over for you. This other
framework says no
your consciousness is secure.
The play of forms is just a headset that
you're trying on and you have you you
are so deep and infinite that you can
play with an infinite number of headsets
and and never ex you know completely
explore your who you are. So, so there's
no reason to be afraid.
But within the headset, it was is
interesting though, I guess, putting on
a headset for the for the source to put
on the headset.
It goes in with both feet.
Let me I'm not just going to sort of put
on this headset. I'm going to put on
this headset.
>> Fully assume the role of a separate
self.
>> That's that's that's right. I'm going to
I'm going to really go in and I'm going
to be afraid. I'm gonna let my and I'm
gonna have dramas
and I'm gonna murder myself. In other
I'm gonna really go into this whole
thing and and experience the whole
thing.
Otherwise, it's not really looking
myself completely from that perspective.
So, it seems to be that as well that
that you really do look at yourself from
that perspective and you go all in. So
much so that you lose for a while who
you are and then you have to wake up to
who you are. And that's why if you put a
gun to me, I would pee in my pants
because I haven't completely awakened to
who I am, right? I
I can see now, but
the
process of really integrating that in
and understanding who I am as the one is
still a process that I'm going through.
And for me, having this mathematics is a
help.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. To me, it brings a lot of
gratitude for the contrast of the good
and bad things that we perceive in our
life. You know, I just think of on the
macro scale of like the most grotesque
assassinations and uh calamities that
are happening in the planet in contrast
with the most beautiful grace and
devotional love and outpouring and um
like the the full contrast of what's
available within human experience is
quite astounding. And when it comes to
our own personal life and our own
personal struggles and different things,
I think it brings some gratitude in the
picture that we get to have the
experience of many different versions
and different feelings and emotions and
what they all uniquely reveal about who
we are and our true essence.
>> Yes.
>> Um, and I know this is something that
you've personally also been on in your
own health journey with long co with
your with your with your heart.
I'm curious what has come up for you on
the human emotional because there's of
course the logical side where you can
see and and phil you know philosophize
about a lot of these different things.
Um but what when it comes to approaching
your own human insecurity you know and
not just what a potential you know death
or disease would mean for the people
that love you but also the urgency of
your work and the imminent discoveries
that are coming to bear fruit. I'm just
curious how is how have you navigated
your own process around around the
uncertainties of your health and the
whole process? Well, it certainly has
put um my assumptions that I'm just a
space-time physical object right in
front of my face. And I can see that,
you know, the fears that I have um of
death, you know, going to an operation
for my I have had two heart surgeries
and I've had my heart started restarted
with a electric shock five times and so
forth since co it's been it's been
not uh the way I had anticipated the
last 5 years to be. Um but CO completely
changed the game and it put my mortality
front and center. I mean, I I think I
mentioned last time I texted my wife
goodbye um one in the hospital one time.
So, it it certainly has um I've had the
headset removal right in my face a few
times and and the headset's going to be
removed.
Um, and there's nothing like having it
almost removed
number of times in the last 5 years to
um, have it not just be an abstract
possibility, but but an in-your-face
reality and to see how I feel about it
and to see see the the fears that are
there and um, to f I mean, of course,
this is complete fact and I would have,
you know, even 5 years ago said, "Yeah,
of course I'm going to die." But but not
now. Not now. Maybe in 40 years or
something like that, but not not now.
And I can sort of you can sort of ignore
it and put it away. But when you're on
the in the hospital and you're texting
your wife goodbye, it's no longer, you
know, an abstract possibility. So, it's
it I think it's helped me in
looking outside of spacetime more and
and
but I then still see myself getting my
sense of importance or who I am by what
I might accomplish, what I might
discover. And so I have to look at that
and go okay to the extent that I get my
sense of who I am by what I might
discover and how important that might
be. Then to that extent that I still
don't really know who I am because who I
am is infinitely greater than that. So,
if I'm still looking to to to
be important in some way, then then I
don't realize who I am and and and who
you are that
I I like watching these videos um um by
some Canadians called Just for Laughs
Gags
>> and they they put people in all these
unusual situations and they and they're
they all take them very very seriously.
all they're worried or they're and then
all of a sudden they find it's a gag and
and you see the at the end people start
laughing and belly and they and and it's
and I and I watch them all the time it
it helps to laugh and so forth is really
good for you but it's also what life is
like we're taking it all seriously and
and so forth but take the headset off
and laugh and and that's what happens in
these gags. you you you're you're taking
it all seriously. Uh and and then all of
a sudden you find out the whole thing
was a gag and then you and you just have
then people have a good belly laugh
about it. And so there's that aspect
about do your best while you're in the
headset. Um but don't take yourself too
seriously. Um the egoic self too
seriously. But the thing to take
seriously very seriously is that you are
the source that's infinite but so is
your neighbor is this your source that's
infinite and you know
this think about this in in the context
of death this is one big importance
symbol from Christianity
right the deepest symbol in Christianity
is Jesus on the cross being tortured to
death in the most cruel way that people
could imagine and having it hours the
most utter cruel pain. And what did he
say while he was in the process of
watching the people who were hatefully
killing him in the worst way that they
could come up with?
He said, "Forgive them. They don't know
what they're doing."
That's the deepest spiritual thing I've
ever heard right there. And that, you
know, that is the centerpiece of
Christianity and I think of all true
religion is to to have that attitude
even in the face of people who are doing
that to you. Now, I'm not saying I'm
anywhere near Jesus. No, if I was on the
cross there, I'm I'm sure I'd be pissed
off and I'd be But I'm I'm saying that
that's where my own theory says I should
go to that transcendent way of being
>> that that trans but Hoffman's emotions
are not there. My mind is saying here's
the theory that's going to take me
there. I have a lot of spiritual growing
up to do and all of us do. But that's
where the deep part of Christianity and
any true religion. It's not in killing
the unbelievers,
being angry with people that disagree
with you.
It's forgiving them in the very moment
in which they're hurting you.
And if we do that,
our country will be a very different
kind of country.
It's a different level of compassion
when you hold the awareness of actions
that are coming from a place of
unconsciousness or unawareness where
it's really hurting the person doing it
as well. Of course, as well as other
people that it's hurting in the external
world. But you can have compassion for
seeing people as phenomenas unto
themselves. You know, like if you see
somebody who does a horrific thing and
hurts a lot of people, but then you come
to find out they have a brain tumor
pressing on their amydala, it puts a
different context into the picture of,
okay, I can have a bit more compassion
for
>> it wasn't full there wasn't full agency
there. I just think that it's
fascinating that you can extrapolate
that all the way down that there are
many different forces within us that we
would not say that are consciously
chosen but for the circumstances we were
raised in or whatever. Like you know
people need to be held responsible for
their actions and still uh we get to
have a have more compassion for
all of the experiences that led them to
the point in which they would do those
things. I I completely agree and and and
and again Jesus on this was very very
clear in I think Matthew chapter 7 in
the sermon on the mount he says flat out
judge not period
don't judge any he couldn't be clear
there was no exceptions he just said
don't judge other people period and then
he said but and he he also didn't say
judge yourself he said notice he just
said notice the speck that's in your eye
don't judge the other person for the the
they say that the just notice the log
that's in your own eye, but don't judge
the your brother or your sister for the
speck that's in in their eye. So it it
that is the heart of Christianity.
Anything
that involves hatred of the
disbelievers, judging of other people is
absolutely not
Christ. Absolutely not. Christ is
absolutely no judgment. complete
compassion, complete love for your
enemies. Love your enemies. Um, love
anybody who's needy. That's that's the
heart and and soul and the deep thing is
what we've been talking about earlier.
When you love your neighbor, you are
loving yourself. That's the the deep
deep thing. When you don't judge someone
else, you're not judging yourself.
Do you notice the spec Jesus said notice
the log in your own eye? But he didn't
say judge yourself for it. He just said
notice it. And that's only as soon as
you notice it, you're not you're no
longer stuck in it. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
I'm afraid. Oh yeah, I was mistreating
that person. Oh, I was judging that
person. So I'm not going to judge myself
because I was judging you. I'm going to
just notice. And that's, you know, I
wanted to kill all those people because
they oh well that's, you know, okay, I'm
not going to beat myself up. Okay, I'm
just going to Okay, I noticed I was very
angry. I wanted to beat you. Okay,
is Jesus mad at me? No, he said he he
wasn't mad at the people who were
killing him. So, he's not mad at me.
It's a very very different place. And
the only way it makes sense is to
realize that everybody is the source
seen from a different perspective.
That's the only way it makes sense. And
I think for some of us having the
intellectual comprehension of that is is
is supportive. And then for many you
know the taste or the experience of that
being so and through meditative
contemplative practices move the needle
more uh we can take it where we get it
you know all of it's welcome.
>> Absolutely. And someone who's who's you
know a slow learner like me has to do
both.
>> I'm I'm right there with you
Don. I am always so fulfilled by the
conversation that we get to have and
it's such a honor honestly to be able to
have this discussion, explore the
emerging discoveries you're when you get
fired up about all of it. Um, and then
all the implications for how it changes
when we leave these chairs and when
people turn off this podcast to move
through life with a bit more empathy,
with a bit more understanding, with a
bit more awe and curiosity. And uh, I
think that's a great thing. It was a
great pleasure. Thank you very much,
Andre.
>> Yeah. Is there anywhere you want to
point people to uh any last
uh things that are coming out or Yeah.
just where do you want to point people
towards if they want to get more
familiar with you, your work? Well, my
book um the case against reality is more
about the evolutionary side. There's a
little chapter about consciousness being
fundamental at at the at the very end.
And I'm working on a paper on the trace
logic that will be publishing a couple
papers on it. One mathematical and and
so forth. So there's nothing yet on the
trace logic that people can read. So
this is like my first time I've really
been
>> this deep in public with with the trace
logic, but um
there I'm hoping within a couple months
there there will be something out there
that I can I can give to you and you can
if you want to send it to your audience.
um sweet
>> public publication. So, this is actually
earlier even before my publications are
out on it. So,
>> no, I'm I feel very grateful to get
early access to some of the papers and
things that you're sharing. It's it's so
fascinating.
Thank you. Thank you everybody for
tuning in to this episode of the Know
Thyself podcast. Let us know in which
ways this was impactful to you and I'll
see you next time. Thanks, Don. Thank
you.
