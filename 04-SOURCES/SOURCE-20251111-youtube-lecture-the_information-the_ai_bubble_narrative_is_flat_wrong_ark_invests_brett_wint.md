# The AI Bubble Narrative Is "Flat Wrong" | ARK Invest’s Brett Winton

## Description (no transcript available)

Many investors see the AI trade as a bubble, but ARK Invest's Chief Futurist Brett Winton strongly disagrees. He explains why productivity gains delivered by tools like ChatGPT are set to "triple over the course of this year and then triple again", leading to a compound increase in pricing power of 40 to 50 times. Winton argues that current revenue projections are "conservative relative to the pricing power that they have" and justifies the massive data center CapEx spending we see today.

Brett also dives into Tesla’s humanoid robots and robotaxis as well as provides a contrarian take that Wall Street "underestimates how valuable cures are" because they prefer recurring revenue.
