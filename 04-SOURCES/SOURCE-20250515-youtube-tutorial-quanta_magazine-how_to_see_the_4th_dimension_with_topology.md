# How to 'See' the 4th Dimension with Topology

**Channel**: Quanta Magazine
**Published**: 2025-05-15
**Duration**: 12m 36s

## Description (no transcript available)

Mathematician Maggie Miller explores the strange and fascinating world of 4D topology — the study of shapes, or manifolds, that resemble flat Euclidean space when viewed up close. Four-dimensional manifolds behave in unexpectedly complex ways, pushing mathematicians to develop advanced techniques to understand them.

Maggie Miller is an assistant professor in the mathematics department at the University of Texas at Austin. She was also a former Visiting Clay Fellow and Stanford Science Fellow.
