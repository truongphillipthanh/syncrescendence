## Description (no transcript available)

Nuclear war has started---and ended. Your government has just been destroyed. But you still control 16 nuclear-tipped missiles. What is your next step? If you are a commander of a British submarine, you do not have to think through an answer. One is provided inside of a safe aboard your submarine. It is called a "letter of last resort," to be opened only under such circumstances.

I sat down with Nathaniel Davis, an assistant professor and vice dean at the Army War College about an exercise he does with his students to write their own letters. We first discussed the mission of the Army War College before transitioning to the letters of last resort, and later the movie House of Dynamite.
