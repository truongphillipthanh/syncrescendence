# Solana, Crypto-AI Convergence, and Machine-to-Machine Economics

## Executive Summary
Anatoly Yakovenko (Solana co-founder) presents a vision of crypto-AI convergence where AI agents are the primary users of blockchains. As intelligence becomes cheaper, more markets become viable—"the ants are not aware of the intelligence of the anthill." Solana differentiates from Bitcoin (store of value) and Ethereum (settlement) as an "execution" layer handling 65K TPS today, targeting millions. AI agents need permissionless transaction ability; blockchains provide this. The explosion of economic activity from 24/7 AI agents will dwarf human transactions.

## Key Insights

### Bitcoin/Ethereum/Solana Trifecta
- **Bitcoin**: Store of value (geological timescale)
- **Ethereum**: Settlement (slow, secure)
- **Solana**: Execution (real-time, cheap, composable)

"I simply wasn't interested in settlement or store of value because they're not the kind of engineering problem that I'm interested in solving."

### Proof of History Innovation
Cryptographic functions create a verifiable source of time. Nodes can independently verify time without talking to each other. This enables 400ms block times vs Bitcoin's 10 minutes.

### AI Agents as Primary Blockchain Users
AI agents need permissionless transaction ability—no bank accounts, no KYC. Once AIs start transacting on-chain, economic activity explodes. AIs operate 24/7, monitor thousands of markets, execute strategies humans can't comprehend. "The majority of transactions will be between AIs."

### Cheaper Intelligence = More Markets
As intelligence cost drops, more markets become viable. Prediction markets, decision markets (futarchy), micro-markets for every decision. "The ants are not aware of the intelligence of the anthill"—emergent market intelligence beyond individual comprehension.

### Stablecoins as Killer App
1 billion people have smartphones but no access to dollars/banking. Stablecoin legislation enabling $1-10T in digital dollars over 5 years. "Most users won't know they're using blockchain—they'll think they're using a better payment app."

### Victory State
Global commerce that works: farmer in Kenya paid in stablecoins instantly, developer in Vietnam monetizing globally without bank account, small business in Brazil accessing credit without paperwork. "Financial teleportation—moving value at the speed of light."

### Wealth Redefinition
Panel debate on future wealth:
- Salim: Time + health span
- Dave: Compute (universal foundation)
- Alex: Future freedom of action (bits of empowerment)
- Peter: Ability to fulfill purpose (compute + nanotech)
- Anatoly: "Think in abundance, not scarcity—then time and health span are all that matter"

## Transcript

The fact that we now have stable coin
legislation and that people are
projecting like 1 trillion to 10
trillion worth of digital dollars being
minted over the next, you know, 5 years
is going to massively accelerate things.
>> Why does your company exist and second
why we need it?
>> Salana's there to really enable that 1
billion people to go fully
interconnected. [music] Bitcoin is store
value. Ethereum is settlement. Salana is
execution. I just simply wasn't
interested in settlement or store value
because they're not uh the kind of
engineering problem that I'm interested
in solving.
>> So is that the future? A single machine
layer for all markets everywhere.
>> There's no computer science academic
reason why it can't exist. It's purely
an engineering problem and we're on our
way to solve it like as fast as we can.
>> How long before this science fiction
future could come into existence? My gut
is uh uh
>> now that's a moonshot ladies and
gentlemen.
>> Hey everybody, welcome to Moonshots.
Here with my Moonshot mates Dave London.
Hey Dave.
>> Hey Alexer Gross.
>> Hey Peter.
>> Hey and Salem Ismael. And we have a
special guest today.
>> We're going to be diving into Salana.
Anatoli Yakoveno is here. software
engineer, entrepreneur, co-founder and
CEO of Sana Labs, which today is the
sixth largest coin. Uh, now worth over
hundred billion dollars. Congratulations
for that.
>> Yeah, you know, 100 billion, 100 billion
there on your way to a trillion. Uh, you
know, a bachelor's in computer science
from University of Illinois. Urbane, uh,
began your career at Qualcomm. Uh, an
amazing company, right? uh uh I had a
chance to watch their domination and uh
Salana has emerged as the leader in
decentralized finance and blockchain uh
generating what is that 2.2 billion in
annual revenues between 2024 and 25. Uh
that's extraordinary.
>> It's it's the cool one around MIT. I can
tell you that firsthand too. [laughter]
>> I'll give you some quotes later. But
yes, you are you are known and you are
cool.
>> That's awesome.
[laughter] Yeah. So, uh, uh, guys,
today, uh, I really want to hit on a few
things, which is the crypto essential,
sort of Salana 101, what makes it
different from Bitcoin and Ethereum.
Want to dive into Salana as a use of
payments, sort of the everything coin,
and then really the convergence of
crypto and AI, which is going to cause
this explosion in the global economy. Um
let me begin with a question that is on
my mind um to which is you know given
sort of our incredible rush towards AGI
every dollar in the ecosystem is being
sucked into this black hole of
computronium we're building across the
planet. So we've got AI we've got agents
we have Salana we have stable coins.
What's the future of money going to look
like? I mean do you think it's going to
be recognizable in the next 10 years?
I think um the two things that I see
converging uh is that the cost for
intelligence is dropping and markets
require intelligence and um because it's
now cheaper to have intelligence to
analyze all the signal in the world you
can now have a lot more markets and
public permissionless blockchains like
Salana allow you to create markets
permissionlessly for whatever random
thing is and you kind of saw this with
prediction markets and poly market and
kshi kind of taking But the weird kind
of cool experiments like futarchi where
you have decision markets for every
decision that a fund or a company can
take, those can now exist. And as
intellig intelligence gets cheaper, you
have more markets that are viable and
you kind of see this exponential
explosion of uh everything being decided
through market forces, which I think is
uh it's like the quote I made before the
podcast is like the ants are not aware
of the intelligence of the antill. I
can't fit all these markets in my head
or like the outcome of this, but my gut
is that uh this is probably the most
optimal direction for kind of for
society to move forward and make
decisions, the more market based it is
and the more intelligence you have to
make those decisions correctly and the
forcing function of losing money is like
a good way to to course correct when you
have bad intelligence. So hopefully it's
it's a good thing but beyond my I can't
fit it all in my head. It's beyond my
comprehension.
>> The speed of change is awesome right
now, right? I mean I I I think and and
Alex we talk about this like economy 3.0
in the future.
>> Yes. Before we started recording to and
I were were I I would say sort of
lamenting the sad case of truth terminal
the autonomous AI agent that's being
forced to mint its own meme coins just
in order to survive in this like really
harsh world for for AI agents right now.
I mean to to I I'd be curious. So in
principle, new layer 1 ones in including
Salana offer the the premise for AI
agents just to survive. Humans for the
most part were banked. We we have the
ability to to engage in a human economy.
If if you're a a a baby AI agent just
trying to find its way in this world and
you can't open a bank account, you you
can't interact as a first class citizen.
What do you do? Like what what what's
T's handbook? What what's your what's
guide for Can you tell a good joke?
[laughter]
>> Can you can you tell a good joke? Then
you can survive. I think that is the the
finalistment test for true AGI is can
you entertain a person or not even like
a complex person. Can you keep a toddler
entertained? The
>> how do you how do you economically
survive if you're a baby agi and and you
want to be autonomous?
>> Um I think yeah, memecoins is like a
weirdian beauty contest for attention.
uh could work then if can you keep
people paying attention to you by being
entertaining then you can probably pay
for the inference to do that
>> that that's the main business model that
I see right now for these poor baby AGIS
so it it's you know maybe as uh as as an
assignment to to to you the the creator
of Salana we need a better business
model for for these baby AGIs to survive
other than minting meme coins
>> Alex can you imagine an a an AGI coming
to you and say
would you please adopt me? I need a
human shield. I need a human to sort of
fend for me in the banking system
>> with a with a credit card. I need a
>> I think in some sense, Peter, like
that's the corporation model that we
have right now with with AI using
corporations as embodiment for for
themselves as economic actors.
>> Every week, my team and I study the top
10 technology metat trends that will
transform industries over the decade
ahead. I cover trends ranging from
humanoid robotics, AGI, and quantum
computing to transport, energy,
longevity, and more. There's no fluff,
only the most important stuff that
matters, that impacts our lives, our
companies, and our careers. If you want
me to share these meta trends with you,
I write a newsletter twice a week,
sending it out as a short two-minute
read via email. And if you want to
discover the most important meta trends

now back to this episode.
>> Why don't we kick ourselves off with a
little bit of the Salana vision here
because our our buddy Mike Sailor has,
you know, he's the Bitcoin promoter of
all promoters, but Bitcoin has be the
original vision of Bitcoin was as a
transactional tool. Now it's become a
store of wealth, a huge store of wealth,
but it's way too slow to be the
transactional engine of the future. And
so you're, you know, Alex's baby AI is
no way he's going to sit there at the
cash register for 20, 30, 40, you know,
years of AI time trying to buy
something. But, uh, you know, Ethereum
came after that, but now Salana, I heard
on your last podcast, a thousand times
faster than the Ethereum chain. So, it's
it's keeping up with AI basically,
right?
Yeah, that's the goal. And I think um
very very simple way to think of it is
like Bitcoin is store value, Ethereum is
settlement, Solano's execution. And I
just simply wasn't interested in
settlement or store value because
they're not uh the kind of engineering
problem that I'm interested in solving.
And execution is a very uh hard like not
I don't think it's a computer science
problem where we need theoretical
solutions. It's a it's just a fun
engineering problem like how do you move
bits as fast as possible around the
world. [snorts] Um and these this is
what I like to get my hands dirty and I
was just kind of gravitated towards
that.
>> I would I would love to hear a little
bit of this history behind the proof of
history concept that you came up with.
Totally. Um cuz I think that's such a
fascinating uh unique approach to
blockchains. Also, while we're doing
this, I'm I'm unboxing a Seeker phone
live.
>> Nice.
I have a Salana Seeker phone that I that
I got that I've been wanting to unbox
for a while. So, uh, but curious to hear
about that.
>> Yeah, it's um it's uh so first of all,
I'm not a uh researcher. I'm an
engineer. I spent most of my career at
Qualcomm. Got there right after college
in 2003 and was just really interested
in um optimizing how fast you can move
bits through memory. So, I was a
performance nerd. I would have dreams
where I have debugger windows between
different co-processors
because I would stare at them for so
many weeks like just trying to debug
problems and stuff. Um, and I was
definitely aware of Bitcoin when it came
out um and Ethereum as well and kind of
as an engineer you you often overlook
the social aspect of these things. So
you kind of look at it, oh, it's not
going to scale or not going to work, but
kind of miss the whole transformative
change that these things could provide
because they're so new and and weird.
And uh in 2017, um I was actually
working at a side project. Always had a
side project. This one was building deep
learning boxes for transformers and
mining crypto in the background because
you could pay for the GPUs this way as
off to offset the capex.
>> Oh wow.
>> And this is I was just doing this for
fun.
with a friend of mine uh another
Qualcomm nerd uh that I do side projects
with and um we I had two coffees and a
beer at Cafe Sole in San Francisco. It's
a combination that usually doesn't sit
with anyone didn't sit with me. So I was
up till 4 in the morning and we were
discussing proof of work and this idea
could we build a single threaded mining
system that was just totally different
concept and I kind of had this Eureka
moment at 4:00 a.m. that there's a way
to measure different physical constant
than anthropy uh which is what proof of
work does for civil resistance. There's
a way to actually measure passage of
time in a way that's hard to fake. And
this is a recursive cryptographic hash
function like SHA 256. You run it over
itself and you run this process and you
sample it and you get a data structure
that you can say then well it's
incredibly hard to beat TSMC by more
than a factor of two at how fast you can
make a processor. So the amount of time
that somebody took to generate this data
structure is at least X. And obviously
you can cheat and go a little faster but
you cannot go arbitrarily faster. you're
basically limited by where technology is
today. Um, and that was this Eureka
moment in my head because even though I
wasn't working at protocols at Qualcomm,
just being at a cellular protocol
company, you get you just know how the
stuff works. And one of the first
cellular protocols that anyone ever
built was called time division multiple
access.
>> Yes. TDMA. Yes.
>> Yeah. And um this actually like if you
remember your physics classes if you two
radio towers transmit over the same time
at the same frequency you get noise. So
the first thing that they gave them is a
clock to alternate and that's what how
you get TDMA. Well in in Bitcoin in
proof of work you have a similar
problem. If you if you produce a block
at the same time in two different parts
of the world you get a collision. So the
network is in this noisy state and
information is not passing through. So
the difficulty adjustment in Bitcoin is
almost very similar to how Aloha has
like a random adjustment to retransmit
in a random base radio protocol is
you're trying to prevent this collision
from occupying the same channel. So you
stretch it out to make sure the
probability of a collision is very
small. But because you're doing that
you're lowering the channel efficiency.
You can't send as many bits through it.
So as soon as I had this like, oh, I
have this clock that nobody needs to
trust as a third party provider, I can
do the same trick and maximizing the
number of bits I can shove through the
network. And my backup envelope was
like, oh, this is at least 10,000 times
faster than Bitcoin. [snorts] So that
was this kind of thing that like I built
TDMA for blockchain. So what's what's
funny is that um I don't know I was bad
at like selling the idea to venture
capital or maybe I was good enough like
but this idea that what you really the
problem that you're solving is this
channel efficiency problem like that was
hard for me to actually communicate in
those early days and I was more focused
oh this is a whole new consensus
algorithm the yada yada really focusing
on the implementation side more so than
what it unlocks and years later um now
like I think we're in what year seven
for Salana and like year 20 for crypto
in general we now see the next
generation consensus algorithms don't
actually have to depend on the clock
like proof history but do solve this
problem of channel efficiency so um we
got so successful that I was able to
hire kind of best-in-class bleeding edge
consensus team out of ETHZurich that are
throwing away proof history and all the
code that could help in the early is but
clearly understand the problem that I
solved and like this is what this is the
problem you solve this is why it's
important and why that's a good thing
but you don't actually need all this
complexity so it's now I get to see my
baby retired in a way
>> just so [clears throat] everybody knows
ETH Zurich is it's the MIT of Europe has
nothing to do with Ethereum
>> just total coincidence that it's called
ETH but nothing to do with [laughter]
Ethereum
>> that that's such a the full like
founding storytell in part I I never
made the the connection between uh TDMA
and and just in general the Qualcomm
view of of wireless and and and aiming
for high throughput. I'm I'm curious if
you were to mentally run the clock
forward. So uh although source code for
earlier versions from Solanda Lab still
preserved for posterity on on GitHub I
see but if you fast forward what does
the perfect layer 1 look like to you?
like what where do you see all of this
going if you could fast forward 10 years
15 years?
>> Yeah, I think um like what is it solving
right? So I think if you're solving
execution what you're trying to do is
have as many markets around the world
synchronized as much as possible and
there's several challenges there and one
is uh you look at like something like
NASDAQ or NIS it's a centralized piece
of memory like literally it exists in a
single physical location so um
and that seems like the fastest way to
build something you can build sub
microcond matching engine and like run
really really fast markets there but The
problem that it has is that if you have
like an event in Singapore where like a
container ship full of iPhone sinks
outside your window, that information
still has to go speedy through fiber
from Singapore to New York before it's
it it's in the market. Yeah. So, uh,
perfect layer 1 is something that can do
both. And the way that we envision it at
Salana is you actually have concurrent
block producers that are making blocks
at the same time. one in Singapore, one
in New York. So your latency to the
block producer is as short as possible
and they're located to where all the
signal is like in the most important
markets. You have concurrently ingesting
transactions and your latency to stick
this data into the chain so markets can
now take action on it is as low as
possible. So this is kind of the
communication physics problem. And this
is again the analogy that's kind of dumb
but works is you're going from TDMA to
CDMMA. We have concurrent channels you
can simultaneously use at the same time.
Um, and you can shove all this
information into this single giant state
machine that is churning through it as
fast as we can synchronize around the
world.
>> So, is that the future? A single uh
machine layer for all markets
everywhere.
>> Yes.
>> That everything is living on top of.
>> If you imagine science fiction finance
20, 50 years from now, that's what it
looks like. And this is where there's no
computer science academic reason why it
can't exist. It's purely an engineering
problem and we're on our way to solve it
like as fast as we can.
>> Totally. If you could walk us through
concretely like what is it in your mind
what does that future look like? Does it
look like e every every object
everywhere where we talk on the pod all
the time about tiling the earth with
data centers and and with [laughter]
>> No, you you you talk.
>> Okay.
>> We just we agree. We agree. [laughter]
>> Okay.
first person singular. I I talk all the
time about tiling the earth with with
compute. But in your mind, does does
this does this vision concretely involve
basically embedding like Shaw or like
hash function proof of history
generation in every object everywhere?
>> No, you no, you don't need you don't
need any of that. um with just kind of
the next generation Byzantine full
tolerant consensus like Alpenlow there's
or there's a bunch of other options but
um you can just have concurrent nodes
that are ingesting signal anywhere in
the world where there's valuable signal
and what's kind of interesting for a
proof ofstake network people will move
stake to those places so they can run
those block producers more often and
therefore be the pro the center that
ingests that signal into the chain And
that's the most profitable part you can
do because the way that these networks,
proof ofstake networks make money is you
have markets on chain. There is value at
risk in those markets. And the faster
you get data to adjust those markets,
the the faster you can make money,
right? Like your cost of opportunity to
being late, to being second to take that
trade is effectively the entire profit
of that trade. So you're now
incentivized to go and start
colllocating next to the signal whether
that's Singapore, London, New York, LA
or whatever, or in the future, who knows
where. You can move the block production
next to where that signal is produced
that impacts markets. You ingest the
data as fast as you can into the single
global data structure. And it's actually
not that big because markets themselves
and trades and all this other stuff,
they're not eight five, you know, uh,
you know, 4K video streamed in real time
driving in China to a person in LA
driving, right? This is what Qualcomm
built is mind-blowingly complex, low
latency, high throughput stuff. Markets
and trades and all and all these other
things are actually relatively small
amount of memory and small amount of
messages in comparison. So the yeah
[snorts] the NFL is building all the
infra for us like that. [laughter]
>> How long before this science fiction
future could come into existence and is
there a tipping point at which point
when enough people are on that player on
that on that platform on that layer it
makes you know it doesn't make sense for
NASDAQ not to be there it doesn't make
sense for everything else not to be
there. Yeah, I think you'll still have
very localized markets because there is
advantages to being colloccated and
having that like lite cone around micro
structure and like the cues.
>> There are people talking about lite
cones. That's great.
>> Yeah, in that little like server room in
NASDAQ, there's actually a lot of value
into having that part run. But to build
a single global kind of layer for all
these stuff to synchronize, I think that
that's kind of the challenge that we
want to take on. Um, how fast is going
to happen? And I think I think the fact
that we now have stable coin legislation
and that people are projecting like 1
trillion to 10 trillion worth of digital
dollars being minted over the next you
know 5 years is going to massively
accelerate things because those dollars
are going to get minted for all sorts of
trade purposes and settlement between
you know like in inner country and and
basically globally. And once those
dollars are there, it's just a very
simple interface to interact with them.
Even yeah, the the price to move dollars
from Ethereum to Salana is a million
times cheaper than to move it between
any two banks.
>> We we had we had Jeremy Aair on the pod
two weeks ago, so we're discussing this.
See, what are you what are you thinking
right now?
>> Um it feels to me like one of the most
incredible applications here would be
the whole DeFi world. And can you speak
to what you guys are doing there?
>> Yeah, so I I think of you know like what
are smart contract platforms do is they
implement some kind of escrow mechanism
is that you can escrow money and then
conditionally release it based on some
action in the future and that's could be
altering complete computation or
whatever. Um, [snorts]
and DeFi is basically the use case for
this is being able to conditionally
place money at risk based on oracle or
market or whatever some future signal.
Um, and I think it effectively applies
to almost everything that businesses do,
right? Like you have to borrow money
from somebody that requires Astro and
requires risk calculations that are
running all the time and things like
that. So the the challenge here is that
like we have in the US we have a really
really amazing financial system. It was
mostly built kind of like after the
railroad boom and the scams there and
before World War II and kind of a little
bit after World War II as it as that was
exported to the Western world. It was
all built before the internet and it it
functions amazing amazingly because
through a lot of trial and error
regulators actually constructed
processes and systems that are very
robust but they're all human based and
this human action is what forces two-day
settlement. It's like it's very hard to
cut that down to one day or 4 hours or
or 10 milliseconds because people are
are in the loop. um blockchain was built
even Bitcoin with its 10 mil 10 minute
blocks was built well after the internet
and it can rely on cryptography and the
fact that I don't even know if NATO can
actually reliably partition the internet
anymore like it we we live in a super
connected connected world and we
[snorts] have cryptography that can
mathematically guarantee correctness of
[clears throat] of of certain actions
>> you know just just to reinforce your
point you just made I was at a public
company board meeting all morning and we
were talking about something we might be
interested in acquiring. And one of the
board members said, "Well, maybe they'll
just go public." And the other board
members said, "There hasn't been a an
IPO below a $3 billion valuation in like
decade. You can't even afford the legal.
The friction is so high." Like, "Wow,
how's that going to work in the world of
AI?" Like, the friction is way too high
for that system. Like you said, built
after the railroad,
>> Texas, baby,
>> before World War II,
>> the Texas exchanges are coming.
>> Yeah. But there's there's 50,000 meme
coins launched a day and there hasn't
been a single IPO and like you know the
number of IPOs I think have shrunk to
the slowest level since like the 70s or
something like that.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's
>> I'd like to pull on that that point if I
might totally I mean so I think stable
coin amazing right? So, so you know the
Collison brothers call it uh room
temperature superconductors for finance
in principle driving international money
transfer efficiency to infinity. But
what in your mind is sort of the the
killer app for layers two and three that
expands the the wealth of humanity
versus just driving efficiencies at at
in terms of money tren. like where's the
Dows for a while? We're going to to
create an entirely new class of economic
actors um mixed sort of success. What's
the big transformative outcome that we
get that radically expands human wealth?
>> Um I think the what you should start
seeing is the cost of finance to
basically drop to its vual value it's
providing. So the the challenge here is
like you like you look at like the um
Figment IPO I think what what they lost
like 3 billion right in that process in
a single transaction. That's 10% of the
market cap of the company which is kind
of crazy where if if you have 10 1 to 10
trillion stable coins you have
incredibly deep onchain markets. they
could literally just use a smart
contract to direct list. And if they use
like a a third party to go actually
create that market, that party has to
actually provide the value that
comparable to to what they're getting
for it, right? Like they could maybe
like be the person that they use an
analyst or whatever to actually go dive
deep into the company and like create
that nice set of information that
everyone else consumes so they can
participate with, you know, safety or
whatever in that market. But none of the
listing or access to capital, all of the
stuff is fully on chain. There's zero
cost to actually get access to it. Like
all you're trying to do then is get
above the noise floor in terms of like
signal. Yeah, you should allocate
capital here because of XYZ. Um, and
providing that value I think is
important and then how much you charge
for it should be at the most competitive
price ever. Like I think this is where
we see like I think finance right now is
taking out a huge chunk of like the GDP
and it's a tax. It's not actually
generating as much value as it's
>> hand in the gears.
The statistic I've seen is over the last
decade of the corporate American profits
sent 40% of corporate American profits
went to the financial services sector.
It's like an unbelievable
uh sucking sound there.
>> But pulling the thread on that if I may.
So I if if the desired end state in your
mind is basically driving profits in
financial services to zero um a is there
is there anything beyond that or like if
if if blockchain technologies in general
not not just Salana's layer 1
specifically are able to suck all the
profit out of financial services do you
declare victory is is that sort of the
the end and you move on to something new
or is there something even larger than
just making financial services
profitless? I think the end result of
that is you basically have talent
anywhere in the world. So that can
acquire capital from anywhere in the
world and that unlocks like human
potential, right? Like I have a really
great idea. I'm an engineer in Ukraine
or whatever. I can now get funding from
people in China, US, Australia and I'm
not relying on the um you know the kind
of the trust model that like a a safe is
based on NYC. that the fact that YC do
did due diligence in this particular
person that then you can invest in them
and this kind of flimsy contract that
right like I think which which is
awesome like I think the fact that that
works and reliably reliably produces
great results is testament to like how
important finance is and to like
[clears throat] innovation so we need to
eliminate all those barriers so you can
actually have as many founders in the
world starting companies and getting to
that profitable state and creating
value.
>> This is the velocity of the velocity of
money
um going through the roof, right? It's
it's accessibility and velocity finding
the lowest level um and and just
becoming a a fuel to for acceleration of
the economy. Can can you give us your
vision on the regulatory like if you
look at Meror as an example you here's a
company two years old getting close to a
billion dollars of revenue unleashed a
whole new class of employee in the AI
world but still paying them through
traditional banking means and obviously
that needs to move on to Solana and be
frictionless but you've had an
incredible journey through different
regulatory regimes in just in just your
sevenyear history it's got to be the
most crazy roller coaster and that's
just in the US. Look at the, you know,
every jurisdiction in the world. So,
how's that going to unfold as this, you
know, this over-the-top economy rolls
out?
>> Uh, I mean, Paul Atkins and Hester Peers
have been awesome and David Saxs has
been awesome. And you can kind of think
of uh that like the the whole securities
law was created in United States. So,
when your neighbor says, "I have this
railroad certificate. Give me some money
for it." And you get it. that one is
it's a real certificate that railroad
company exists and you have all the
information to actually make that
decision. So a lot of stuff can go wrong
there, right? The even if your neighbor
is not lying to you, they could
literally have a fake piece of paper or
the company doesn't exist or the company
lied about everything that it's doing
and there is no actual railroad. So
those scams actually happened and fueled
a lot of railroad construction and a lot
of kind of bad financial decisions in in
the late 19th century
>> and a lot of regulatory paperwork.
>> Exactly. So what's cool now is is the
the difference that blockchain creates
is kind of like the SSL little lock in
e-commerce in the '90s. I can transfer
you a token. You can cryptographically
verify that this token goes back to the
issuer with the issuer's public keys
that signed off on their financial
statements, all the stuff that they
published, their swan, etc. And you know
that you're actually receiving what
they're claiming to be their equity. So
when you're paying for it, all those
guarantees that are solved with
regulation are now just solved with math
and data. Just like the SSL lock tells
you when I put in my credit card number
here, some inter intermediary sending
this data is not going to steal my
credit card. So, a lot of stuff that
humans do kind of goes away. And the
regulators have a hard time getting up
to speed to that because there's a lot
of stuff that simply works. And there's
no reason to change stuff that works
when there's a lot of financial risk at
stake. But the fact that the whole
crypto industry outside of support of
any regulation has been able to grow so
dramatically to such a large market cap
like with Bitcoin and Ethereum and
Salana kind of leading it um is the fact
that this stuff actually solves real
world problems. The reason why somebody
in Singapore can go start a protocol
around trading coins and make money and
ROI is because people can trust that
settlement and execution of those assets
and they're willing to put money at risk
and because the software minimizes the
risk they can maximize the amount of
money they actually put at risk into
these systems. So it's happening anyways
like it's happening with or without
United States. I think with uh the
regulation on board now and like with
the stable coin act like coming out, I
think you're just going to see this
accelerating and a lot of these services
and and kind of um the intermediaries
along the stack are all like one
resistant to change, but also there's so
many of them. Some of them are always
looking for an opportunity to move up
and down their their vertical and and
kind of expand.
May maybe dwelling for for a moment on
the regulatory side. So I in a paper
contract you know you mentioned the the
Y combinator safe earlier you have a few
parties and there's a whole societal
apparatus built around paper contracts.
You have court systems and rule of law
and regulations w with u with salana or
or other smart contract you have to
first order approximately none of that.
Uh and so so I'm curious where do you
see this going? Do you think rule of law
basically moves onchain in some sense
with with bodies to adjudicate disputes
also onchain? How do disputes work in a
future where hypothetically everything's
on chain?
>> I think you're minimizing the number of
intermediaries necessary to go do the
right thing. So if somebody raises money
and they lies they lie about their
purpose of of raising those funds,
that's fraud. And if they do it on a
public blockchain or not, they're still
liable. Doesn't matter whether they do
it with a safe or not. What changes is
that if you do it on chain is that I
don't have to rely on some transfer
agent or broker or whatever to
facilitate moving these contracts around
or to certify that this this contract
actually does belong to this YC company.
You can actually do all that
verification. And so all kind of the
boring stuff that people don't think
about when they think about finance, all
those little service layers that all
take a few bips off the top, those go
away and you're dealing directly with
that company as the issuer. They could
they could obviously use some third
party service provider to implement the
software to manage all of these things
and there's a bunch of them like squads
on Salana is like a great example of
that formally verified multi-IG
contracts for managing governance and
all this stuff. But at the end of the
day, if it's a company that's claiming
they're doing X and you buy this thing,
the end result that enforces whether
that company's lying or not is going to
be the local jurisdiction where they're
incorporated and they're still just as
liable.
>> I totally totally get it as a stepping
stone toward where Alex is going.
>> Um the actual just the safe note itself.
So just to take this hypothetical
transaction, you know, I want to invest
in your company. You're in Singapore. Uh
here's my money. It's on chain. Uh what
about the safe node itself? Do you just
store that and hash it and then put the
hash on chain or how do how do you deal
with the actual terms of the safe note
or do you not touch that?
>> I mean this is where you want to draw
the abstraction. There are there are
efforts to actually use the ledger as
the the cap table. So whatever's on the
ledger, however these safe nodes are
allocated and distributed those public
keys, private keys, that's the actual
cap table. And then you can build all
the cap table management software on top
of that because that's a public data
structure. You can manipulate and move
those around and whatever rules you want
around clawing back shares or only
allowing transactions if the company
agrees. You can encode all those in a
smart contract reliably. Um, and all
that stuff is just code. It's a pain in
the butt because it's a bunch of
database kind of gnarly code, but it's
all doable. Um, but this would be the
best way to do it because then you're
getting rid of all these other layers,
transfer agent, brokers, etc. Like all
those people are gone.
>> Not just that, but I don't want to beat
this Y cominator safe note to death, but
but if you look at the actual terms of
the note, because we do these every day,
>> uh, they're not settled in the courts,
you know, they they go straight to jams
or to some third party because the
courts will be years before they decide
what they want to do. And so it's
already it's not on chain, but it's
certainly out of the courts. and out of
the federal and and state system because
it's just too slow.
>> So like I think bankruptcy could be one
of those things that could be
dramatically optimized where it took
like two years to resolve the FTX
bankruptcy. Um that was a massive
bankruptcy in crypto, but because FTX is
not is a is a centralized exchange that
is not a as a company a DeFi company,
right? They just bought and sold tokens
like a any other centralized financial
system. when they collapse, it's
incredibly messy to go and bind all of
that and [snorts] like to go through the
bankruptcy law and figure out who owns
what. When in reality, if it was like a
single ledger, even if it was a
permission one, if they just ran a
ledger, one is you would immediately see
that the amount of money going out is
more than the amount of money going in.
[laughter]
That would be obvious immediately. So,
you you wouldn't even get to that stage
where you have bankruptcy. But if you
did like A has liquidations which is
effectively the bankruptcy process when
you borrow and you and you can't repay
those are programmatically encoded and
run on every block every 12 seconds in
Ethereum and Camino does it every 400
milliseconds on Salana. So you would
never even get to that stage where you
have to spend 2 years to figure out who
owns what. It would get liquidated and
processed immediately. And I think that
is a really critical part in finance.
Like if if you can invest knowing that
in case of a bankruptcy that there is
this deterministic process that's run
immediately. Everyone gets the best what
you could get out of of out of that
process within like a minute. It makes
investing a lot more viable especially
across jurisdictions where you may not
have uh the ability to go uh enforce it
in the courts like in Ukraine or
whatever. So I think those those FTX
investors were getting 50 50 cents on
the dollar, 60 cents on the dollar
because of I it's just an insane amount
of money lost in that friction just in
that FTX case.
>> Uh let's go to Sem. Sem ask a really
intelligent question that I'll
understand. Okay.
>> Well, I want to make two points then
I'll ask a question. The question the
point one point I want to make is
there's a really important distinction
around digital and crypto which is the
value of crypto is not the fact that
it's digital. is the fact that it's
programmable and what Tony talks about
when you can do settlements all
programmatically it manages it all you
it's all done you don't have to think
about it and that takes it away from the
human layer and it takes it away from
all sorts of other things I think it's
worth for our readers at whatever time
to just take a step back and understand
the Byzantine general's problem because
that's actually sitting at the core of a
lot of this so I'm I'm happy to get into
that question but can I take a minute
and describe that Peter
>> sure
>> yeah of course
>> okay so
>> I remember I remember you were the first
person ever to tell me about it.
>> This is such a fun foundational thing.
So for the viewers that aren't familiar
with Bitcoin blockchains, Salana, etc.
The core innovation at the heart of
blockchains was what's called the
Byzantine general's problem. It's
actually the story of Constantinople in
the 15th century. There were eight
generals circling the city. They're
trying to coordinate a siege and they
were sending messages around that
network. Who's going to go first? What
time should we attack? Who? How are we
going to get in? etc. And the problem
they had was one out of the eight
generals was a traitor and could send
the wrong information, lose the element
of surprise, blow the whole operation.
And in computer science terms, that's
become known as that problem because in
and in computer science terms, it's how
do you send a trusted, secure,
authenticated message over a network
when you don't trust the network, right?
Really hard problem. 40 years of
computer science piece has been trying
to solve that problem until the
blockchain. And because of the consensus
mechanism and the synchronization across
multiple ledgers, you can now the if I
send to a message, he has a 100%
guarantee that it came from me, wasn't
double entered, can't be revoked, wasn't
tampered along the way. That's a magical
thing in the digital world. And this
provides an authentication layer and a
validity and a validation layer that
allows all of this other stuff to take
place. We all of the layers that we
talked about in the settlement stuff,
etc., are all there to validate, secure,
ratify, etc. This stuff wasn't screwed
along along the way. Now that all
happens as part of the infrastructure
and so that makes it unbelievably
powerful. The broader implications of
decentralizing authentication are
absolutely profound. And so for folks
that aren't aware of this, go check out
this particular problem and the nuances
around it. Um, I have a question around
that specifically.
>> Add the double spending. Add the double
spending problem in there too. Double
spending problem. You can't you can't
get that into into that either which
which is uh can you stop somebody from
double spending in two different places
and then doubling up every time. Um the
the question I have for you Tony early
on there was a lot of criticism of
Salana for the decentralization over the
last couple of years you guys have
solved a lot of that and I think it
would be really great for you to explain
what you guys have been doing and the
architectural changes that have taken
place because now it's really solid and
robust and on its way to Ethereum level
decentralization.
I think there's a lot of um if you're on
crypto Twitter, people fight about what
is what does decentralization actually
means. Um and it just depending who you
ask, it's whatever coin they own is
decentralized and whatever coin they
don't own is not. [laughter]
But uh the way that I think um I've
always approached it is I'm kind of a
you know started programming in the '9s.
I'm a huge like open source Linux fan.
So it was just awesome for me to be able
to analyze the software that I'm running
on my computer and know exactly what's
happening, know why it's broken, why
it's not. So we've always looked at
permissionless being as the core part of
decentralization that it doesn't matter
if uh the system is open source but can
I participate in every part of the stack
without needing um like to be uh without
needing a third party to approve me. So
can I run a validator? Can I make
blocks? Can I transact on it? Can I
deploy code on it? But can I also own
this like have a copy of that state and
be able to recover the entire network if
if that kind of failure exists. So
Salana is always focused on that aspect
of it that everybody every part of the
system that anyone can run that it's
permissionless to go and run it. And I
think that is incredibly critical for
this idea of a single layer for finance
because no matter what, you're still
going to be dealing with people. Like if
you have the science fiction futuristic
layer finance for all of the world's
execution, it's still going to run in
France and England and Spain and none of
those guys are ever going to really
trust each other 100%. So [laughter]
the the banks in France will need to be
able to participate in every part of the
stack. So will the banks in England, so
will the banks in New York, even if
they're allies or whatever, but they
need because they're people, they want
to have control that they will need to
have access to every part of the system.
And to make it really decentralized, you
have to allow for adversarial nodes that
are either misconfigured or actually
deliberately adversarial like the
Byzantine problem that you described
where they're maliciously signing the
wrong message. They're trying to double
spend. They're trying to create chaos in
the network. The protocol has to be
robust to handle that. Um, and you can
work it out on on paper. you can say we
have all these proofs and formal
verification that it actually is
uh robust with the Byzantine actors and
then in implementation things blow up. I
think the Salana journey has been that
of we're trying to solve all of these
problems at the same time, both
performance and decentralization and
doing it, you know, as a startup
shipping as fast as we can. There's a
lot of trial and error or I would say
growing pains or blood, sweat, and tears
that went into making Salana robust.
>> It's incredible. Incredible what you
pulled off.

>> Here, here's a challenge. What
percentage of the of the world or let's
look at the US do you believe
understands crypto at all
if you had to guess?
>> Um, a tenth of 1% of the population.
>> I think anyone that
finished calculus can understand it. I
mean basically can understand it the
difference between can understand and do
understand. So I mean one of the one of
the questions is you know the idea of
Salana as the everything coin that I'm
using um let's define what that means
first. What would salana as the
everything coin mean
>> and then what would it take?
>> Yeah go ahead.
>> The coin itself that runs the network
its only purpose is to prevent spam in
the network. So fundamentally like the
only problem that it can solve is
disincentivized spam. So as part of
solving this Byzantine general's problem
where an adversarial node can send
infinite messages, there's a cost to
send messages. That's the coin. But to
use it for anything else simply because
it is tradable or can be easily sent, it
exists as any other coin in the network.
And you can use I mean we encourage
people to go use dollars for commerce.
If you're buying and selling stuff as a
merchant, go use USDC or PayPal's USD or
any other digital currency. Um so that
that to us it kind of doesn't matter
what the coin the underlying token that
provides cryptoeconomic guarantees that
adversaries pay some fixed cost for
spam. That doesn't really matter like
what you use it beyond that. Um what's
kind of been surprising to me and really
this has really been like you know when
you start a startup not only you have no
idea what PMF is going to look like but
the fact that as soon as you have
markets and you have um money at escrow
and at risk the opportunity cost to be
late to access those markets is so high
that the fact that this underlying token
is what prevents spam in the network it
can actually capture value that is uh
like substantial this the 2 billion
whatever that you guys mentioned
captured over the last years on Salana
that is because there's an opportunity
cost to be late to send a trade and
you're willing to pay the highest amount
to be first in the queue to actually go
execute the trade and underneath the
hood the only thing that the token is
doing is preventing spam. So the fact
that it actually loops back and allows
value capture for this thing
>> that was not planned and totally
unexpected and almost like discovered
[clears throat] through trial and error
of us
>> getting such so much massive congestion
on the network from NFT trading
>> that that was the only way to solve the
problem and it was kind of the slight
bone limit. Oh one this is a classic
database hotspot problem like why didn't
I think of this when we started it's and
two it actually works for money like Was
were the was the craze around NFTTS and
memecoins a surprise to you?
>> Yeah, I mean when we started we you know
our tagline was blockchain and NASDAQ
speed and the idea was we're an
execution layer which can run arbitrary
number of markets and kind of keep them
all in a single state machine to
minimize to maximize capital efficiency,
minimize the arbitrage opportunities. We
thought that was like really valuable
and
um the fact that memecoins took off was
really surprising because those are
assets with no value in all price. But
it kind of, you know, like if you if you
make look back at like the history of
the internet, um it makes sense like if
soon as you have any kind of shared
state that people have even if like I
played Ultima online as a kid and people
would start trading gold and I actually
like built all these silly scripts that
would automat
company.
>> Yeah. British Brock Pierce. Brock
Pierce, our buddy.
>> And those things that that you know,
Ultima Online would is as much digital
value as a memecoin, as Smartcoin.
There's nothing backing it, but people
still wanted to trade and consume it.
One, just for fun, but two, because you
now have this shared state with some
economics. It just for whatever reason,
as soon as you have any kind of shared
state, people create markets and start
trading random things. want to be able
to trade to bring those uh the gold and
the wood between different video games.
How old are your kids?
>> Um 10, six, and two and a half.
>> Okay. I got two 14-y old boys and and so
does Leo, a 14-year-old boy. So, it's
interesting, right? The entire video
game world is teaching an entire
generation about the the value of
digital assets uh in an extraordinary
fashion. Anyway,
>> yeah. Isn't it funny that that video
games, you know, that's where the GPU
came from that's now driving all of AI
and it's where crypto came from that to,
you know, trade gold for wood or
whatever within Minecraft or
>> may maybe to take the the counterpoint
to that, before modern video games, we
had board games and we had credit
systems and sort of fake money systems.
So, it it's not in in some sense that
new. But I I guess may maybe a question
for for totally pivoting off of a
question sort of an adjacent question to
what Peter asked you earlier about how
many people do understand crypto by
which I assume Peter's referring to
cryptocurrency and and sort of layer one
layer layer two how many should because
I I I think you were making the point
earlier almost like lamports soul this
should be sort of under the hood and it
should just make everything
frictionless.
I I think of it as like the number of
people you invite to your wedding is
roughly 200. That's like your your core
group of people.
>> At least one or two of them understand
Linux. One or two of them will
understand crypto. That's [laughter]
and that's enough cuz you can invite
them to your wedding. You can trust
them,
>> right? And they'll explain it to you and
they can like tell you, okay, use it
like this. This is how you minimize your
risk and stuff like that. So I think the
number of people that you actually need
to understand crypto in the world is
like one in 200 like one per social
group. Your extended trust circle
>> probably there.
>> So I think that that's that's striking.
What what I understand you to be saying
is this is not something that retail
investors should even be paying
attention to which is contrary to a lot
of messaging out there that everyone
should be paying attention to. So what I
think I hear you saying is this is
actually just infra under the hood to to
to build the next generation of
financial services.
>> I think it is very much a B2B system. I
think there is parts where it touches
the consumer. So I mean when we built
our phone we did a pre-sale and we had
credit card or stable coin as an option.
Half of the purchases came via stable
coin without any incentives because the
friction for somebody in Southeast Asia
to use a stable coin is lower actually
than to use their local credit card for
like an international purchase. So
consumers will figure it out and you
have demand you know like if you have
products that are available over stable
coins people just use those rails on
their own. But it is it was actually the
benefit I think was to us as a merchant
was very obvious. We save 2% on the
gross sale amount which is like a three
or four engineering salaries like easily
just on that one product. So you as a
merchant immediately that you see oh if
I have this rail I don't have to pay the
2% fee. Yeah I'm going to use it like
why wouldn't I? Money's it's money in
the bank instantly. So I think that like
huge improvement that will move dollars
and like will have people take action I
think is going to be more in the
business end but consumers will see the
benefit of that ultimately.
>> A lot of the work now is going to be for
web 3 services. Well, Peter and I talk
about going from deceptive to
disruptive. Uh when something becomes
exponential, it all always has a huge uh
10x change in usability, right? Coinbase
makes Bitcoin easy to buy. Um Salana is
making it easy to transact. The
usability layer has to be there and many
web three services like I some liquidity
pools,
DEX liquidity pools. The the complexity
of going through those and funding a
pool etc is so ridiculous. I have to
have a hardcore uh crypto sherpa
standing next to me to make sure I don't
screw it up. It's insane. And so little
by little those will uptick in terms of
usability and then it'll start becoming
a a very very powerful tool for
everybody.
>> Alex, look you're pregnant with a
question.
>> Yeah. No, I'm I'm I'm I'm trying to wrap
my mind around this. So this is actually
a question both for for Ti and Seem. So
I want to put you guys both on the spot
and ask what do you think? So So let's
fast forward to to the victory state. We
we've we've driven the the future of
financial services to to to these highly
vaunted superconductors for finance.
We've driven transaction costs down to
near zero from credit card fees of 2 to
3%. We've achieved victory. What do you
view as the like the singular killer
app, the concrete state that we've
unlocked in the future that creates
radical wealth for all all of humankind?
What does that look like concretely?
It's hard to to point to saying that
like
um price like accurate price efficiency
globally is that big of a deal to a
person? Like do you care how if you like
if the Starbucks get gets the best price
for their coffee beans and the person
making those gets the best price? Like
these are very abstract things that at
end to end like my parents are not going
to understand to where it really matters
to them. But the GDP will like move
faster. We will make fewer errors in
finance. We will grow faster as a world
and fewer and fewer people will be in
poverty. I think that is kind of very
substantial. Like if 40% Yeah. Like
>> concretely though like so so
>> but but let me ask let me ask you a
question right now. What make what
differentiates America in so many ways?
It's is access to capital right
entrepreneurs uh throughout the US uh
can put forward an idea reach
individuals get access to capital and
one of the questions I have is is this
going to is this going to increase the
speed of entrepreneurial creativity and
financing and company financing where it
just supercharges the economy uh at a
speed you know and Alex we talk about
sort of you know an ex if if I had time
I would rewrite I would rewrite
economics for the future because
economics are so fundamentally broken
and so last century. So is this about
reinventing an economics 2.0 or 3.0?
>> So
you know like all the companies that are
worth over a trillion or like all the
assets they're all US companies or
Bitcoin and I think maybe like the Saudi
oil company, right?
>> Yeah. So the the only place the other
>> like the other place for finance that
can compete with the United States is
the internet
>> and it's happening on the internet
through crypto. So you're so you're now
seeing like the kind of finance and
growth that happened in the United
States being replicated on the internet
through crypto rails and this is the
only place that I think could compete
with the United States and actually in
my opinion
at a gut level I think it is effectively
helping United States export its
influence because the internet is truly
an extension of all the values that we
care about in the United States and it's
so we're so deeply plugged into it. I
can give a kind of an anecdote, a real
life anecdote that could maybe highlight
some of this, Peter. Um, and maybe to
answer your uh question, Alex. If you
look at say the NFT world where they
started doing art on the internet,
right? You create a collection of 10,000
things uh 10,000 apes and start selling
those and mint those. Uh, you have a
community building around those. All
those, by the way, were default EXOs
because they would have a big purpose
and they would use cryptoeconomics to
incentivize the community to mint. The
first people that got to mint got them
for very cheap and then if you minted
later, you paid a little bit more, etc.,
etc. What then happened was you had a
bunch of breakages in the system. There
were some rug pulls where people
collected a lot of money and and the
collection were basically down on the
vine, etc. People are now doing uh
turnarounds where they're buying old
collections uh that are really good art
and and repurposing them, etc. There's a
whole M&A thing going on in the in the
NFT world. Uh what's fascinating about
this is that it's art in a different
form because it's programmatic art.
That's an experience of the art that's
not normal that you would look at a
painting on a wall. You're engaging with
it in a digital mode. So with board apes
for example, they gave the ability to
take the the if you own a board ape, you
own the intellectual property of that
character and you could license it out
to people and to TV shows and people
started doing that and that created one
new wave of innovation. Then we had uh
cyber kongs that that created the coins
within the thing. So they the if you own
a cyber Kong uh NFT, it issued bananas
to you which trade as a secondary
utility token. But I I want to challenge
you on this. Hold on. Let me let me The
broader point I'm making is
>> doing all of this with lawyers.
>> The broader point I'm making is
[laughter]
>> or imagine not doing it at all. Let let
me make my bigger point. My bigger point
is as you get through this all of the
stuff that's happening, there's a
there's a collective level of innovation
at scale that's moving faster than
almost the AI world. It moved faster
than anything I've ever seen before. It
is absolutely profound. And when the
people kind of did an initial set of rug
clothes, now when people issue NFTTS or
issue tokens, you have to hold the token
for 6 months before you can sell it. And
it evens out the the curves. There's all
sorts of things happening at
unbelievable speed. The ecosystem is
learning very very fast. And so there's
something profound happening and
incredibly creative. What's even more
interesting is it's democratized. So
anybody with a great idea can show up
and do something and test it out and see
where it goes. And so there's for that
adds to the collective pool of of
ingenuity.
>> Why I think why is why is these examples
important? I think is because when I
send money into this contract, I have
enough guarantees to know what happens
if in a catastrophic event. So I can
actually go participate in this even if
it's stupid. Even if I'm getting bananas
out of this like
>> how many bananas do you own, Selena?
>> Right. The fact that I can transfer and
transact and sell these bananas. I now
have my risk outline is is very
different than if I had to do this
blindly over eBay to send somebody a a
cashier's check to buy their wood and
Ultima online. That's a very different
type of risk involved there. So, the
chain eliminated a whole bunch of risk
that was previously impossible to
eliminate. And because of this, yeah, a
lot of this stuff is going to accelerate
at the tail end, but the things that now
have an option to go use lawyers and go
through the Figma IPO process through an
investment banking now have an
alternative. So the price through the
traditional processes is going to
collapse down to what's available on
chain like and and right now you have
this massive adverse selection problem
where if I am Figma, I don't need to go
get onchain capital. I can go through
the investment banking process. I've
been building this company for 10 years.
All my lawyers are telling me minimize
risk. You're just going to do an IPO
traditional way and you shouldn't think
about any of these costs because that's
the last thing that you should try to
innovate on. And that's hard for a CEO
to make that decision. But that's going
to shift like I think and that's going
to shift massively and quickly as you
get to this trillion dollar stable coin
amount number and then the $10 trillion
is going to be way past the shift I
think.
>> Yeah.
>> Now you're getting to the meat of where
throw some throw some meat to Alex here.
He'll eat it like a pitbull.
[laughter]
The you know you know Peter's question
about okay I want to raise money for my
company you know 5 million bucks. Why is
this so hard? But the assumption
underneath that is that your company
needs either some physical like iron and
something, but it doesn't anymore. What
does it need? Well, all it needs is
labor for the most part, any of these
virtual companies. Well, why am I
raising $5 million? Why aren't I raising
some virtual thing and paying those
people? You know, if those people end up
being in Venezuela, Ethiopia, and
Ukraine, they don't want US dollars
anyway. and the value if I put a value
on their time you know which I have to
do legally in the US but I don't have to
do across borders they don't want to be
valued at something that's taxed so the
the economy of of you know AI just
solved every math problem known to man
what's that worth is worth a lot okay
well I'm not going to pay for it valued
by a 49a valuation from an accounting
firm in the US and so that whole economy
of trading AI I generated things with
other and even human labor is going to
be completely outside the world of
normal valuations and normal payroll
taxes and normal and because you don't
have to value it in US dollars if you
don't want to and that's where the dam
is going to break.
>> I think even I think even if you value
them in US dollars and I actually think
most markets will go through through US
dollars the fact that you have two
alternative paths. I can use a safe and
go to YC company and go through that
process or I can buy a token in like an
ICO.
And the difference with a token is I
have immediate access to secondary
markets. Both events are just as risky.
You're taking massive risk. And
basically, is this founder a jackass or
not? Like it doesn't matter if it's a YC
founder that's a jackass or an ICO
founder that's a jackass, you're going
to get screwed either way. But the the
guarantees you're getting out of out of
the safe is competing with the fact that
I have secondary markets and this
reliable execution and transfer.
So which one are you going to take as an
investor? Like you you may not actually
be able to get any money out in the
catastrophic event out of the safe or
any value out of that event either way.
Um and the success upside is the same in
both.
>> Yeah. I think I think most governments
think that, you know, regardless of all
the transactions you do on chain, sooner
or later, you're going to want to turn
that into either real estate or labor in
my country and you're going to come back
through my regulatory framework, through
my Treasury Department, through my SEC
to turn it into something that you can
use to enjoy your life. And I think
increasingly that is not true. it's
irrelevant because what you really
wanted is either compute or you know
virtual entertainment or whatever and
you can buy it outside of that
regulatory framework with your Solana
and so that part of the economy today is
not a big deal. I think that dam's going
to break very quickly. And then that
part, it operates across borders
frictionlessly. It operates in
milliseconds and it operates entirely in
the virtual universe. And that economy
will grow so much faster than the
physical economies that it'll be it'll
go from, you know, a rounding error to
dominant in just a few years. That's
that's my guess.
>> If if you're in the US, you pay dollars
market to mark to market to US dollars
in taxes. So even if you make your
profit and soul, you have to market to
market and cover your dollar exposure.
Otherwise, you're running a debt to the
to the place that can collect it with
with a carrier ship full of F F35s or
whatever. [clears throat]
>> That speaks to my original question,
which is government and governance
mostly doesn't live on chain right now.
So to to the extent that Peter, Dave,
and and to some extent Salem are are are
aspirationally hoping that we're going
to live in an utterly frictionless
economy, it seems the elephant in the
room is that all of this physical
government apparatus and the court
system and jams and methods for
adjudication. These are all offchain. So
I guess
let me take it, Alex. Let me take it
there cuz this is the conversation we
had with with Jeremy from Circle in
which I was asking him when do you think
we're going to see the first fully
onchain corporation, right? Where
contracts, payments, treasury,
governance, and even all of the agents
employed by that company are on the
blockchain, right? And we have the
explosion of a a new corporate structure
that's operating at light speed compared
to everything else. Do you imagine we're
going to have that? When could we have
that?
I think you can go look at kind of the
the cool experiments in this would be
metadowi
decision marketbased Dows where um you
effectively every decision that this
coin does or this group that holds the
coin is using a futary mechanism where
should we go invest in this or should we
pay these engineers why? The way that
these decisions market work is you're
basically saying if the market decides
yes and I'm willing to buy your Metadow
tokens at price Y. So I'm willing to pay
more for this for Apple stock if they go
and build uh you know iPhone 20 or
whatever
>> or but or if
does that make sense? This this is like
the kind and I would say the the closest
thing you're going to get to full
onchain governance and corporate control
over funds and assets. Peter, I'd like
to try to answer your question, but but
then forward a sub question to to Tobi,
if I might.
>> I I think the answer to your question
relies on a sub question, which is when
will we see, at least within the US, the
first state government approve a new
type of corporation that is an onchain
autonomous corporation. It it require it
would be require an act of a state
government at minimum. By some question,
>> Texas, Texas or Florida? Yeah. Yeah,
>> go ahead. Get
>> Wyoming's go for it.
>> Wyoming's shown very advanced in uh
crypto adoption and acceptance.
>> They actually issued a stable coin where
as you interpret the law because they're
sovereign. They're neither a person or a
corporation. And they they've issued a
stable coin under their own kind of
regulatory scheme, which is uh
interesting to think about.
But Puerto Rico, you know, Puerto Rico
is inside the the realm of the F-35
circling around yet completely
independent from the federal government.
>> That that's potentially a birthplace for
this whole thing.
>> Well, today you can already
>> Wait, wait, wait. Let's let's take this
home.
>> So So the the the sub question then
would be, okay, so so you have
hypothetical preference for Wyoming,
maybe Puerto Rico. When does this
happen? When do we see the first in in
in your prediction to when do we see the
first state level government in the
United States in enshrine in in statute
the ability for an autonomous
corporation which by the way could be an
AI as a person as well doesn't
necessarily have to be an onchain entity
>> is this I'm not 100% sure but I thought
there were DAO friendly bills already
being passed in Wyoming specifically for
creating these kind of corporate
structures
that um assign control or parts of the
control of the fiduciary duties to a
dial.
>> Yes, there are. We looked into this.
Wyoming does allow that. The problem is
you're still under the the federal
>> uh SEC issues. But I'll give you this
thing in in Panama. There's a couple of
other places where that you can have
foundations that create Dows and those
are fully decentralized autonomous
organizations and then everything can be
run from the DAO and the DAO owns
everything. So it's really it's almost
like a trust with digitized crypto
enabled transactions going through it.
>> You actually don't need these things. I
think the key part that you need out of
I think the federal in a government and
laws is that um if you participate in
the smart contract that your liabilities
are not co-mingled with everyone else
that participates. This is kind of like
I think either needs to be passed
through Congress through the market
structure bill or kind of figured out in
the courts is that once that's true, the
fact that like you can now participate
in these Dows and and things like that,
those those effectively become code is
law because if the government says that
your liabilities are limited, you're not
part of this cohort, that you're
responsible for everyone's actions that
participate [snorts] in this in this
mechanism, and the only thing that you
have is the code, then you are solely
relying on the code to enforce all the
decisions of that thing. So if you if
you go into it and you lose money,
tough, right? Like you've actually taken
on the risk and there's nobody for you
to go after anymore. So this it's more
like I don't think we need laws to pass
to allow it. What we need is laws or
courts to figure out that you don't have
liabilities if you participate in these
systems and that's about it. See, I
think you
>> exist just by existing.
>> You you've put your your finger on I I
think the the core issue for the future
of this entire space, which is what does
the future of law as code look like? And
I I think there are sort of maybe two
directions, at least two directions I
can imagine it going in. One is I think
what you're articulating, which is in
the future, state plus federal law plus
a whole bunch of regulations get encoded
in something that looks like, you know,
future of layer 1 code. It's basically
software. There is another future where
future of laws and regulations remain
pure natural language, but we have a
whole constellation of AI agents that
are interpreting them basically AI
lawyers, AI regulators. Do you have a
sense of which of those two futures or
maybe door number three we're going to
find ourselves in?
>> Um,
>> I'll I'll answer that question. We start
with number two which is you have AI
agents dealing with natural language law
and then over time we have to develop
completely new forms of mechanisms and
governance structures to deal with it.
Well those will be on chain.
>> What about you Tully? I think um humans
in the loop and kind of how our human
egos are are designed is that you will
have uh this I think like the big short
is this awesome scene where the higher
up the chain of command you go the
dumber the person the the less they
understand about what's happening.
[laughter]
>> The same applies to podcast hosts by the
way.
>> Yeah. [laughter]
Oh,
>> I think because of just human nature of
politics and leadership and all these
things, you're going to see the most
sophisticated understanding of how this
stuff works at the lowest layer and then
it go as the the higher up it goes to
the court system to politicians to
regulators the more broad strokes they
have kind of to control it. Um, and my
my view is like I don't think you're
going to have AI agents in that spot
because of human ego. Like I think
[clears throat] humans really really
want or big orgs under them.
>> I just have [laughter] to jump on that
cuz cuz uh
>> I just think it's the coolest thing in
the world that you as a as an individual
engineer you know come into the country
14 years ago whatever settle in San Fran
and invent a hundred billion dollar
thing out of thin air. was created out
of thin air and then to figure out how
it interacts with the government. A guy
David Saxs who has nothing to do with
the government ends up in the role kind
of overnight and now you guys figure it
out together. Show me any other country
on the planet that could ever do that.
But it's exactly what you said from the
big short. You get to any other
jurisdiction and the the factor,
you know, in the way makes it impossible
to [laughter] to interact. It's just the
coolest story. you know, hold on, hold
on. This isn't quite fair. If you take
Switzerland, which has been crypto
friendly for longer than almost anybody,
they passed legislation quite a long
time ago and a huge number of the crypto
founders moved there because it was so
crypto friendly.
>> Japan is friendly. Now there's an
increasing list of countries, Malta,
Likensstein, etc., etc. So, countries
are jumping on board and a lot of the
Binance, etc., A lot of these were
created in places where they were crypto
friendly first and then they worried
about the US later. Uh the US has now
jumped on the bandwagon in a big way
which is fantastic but it's a little bit
too little too late for some things. I
think in other areas it's going to
really take off.
You know, Tony, when when you started
Salana, aentic AI was not even in the
conversation,
>> right? It was uh it was, you know, four
or five years out,
>> right? Just transformers and and I can
imagine that AI agents are going to be
the single biggest uh you know
transactors of Salana. Can you can you
speak to that? Um
>> yeah, I think um if we the the fact that
you can synthesize a lot of signal
around the world through AI like the
amount of cost per intelligence goes
down. What that means is you have an
army of analysts that can understand all
of the signal and synthesize it into
uh buy or sell right signal. You can now
create a lot more markets. And I think
this is where I think stuff like Futarch
can actually potentially become scalable
to large organizations. Um
why like I think this is kind of sort of
happening already is if you like look at
me or Vitalik we're obviously not
business people like I have I'm not a
bra business person that understands
>> you play you play a business person on
TV.
>> Yeah. [laughter] Exactly. Like you're
you're like way too candid and and
honestly
>> he's a researcher. I'm an engineer like
I understand how memory works and stuff
like this but just simply from this
trustless coordination of of blockchain
the fact that you could own a part of
soul and you could actually run the
systems per participate in it that
actually creates enough incentive
alignment for everyone in the ecosystem
to move it towards a common goal. Like
even if each participant is rationally
optimizing their own ENL under the hood,
they're maximally trying to just profit
and sometimes in a zero sum way over
other participants. But because it's all
cryptographically glued together into
this one gen where if there's a bunch of
markets, it all makes money like that
forces the forces everyone to move in
the same direction. I think that is an
example of this class of new
organizations that are not quite
corporations, not quite kind of single
person small business, but an internet
scalable system that's glued together
with cryptography that can all move
together for a common benefit. I think
that's a very very unique cool thing.
And as you have AI explode and the
ability to get
uh analyze a whole bunch of signal into
an action becomes cheaper and cheaper. I
think the number of markets that can
support this decision-m is going to blow
up and hopefully they all run on Salana
and that we make more money from making
sure there's no spam. But that
>> Alex
we'll see like you know
>> Yeah. How many AI agents do you imagine
were going to be operating a decade from
now?
>> I don't think the question is going to
be meaningful a decade from now because
I I think a agents is a very 2025 era
term. I I think we'll look back 10 years
from now and laugh at at the premise of
the question.
>> You have like a [clears throat]
continuous information funnel to GPUs
that's just constantly looping. Is it?
>> Yeah. Like the question doesn't matter.
How many terowatts or paws of
intelligence will we have a decade from
now?
>> And and so we we currently measure AI in
terms of uh of of energy, right? We're
talking about gigawatt data centers and
so forth
>> for the moment. For the moment
>> for the moment. Are we going to start a
new layer of uh of sort of measurement
which is a financial layer of
measurement in terms of how much capital
>> is going to be is going to be
transacting on these systems. uh because
the speed I mean the most the most
valuable bits of information are in bits
of information that carry financial
value with them right so uh
>> but that's circular though like that
that that's circular to say what's most
valuable is most financialized like
ideally and and totally keep me honest
on this I would hope 10 years from now
we're we're in a state where we've not
just solved math but we've solved
economics we we have like a a rigorous
science of what wealth is we have the
beginnings of it today arguably But if
you put 10 economists in a room and you
ask them like what is real wealth,
you'll get maybe 20 different answers. I
would hope we have actually like a
decade from now a notion of what real
wealth is. Not just monetized wealth,
but actual wealth. And then we could
actually trade real wealth. But to my
knowledge, we don't know what real
wealth.
>> Probably just energy. It's just jewels.
>> Maybe not.
>> Or I'll give you an alternative too,
which is transistor flips or flat. Well,
flops isn't right, but but it's going to
be some metric of compute that's more
foundational than the dollar or any
concept of curren currency. Right now,
we're all trained that wealth is dollars
and and there, you know, the foundation
metric is dollars, but that's going to
break very quickly and it'll be
something either either power, you know,
electrical power, but I think more
likely some metric of compute.
>> I'd like to I'd like to challenge all of
this. Um you know we've had for the last
few hundred years the main mode of
discourse in the world has been business
commerce money right and we run the
world on that and we floated off feudal
systems and now the power is in the
power of money which is more liquid free
flowing it'll funds good ideas etc etc
but we're moving moving over the last
few decades from money to information a
startup today is much more interested in
collecting data about its users and then
we'll monetize it later Facebook maybe
has done the best job of taking social
data and monetizing and it's fungeible.
You can go back and forth. Over time
though, uh the the information becomes
the harder bit and the monetary side
becomes less relevant. And so I would
think that over time you'll end up in a
Star Trek world where you don't have any
money. You don't have any commerce.
You're just doing things and it the the
the the cost of things becomes so
meaningless. It doesn't m com the idea
of commerce doesn't matter. So that
would be my challenge. I I'll challenge
the challenge and and say that this this
very much feels like a very uh October
2025 era discussion where we've seen
large parts of the West
de-industrialized for a couple of
decades and we're we're just taking it
as an axiomatic truth. Oh well, like
we're de-industrialized. So, of course,
it it's just about the bits. It's not
about the atoms. But actually, the atoms
are incredibly important. Uh, and and I
I would argue if I had to to choose my
my favorite denomination of real wealth,
it's it's going to be something embedded
in the physical world. Like I I've
argued in the past something about
future freedom of action. If we could
quantify future freedom of action of
humanity that in yeah in cubits or or
even classical bits like that that's the
closest I can come up with for a real
definition of wealth. But I'd be curious
to to like what's your best definition
of wealth?
Uh,
okay. I I'll give like a hot take. I
think it's like Shannon's law. How how
much information we can process.
>> Um, so like our channel capacity to
process information is real wealth.
>> It'll be a measure of information.
>> Yeah, I agree. It'll be measured in
units of information.
>> Time out. I'm taking this in a different
direction. So one of the things I'm
concerned about right now given the
speed at which we're getting wealth
aggregation into the large uh you know
hyperscalers and given the fact that we
have uh not in the long term but in the
short term I think a job dislocation is
that there's a lot of people really
concerned about civic unrest right about
we had uh Bology on the pod talking
about I would not want to be a tech
entrepreneur in the Bay Area in 2 or 3
You guys remember that in terms of uh
you know I have a few of my friends who
in the VC world getting death threats
right now. It's crazy. I mean really
really crazy. So my my question is how
are how can we potentially see Salana
and the crypto world help ease this
tension that we're going to have of this
discontinuity because I think in the
long run to we have you know I all I
speak about and write books about is
this world of abundance where we're
demonetizing and democratizing access to
food, water, energy, healthcare,
education. It's the interim state,
right? the next two to eight years that
I'm most concerned about. What are your
thoughts there?
>> I I'm actually I kind of have a very
opposite view of biology here.
>> Probably maybe because I don't know my
parents came to the to United States
from the USSR literally with $50 per
person like in '92. So I think
>> what we're seeing with AI is a less a
smaller transformation in terms of labor
than the steam engine. like the amount
of people that actually became
unemployed because of the steam engine
was dramatically more. And those were
like all fighting age dudes. Like uh I I
think um the likely outcome is that you
we just get better at what we do and the
jobs become less easier, less risky and
you can scale up and the amount of
wealth that you create for the world and
the poverty decreases and people just
simply work less. And the difference
between the kind of work that my dad had
to do as a civil engineer in the USSR
versus here was like night and day in
terms of risk like and that was just
moving across like the you know the
Atlantic Ocean into like a more mature
economy. So I think the world is only
going to get wealthier and we're blessed
to live in this age. So I'm like very
optimistic.
>> It's the most exciting time to be alive.
Yeah, for Open AI is not shrinking its
headcount. And this is the most advanced
AI company.
[laughter] Like they're they're not
hiring less people. They're hiring
really smart people and giving them the
best tools to accelerate that company.
But that's only going to happen
everywhere. I think you're going to end
up with a lot of demand for people that
understand how AI works, where where it
makes mistakes and can course correct it
and keep it on track. I think that
that's probably going to be a super
valuable skill. And
if anything, I think of that comes from
experience. My experience with AI tools
is that I can keep like half an open eye
watching cloud stream its code and know
that it's doing something right or
wrong. Whether like a junior engineer
has to actually analyze every commit and
stuff like I think you you will see the
exact same kind of uh systems that you
that you did with just advent of
databases and computers. Like everyone
that was an accountant didn't just like
become homeless. They just they're super
smart people with college education that
are like have incredible access to
networks that can go and retrain a lot
easier than I think everyone else.
>> What's your take on this?
>> Well, I think as you if if we have a
kind of a breakdown in society like
you're talking about, right? What you
end up happening is because it's so easy
to build a crypto system today, you
could create a local community DAO that
circulates tokens just amongst itself
and you can spend those tokens on
certain things and very quickly boot up
a lo a local economy, right? Notice note
that most monetary transactions 80% are
local. You're buying supplies, you're
you're getting your haircut, whatever,
whatever. Not the amount of money, but
the number of transactions. And so
crypto because
>> it's a strange example for you to use.
>> Sorry,
>> it's a strange example for you to use.
Get your hand.
>> It is a strange example for for me to
use. Um [laughter]
uh but so this becomes really powerful
to replace and and very this is why I
believe that we're moving to we're going
to move to very granular environments
where people will create small
communities that self-support. This
supports biology's network state idea.
we just need to keep enough to for the
internet to keep going and everything's
fine. If that breaks down then you have
major issues. But I remember this
wonderful story in the 70s where there
was a huge central banking strike in
Ireland and uh the there were just no
checks getting cleared. No checks were
getting cleared and for 2 years uh the
Irish just kept going. They just kept
passing checks around saying well when
the central bank comes back online it'll
settle on. And two years later the
central bank went wow nobody nobody's
even noticed we're on strike. we might
as well come back because and then they
cleared all the checks and then business
went back to usual, right? And so human
beings are incredibly resilient at
figuring things out and I think when we
get into major issues like that, we'll
figure it out.
>> Dave, I'm hugely biased cuz cuz totally
to me is the most perfect example of the
person you want to be. Like after he's
done with this podcast, he's going to go
debug some code. he's building it and
and we're discussing like you know what
does this AI philosopher who's never
done squat over here think of it and
it's [laughter] like it's like it's just
like your perspective and especially
when you come from a foreign country you
know I had the same conversation with
Thomas Pedy who was born in Hungary in a
basement as the Soviet tanks were coming
in and he he can't connect with his own
kids who grew up here and they're like
oh we're destroying the world you know
dad you're polluting by taking a dump
and [laughter] he's like what are you
talking about we live in the best time
in world history and in the most free
and fair place in the world and you're
not taking advantage of it like but but
what to doing is actually building the
future platform from all of society and
it's going to create the abundance that
Peter is talking about and to me to me
your perspective is exactly the right
one and I I'm not even vaguely connected
to the alternate perspective makes no
sense to me but but everything you just
said perfectly resonates with me I mean
it's like it's exactly the right view.
>> Anyway, that's my that's my
>> appreciate it. Yeah,
>> you know, uh I I I am I am curious about
something. We've just seen Kazakhstan
launch a stable coin on Salana um and
how do projects like that I mean does
that get you excited? What projects are
getting you excited right now about the
use of the technology you created?
Because there might I mean you must wake
up in the morning and say, "Holy
that's amazing what someone just did
with Salana."
Um, I think crypto is going through like
technology phases similar to the
internet. You had the punks create the
first version, then you had the hoodies
kind of scale it up and now the suits
are moving in. So, a lot of the stuff
that's happening is driven by suits,
which is great, but I'm less connected
to that and more to I think the the
low-level experiment. So I think like
folks if they really really want to kind
of be a bit deep in crypto, go check out
Futarchy and decision markets and how to
run a collective like an online
collective that makes real financial
decisions but fully market-based. So in
a way that minimizes risk for investors,
participants, etc. I think those kind of
things are like what I think are really
really cool. And to me it's also kind of
a physics problem. Can we run a market
for every, you know, for the top 10
million important decisions that people
make to make in the world every day?
>> Just to drill into that,
>> that would be that would be cool, right?
>> Yeah. Just to drill into that for a
second, what Toby's talking about is
Futarch allows you to use prediction
markets to do Dowo governance. Okay. And
one of the big issues with Dows is how
do you manage governance? Because it's
like you're in a town hall meeting with
everybody shouting loudly.
>> It's not quite combined with the worst
dynamics of a meeting. It's not just Dow
>> Simone,
right?
>> It's not quite a prediction market. It's
literally like if Apple said that, you
know, I I propose Apple builds this VR
device and I'm willing to buy your Apple
stock for a higher price than it's
currently trading because I'm so bullish
on on this idea that the man that the
managers need to do. So, I'm willing to
increase your value if you don't if you
disagree with me. So, this in fact
forces a financial stake for any
decision to be made in this in in this
DAO, which is different than let's all
vote with our shares and say, "Yeah, we
approve this or we not don't approve it
because you literally have to put your
money where your mouth is for any
decision that that this Dow takes."
>> Amazing. So, it's really really cool
idea and they've run a couple ICOs that
have um have gotten like over $150
million in in in uh commits which is
pretty pretty crazy.
>> Wow.
Um I asked you a question, didn't hear
the answer though, but in terms of you
know super exciting projects uh that
that you're looking forward to on on
Salenum, anything you can share with us?
Obviously, Salana Mobile, so go buy a
Seeker if you don't have one. Uh, this
is
>> Show it to us. Tell us about it. Tell us
about the Seeker.
>> Um, we have two goals. One, I think, is
uh because I spent most of my career at
Qualcomm, it was just immediately
obvious to me that you can have full
cryptographic guarantees that a hardware
wallet provides in the phone form
factor. Like in fact, all the technology
to implement a trust zone and to keep
your secret keys stored in an enclave,
all that stuff was built years before
Bitcoin for DRM of all things
to keep people from stealing like
Netflix or whatever. Phones implement
all this technology to to prevent any
kind of data snooping and maintain
encryption from all the way from the
deepest secure enclave to the display.
Um so it was just obvious to me oh why
don't we embed hardware wallet directly
into the phone. Um that was
[clears throat] the idea so we can make
it as good of a from a security
perspective like you get cold wallets to
wallet guarantees in your hardware
device in terms of the kind of security
that you get but the user experience of
Apple Pay so you get so you can have a
hot wallet that is both secure and and
great for consumers. That was that's
part of it. The other part of it is that
you have these very mature companies
like Google and Apple that have a 20%
rake on all digital spend at least
through their economies.
>> And there's no it's it's just like
that's a a bug in capitalism that just
doesn't make sense. Why isn't it
converging down to the lowest cost? So
to me it's an opportunity to use crypto
as a wedge because developers don't want
to pay these fees. So we can use a
different economics where you pay you
you we can earn I think as good of
returns as Google or Apple but through
effectively trading transaction fees
that are volume based
>> protection. Solana a salana YouTube
replacement like you know an Odyssey
equivalent on Salana.
>> Uh there's people trying to build
crypto-based content creation. Um none
of those I think have really taken off
or proven out. I think that's that's a
harder problem than I think software and
like kind of software experiences. Um
just the amount of sheer content that
you need to generate to get that like
10% as good as like within like a margin
of error as entertaining as YouTube or
Tik Tok is just astronomical. But I
think with AI and Sora like you're going
to see that kind of change. It's just
think about
>> that's actually the the crux of my
question. Does Sora 2 or whatever is
next
>> change the math or not? Cuz yeah, you're
totally right.
>> I think so. But like you need like right
now it's not good enough and too
expensive, but like you can see it in 5
years. Oh, this entertainment stream
that I'm getting, right? The infinite
just of like
of of stream of of entertainment is
going to be AI generated. And that's
kind of a scary thought because I think
humans in the loop on what keeps us
entertaining is probably an important
part of our shared cultural experience.
But uh we'll see what happens.
>> An amazing future ahead.
>> Gentlemen,
I I'm I'm jealous of your seeker, Salem.
[laughter]
>> Um I'm moving I'm starting to move all
my crypto onto it. And by the way, um,
uh, totally my whole community wants to
move our NFT collection onto Salana. So
awesome. I may ping you about that.
>> Awesome.
>> Time for a closing question. Do I get
one question, but I have one that I
think the audience might really care
about. So So totally, uh, if the world
moves all these transactions to Salana,
you know, because it's a thousand times
faster than than Ethereum, which is a
thousand times slower than Bitcoin. So
it's like it is like the engine for AI.
Um, and the the fundamental use of the
Solana token is anti-PAP, right? It's a
way to pay for your your transaction to
get settled.
>> Is there any way to translate the value
of Solana without giving investment
advice?
>> Uh, the the transaction volume of Salana
to the value of the Solana token. How
what's the math that connects those two
things?
>> I think the transaction volume is less
important and what's more important is
the opportunity cost of being late. So
the where the network actually makes
more value like you as a block producer
like you need soul to stake to be a
block producer because if you had no
civil resistance you could create
infinite blocks and that would
effectively spam the network to death.
So you have some civil mechanism to
prevent infinite block producers. So you
have some amount of percentage solely
you stake that gives you x amount of
percent blocks you can make. When you're
making blocks, people are paying you to
be first in the block, to be first to
get access to this trade. So, the amount
that they're willing to pay you is based
on the opportunity cost of that of being
first.
>> Right. Right. And
>> so, so has anyone put together a blog or
a white paper or something that says
like, well,
>> yeah, B blocks probably has done the
best job in terms of compiling all of
this data and analyzing it into more
traditional this is revenue, these are
network costs. So if you go to block
works, you can look at Salana and
Ethereum and do comparisons. And this is
true for all proof ofstake networks
because the civil mechanism for proof of
stake is the token itself and you get
have x percentage stake. You can
literally do I have a portfolio. Do I
put a percentage of it into treasury
bills that are risk- free or do I risk
some of it to run a block producer and
get like tips effectively for including
transactions and it doesn't actually
matter that you're getting tips in soul
or USDC or somebody gives you a sack of
potatoes because the fact that you have
to stake x amount to get access to that
revenue is how you can do your like
Kelly optimized allocation. So this is
ties to you know the intelligent
investor like a very traditional boring
approach to do analysis here. Um you
can't do this for bitcoin because
because the civil mechanism for bitcoin
is energy and I don't know if it'll ever
change or anything like that. So I think
Bitcoin is its own special snowflake
that I have struggled to come up with a
standard model to analyze but for proof
ofstake networks I think you can really
put them in the um intelligent investor
box and do analysis and kind of make
your own decisions.
>> Alex want to give you a chance to ask a
question then I I have a question I go
around the table uh to ask everybody.
>> I'll ask a fun question uh not a serious
question. So, so totally let's project
forward say humanity does in the end
take apart our solar system to build the
Dyson swarm uh and we have lot lots of
computium
what what will be the medium of commerce
in in a Dyson swarm future for humanity
>> do you think that uh this is kind of
like the central planning communism
problem is it computationally feasible
to solve it uh just mathematically
without markets um
>> at at relatively high latencies, right?
You're you're bound by light speed
latencies just like we all are.
>> I think this is this is kind of the
question. How many cubits do we have to
be able to solve this like massive like
linear algebra problem, right? Like can
you allocate the resources to everything
and you might not need commerce. Then
that might be the end of like [snorts]
capitalism and you might only have it
just simply for human entertainment. But
um I think like personal freedoms are
far more important than efficiency in a
lot of ways. So I would like I would go
against I would be very much against it.
I think it's very important for people
to have purpose and competing for tokens
whatever they are right bananas out of a
memecoin or whatever. I think this this
something.
[laughter and clears throat]
>> So here's here's my question for the
group. Go around the horn here. Um,
you're you want to follow on Alex's
question from earlier, which is what's
your definition of wealth in the future?
Sem, what do you think?
Cuz it's very different looking back
historically at the kings and queens and
pharaohs. It was, you know, how many how
many slaves you owned than your ability
to, you know, sort of have access to
agriculture was sort of wealth.
>> What do you think is in the future here?
I would think it's a combination of time
and health span.
>> Time and health span. Okay. Uh Dave,
>> I think it's a no-brainer that it's
purely tied to compute because, you
know, I was asking class at MIT the
other day, like if I offered you $10,000
cash, here it is. Or a GPU that's worth
$30,000. How many of you would take the
GPU? And they're like, are you crazy?
I'll take the 10,000 cash. But in the in
the near-term future, compute can be
immediately turned into cash. I mean
there the the compute is the universal
thing and and when you have AI agents
who are the laborers of the world, the
your number of you know workers is the
amount of compute that you have. So your
ability to make yourself happy whether
it's controlling your figure robot,
cleaning your house or building
something virtual or your customer, it's
all bounded by the amount of compute you
have access to. So that that becomes the
the universal and that that also
determines your health. If you put your
compute towards analyzing your scans, it
determines whether or not it finds your
cancer and so it becomes your health
too. So it becomes the universal
>> foundation. I compute your answer. Alex
>> WG, what's your
>> I think we're we're suffering from the
cliche of of the blind philosophers who
are touching different parts of the
elephant and and all overconfident that
the part of the elephant that they're
feeling is what an elephant feels like.
So, so I'd argue for a more general
definition that generalizes all of those
definitions. I I would argue real wealth
will be measured to first order as
future freedom of action, which
generalizes compute. It generalizes
physical resources. Uh it can be
measured in units of bits. So, it's an
information theoretic definition, but
it's not just about compute. It it's
about the ability, some might call it
empowerment, but that that's a
specialized term, to to take the course
of action you want in the future, not
just in the present.
>> I I knew I should
>> The first time Alex said that to me, I I
didn't get it.
>> And but if you go to alexw.org and you
read his his paper on the topic and you
you read it closely, you'll come away
saying, "Oh my god, he's totally right."
>> Yeah. I I knew I should not I should
have
>> degrees of freedom.
>> Yeah,
>> degrees of freedom. Yeah. It's the same
thing. Yeah. you guys.
>> I should have gone before Alex went. I
I'll I'll I'll I'll answer and then uh
you know I think it's the ability to
fulfill your desires um your purpose and
you know compute is part of it but
nanotechnology is going to be a
fundamental as well of manipulation of
the physical universe. So it's not just
compute um in that regard and and
totally
>> thinking in scarcity terms. You got to
jump forward to abundance terms and
think then all that matters is time and
health span. Hello.
>> I think you're you're thinking in
meatbody terms. Think in post-biological
terms. Come on. [laughter]
>> All right.
>> Uh anyway totally. So uh your your
answer here
>> degrees of freedom.
>> Degrees of freedom. All right. which is
like I think people will never feel
satisfied because there's somebody else
that has more degrees of freedom than
them. So this is like the human
condition is always striving for
something else.
>> The the hedonic treadmill spins faster
and faster, doesn't it?
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> Yeah. I think you guys are right cuz you
can have a lot of compute and still be
beaten like a dog every day by some
government that Yeah. So you guys are
right. [laughter]
>> All right. [gasps] We've we've reached
we've reached a conclusion here. Uh
Tuli, where do people find you? Um in
the world
>> on Axe on Axe A Yakaveno.
>> Um yeah, follow me on Axe. I have hot
takes, sometimes boring takes, I don't
know. [laughter]
>> Love it. Love it.
>> Or not. Yeah. Thank you for the work
that you're doing. Uh thank you for the
future that you're enabling for so many
globally around the world. Uh grateful.
The only time more exciting in today is
tomorrow and uh it's going to be a woozy
of a decade ahead. Moonshot mates, I
love you all. Thank you for today.
