# Scientists Finally Revealed How Plants Really Think

**Channel**: OMNI
**Published**: 2026-02-02
**Duration**: 50m 51s
**URL**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb42OQ_hwc4

## Description (no transcript available)

This is the story of how we discovered intelligence doesn’t need a brain – how plants built the first network on Earth, and what that means for consciousness itself. 

ABOUT OMNI
Stories about life, matter, and the mystery in between. Omni is a cinematic science channel dedicated to exploring the hidden beauty of biology and the fundamental questions of existence. We create long-form documentaries that reveal the patterns, processes, and phenomena most people never get to see.

From the microscopic to the cosmic, from evolutionary adaptations to the nature of consciousness itself; we transform complex science into visual narratives that feel like discovery, not lecture.
Every film asks: what have we been missing? What does life look like when you truly see it?
