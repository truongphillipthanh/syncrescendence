# -SOVEREIGN

**Sovereign Decision Queue** — Items requiring Phillip's direct judgment, approval, or action that Ajna cannot execute autonomously.

Files here represent blocking decisions, external actions, or choices that need human authority.

---

## How This Works
- Ajna triages items here when they exceed autonomous scope
- Each file is a self-contained decision brief with context, options, and recommendation
- Once decided, Phillip marks status → Ajna executes and archives
- Items are dated and prioritized
