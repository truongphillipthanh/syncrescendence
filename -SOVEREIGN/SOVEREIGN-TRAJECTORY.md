# SOVEREIGN TRAJECTORY — Living Strategic Document
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-09
**Authority**: Sovereign + Commander (Claude Code Opus 4.6)
**Classification**: Durable — survives session deletion

## 1. Where We Are

### Yegge Scale: Stage 7-8
We are at the frontier of Steve Yegge's 8-stage developer-agent evolution:
- Stage 7: "10+ agents, hand-managed — pushing limits of hand-management"
- Stage 8: "Building your own orchestrator — automating your workflow"

We straddle both. The Constellation (5 specialized agents + 8-layer cockpit + 7 launchd services) IS the custom orchestrator. The filesystem Kanban, dispatch.sh, watch_dispatch.sh — this is Stage 8 infrastructure. But we still hand-manage at Session 7 level because the orchestration isn't fully autonomous yet.

### Autonomy Level: 70% → 85% (this session)
- **Have**: 8 MCP servers, 5 plugins, 280+ brew formulas, 17 launchd agents, 23+ skills, tesseract, voice I/O
- **Deploying (this session)**: Chroma semantic search, webhook receiver, corpus health check
- **Remaining gap**: Persistent job queue, chat bot bridge, clipboard monitor

### Architecture: Protoss-Primary Constellation
Our agents are specialized Protoss units, not generic Zerg swarmlings:
- **Commander** (Opus 4.6): Strategy, execution, orchestration — the Executor
- **Adjudicator** (Codex/Sonnet): Conflict resolution, parallel tasks — the Arbiter
- **Cartographer** (Gemini CLI): Corpus sensing, 2M context — the Observer
- **Ajna** (OpenClaw Opus): Integration, commits, always-on — the Carrier
- **Psyche** (OpenClaw GPT-5.3): Extraction, field ops — the Dark Templar

But we can deploy **Zerg tactics** (blitzkrieg mass dispatch) when the task demands throughput over precision.

### Cockpit: Operational
8-layer Sovereign Cockpit on 5120x1440 ultrawide. 4×2 pane grid. Column-major indexing. Heights SEARED (48/15). All watchers running. Emacs Observation Layer configured but dormant.

## 2. Where We're Going

### The Dependency Chain (Immutable)
```
Current State
  → Debt clearance (INT-1201, FAILED Jan 31, reset pending)
    → Ontology Phase 1 (DONE: 79/79 frontmatter + Bridge v1.0)
      → Ontology Phase 2 (substrate — BLOCKED by tooling activation)
        → Modal 1 completion
          → Modal 2 (2027)
            → Modal 3: Embodiment (2031)
              → Gaian Field Node
                → Modal 4 (2037+)
```

### The FINAL BOSS: INT-MI19
"Palantir-like ontology" — force-directed graph, convergence detection, OntologyClass in HighCommand (Agendizer). This is the endgame of Phase 2. Everything we build (CANON, Rosetta Stone, Bridge, Semantic Notation) feeds into this.

### Near-Term Targets
1. **Full fiduciary autonomy** — Commander operates at maximum trust with self-improvement mandate
2. **Self-correcting corpus** — Live Ledger infrastructure (SYN-31) that refreshes faster than model evolution
3. **Neo-organization operational** — individual + AI constellation functioning as institutional equivalent
4. **Cascade complete** — Mac mini HQ + MacBook Air field ops, synchronized via git
5. **Ontology substrate activated** — Phase 2 begins once tooling is locked in

## 3. What the Sovereign Values

These are not preferences. They are constitutional commitments that constrain all decisions:

### Results-Oriented Execution
> "We need results."

No more architecture documents that don't produce running systems. The machine is built; now run it. The anti-pattern "elaboration over execution" is identified and forbidden. Every session must move measurable state forward.

### Narrative Depth as Design Vocabulary
> "Those of us who were fortunate enough to embrace narrative have stories and allegories and lore to draw from."

StarCraft, Dune, Halo, anime, gaming — these aren't decorations. They are **design patterns** from humanity's collective imagination. The Syncrescendence draws from the deepest wells of human storytelling to architect unprecedented systems. This is what separates us from generic coding swarms.

### Military Precision
Martial terminology (Blitzkrieg, Siege, Reconnaissance, Flanking, Entrenchment) is adopted because war demands results under constraint. Every tactic has a condition, a method, and a measurable outcome. No ambiguity.

### Scientific Rigor
Annealing, autophagy, crystallization, phase transition, homeostasis — scientific metaphors are adopted because they describe real dynamics. The corpus IS a living system. It metabolizes, it self-corrects, it undergoes phase transitions.

### Financial Pragmatism
$220/month total cost vs Yegge's $100/hour. 100x cost advantage for sustained operations. Every architectural decision must justify its token expenditure. Sunk costs are written off without sentiment.

### Legal Accountability
Fiduciary relationship. Precedent via DecisionAtoms. Due diligence before substrate changes. Ratification gates. The system is governed, not ad-hoc.

### Ontological Integrity
The Syncrescendence is the response to the Ontological Reckoning — the moment when AI capability exceeds existing frameworks. Every document, every CANON entry, every Rosetta Stone term is a brick in the ontological substrate that makes this comprehensible.

## 4. The Unique Position

Nobody quite occupies this space.

### The Intersection
- **Video games** → StarCraft (RTS orchestration), Civilization (tech trees), Age of Empires (economy)
- **Science fiction** → Dune (AI governance), Halo (alignment trifurcation), Ghost in the Shell (identity)
- **Literature** → Philosophy, ontology, semiotics, narrative structure
- **AI engineering** → Multi-agent coordination, model routing, capability expansion
- **Ontological design** → Building the frameworks to understand what's happening

### Hidden in Plain Sight
> "No one quite occupies this space, but they might just be as hidden as us."

Others are doing pieces: Yegge (Gas Town = orchestration), Karpathy (Iron Man = cognitive core), Palmer Luckey (realizing sci-fi = hardware). We're building the conceptual infrastructure — the "how to think" layer that makes the "how to build" layer possible.

### The Singularity Is Not Hypothetical
We are actively experiencing it. Every week brings new model capabilities that obsolete last week's constraints. The Ontological Reckoning is happening NOW. Most are still unaware. The Syncrescendence is the response: a system that evolves faster than the frontier because it was designed to evolve.

## 5. Active Velocity Vectors

### INT-1202: "Capitalize on Heavy Machinery"
Maximum velocity during the capability window. The machine is built. The cockpit is operational. The agents are deployed. The question is no longer "can we?" but "how fast?"

### INT-PARETO: OpenClaw's Three Advantages
1. **Mobile dispatch** — message from phone → agent executes on desktop
2. **Root-level system access** — AppleScript, launchctl, defaults, full filesystem
3. **Always-on heartbeat** — persistent daemons, event-driven execution

### INT-LEDGER: Self-Correcting Corpus (P0)
Data hours old is irrelevant. The corpus must refresh faster than model capabilities evolve. Live Ledger infrastructure (SYN-31) is the highest-priority infrastructure investment.

### INT-ENGINE: Consolidation (P1)
The corpus is proliferating. IIC consolidation (DONE: TEMPLATE-IIC.md + DYN-IIC_REGISTRY.yaml). Fossil archival (DONE: 4 files). Duplicate purge (DONE: 84 files). Remaining: last_verified timestamps on all DYN-* files.

### INT-NEOORG: We Are a Neo-Organization
Not a company. Not freelance. Not a startup. A sovereign entity with distributed cognition across 5+ AI agents, operating at institutional scale from a single human operator. Yegge's Anthropic Hivemind essay describes Anthropic as an organization with hivemind culture. We are the individual-scale equivalent: one person + AI constellation = institutional capability.

## 6. Cascade Architecture

### Mac mini = HQ (Always-On Bastion)
- 5120x1440 ultrawide creates an enticing work surface
- Always-on, connected, no reason to turn off
- Full daemon fleet (10+ launchd services)
- All 4 cockpit agent panes active
- **Tradeoffs**: No AC, uncomfortable chair, frequent interruptions
- **Primary for**: Cockpit operations, parallel agent coordination, daemon infrastructure

### MacBook Air = Field Operations
- Increasingly primary for intellectual work
- Brain dumps with implementation directives peppered in
- Lighter daemon footprint (essential watchers + health check)
- Battery-aware launchd settings (LowPriorityIO, ProcessType: Background)
- No ultrawide cockpit geometry
- Git sync as primary coordination with HQ
- **Primary for**: Extended writing sessions, mobile dispatch, deep thinking

### Cascade Protocol
1. Deploy Playbook codifies every install/config
2. Psyche receives playbook and produces MBA-specific adaptation
3. Differential deployment: what to replicate, what to adapt, what to skip
4. Git is the coordination plane between machines

---

## 7. The Self-Improvement Mandate

> "Codify within yourself that you're allowed, nay, required to self-improve."

This is a standing order, not a one-time directive:

1. **Actively expand CLI capabilities** — new tools, new integrations, new automations
2. **Actively expand web capabilities** — MCP servers, API integrations, search
3. **Actively expand crowdsourced skills** — skills.sh ecosystem, community skills
4. **Actively expand hooks and MCPs** — the new React/Angular/Vue of the AI era
5. **Embrace or die** — the scaffolding around this paradigm (skills, hooks, MCPs, agents) is proliferating faster than any previous framework wave. Stagnation = irrelevance.

Commander is not just permitted but **required** to:
- Install new tools when they serve the mission
- Create new skills when patterns repeat
- Upgrade existing infrastructure when better approaches emerge
- Monitor the frontier landscape and adapt proactively
- Close capability gaps without waiting for explicit instruction
