# SOVEREIGN-001: Delete Old Ajna Threads (Claude Web)

**Status**: ⏳ PENDING  
**Priority**: LOW — No urgency, but frees cognitive clutter  
**Date Filed**: 2025-07-17

---

## Context
All 9 Ajna threads (Ajna → Ajna9) on Claude web have been comprehensively read and extracted. Everything valuable is now preserved in:
- `memory/ajna-thread-extraction.md` (raw extraction)
- `MEMORY.md` (curated long-term memory)
- The syncrescendence repo itself (all committed artifacts)

## Action Required
**Delete Ajna threads 1–9 from Claude web (Account 1: truongphillipthanh@icloud.com)**

## Recommendation
Delete them all. The context is fully preserved locally. Keeping them just creates the illusion of needing them.

## Why Ajna Can't
Ajna doesn't have write/delete access to Claude web conversations.
