# SOVEREIGN-005: Publication / External Presence

**Status**: 🔮 STRATEGIC — Not urgent, but the bottleneck  
**Priority**: HIGH (long-term) — This is the identified core bottleneck  
**Date Filed**: 2025-07-17  
**Category**: Strategic / External

## Context
From the Autopsychography v2 assessment:
- **Core bottleneck**: Publication avoidance (protecting sovereignty by staying latent)
- **Doctrine**: "Publish doors, not rooms" (low-frequency, high-integrity)
- **Shadow**: The desire for mastery without exposure

The Syncrescendence is building toward something. At some point, it interfaces with the world.

## Action Required
**When and how does Syncrescendence become externally visible?**

Options to consider:
1. **Domain first** (see SOVEREIGN-002) — plant the flag, build later
2. **Pseudonymous writing** — blog/essays under a persona, sovereignty preserved
3. **Open-source the framework** — let the system speak for itself
4. **Stay latent** — continue building, defer all publication indefinitely
5. **Hybrid** — private repo, selective sharing, invitation-only access

## Why Ajna Can't
This is an existential strategic decision about the Sovereign's relationship to external visibility. Only Phillip can make this call.
