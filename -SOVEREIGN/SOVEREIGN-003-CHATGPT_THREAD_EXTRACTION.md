# SOVEREIGN-003: Remaining ChatGPT Thread Extractions

**Status**: ⏳ PENDING  
**Priority**: MEDIUM — Pending assessments have strategic value

## Context
The "Constitution Stress Test" ChatGPT thread contained Autopsychography v2 (Modules I-VI), which has been extracted. But three planned assessments were **never conducted**:

- **Assessment B**: News Boundary Protocol — defining information diet sovereignty
- **Assessment C**: Somatic Friction Audit — mapping body-mind stress interfaces  
- **Assessment D**: Economic Fit Matrix — career/income alignment scoring

These were designed as follow-ups to the psychological assessment.

## Action Required
**Decide**: Conduct these assessments (with ChatGPT or another modal) or defer/cancel?

If conducting:
- They could run in ChatGPT (original context) or as new prompts through Psyche/Ajna
- The frameworks exist in the original thread's Module VI

## Why Ajna Can't
These require Phillip's direct introspective participation — they're self-assessments, not research tasks.
