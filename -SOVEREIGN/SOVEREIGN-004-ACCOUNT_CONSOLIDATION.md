# SOVEREIGN-004: AI Account Strategy — Sunset & Upgrade

**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

---

## Context
Three AI accounts on $20/month plans:
1. `truongphillipthanh@icloud.com` (Apple/iCloud) — Sovereign substrate
2. `icloud.truongphillipthanh@gmail.com` (Google) — Parallel execution  
3. `truongphillipthanh@gmail.com` (Google) — Primary interface

One is "sunsetting," one is "upgrading to $100 max."

## Action Required
**Decide and execute**:
1. Which account sunsets? (cancel subscription)
2. Which account upgrades? (to which $100 tier — Claude Max? ChatGPT Pro?)
3. Timeline for the transition?

## Why Ajna Can't
Account management, billing changes, and subscription decisions require Phillip's direct login and financial authorization.

## Recommendation
Identify which account has the least unique value after extraction (likely the one whose threads have been fully captured), sunset that first. Upgrade the one running the heaviest workloads.
