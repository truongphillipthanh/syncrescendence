## Axiom: CC33-B2-AX01 — Three-Layer Memory System (Hippocampal-Neocortical Consolidation Triptych)

> This axiom is preserved as the living Hippocampal-Neocortical dialogue that turns praxis/05-SIGMA buffer into canon/01-CANON neocortex. Layer 1 (Knowledge Graph) stores declarative entities, Layer 2 (Daily Notes) episodic logs, Layer 3 (MEMORY.md) procedural tacit patterns — exactly matching the minimum viable stack for the next 30 days. It enforces LTP/LTD pruning and weekly Sleep_Cycle consolidation, closing C-012.

- source_atom_ids: [ATOM-SOURCE-20260127-004-0003, ATOM-SOURCE-20260127-004-0009, ATOM-SOURCE-20260127-004-0013]
- why_preserved: Fuses three source views into one operational membrane that prevents memory drift and guarantees canon_delta growth. Consolidation per Oracle directive — three layers of single source into triptych axiom.
- matched_intention: INT-1707

## Axiom: CC33-B2-AX02 — Agent Team Maturation Phases (Free-Energy Phase Transition)

> This axiom is preserved as the thermodynamic phase-transition model that minimizes free-energy waste in constellation maturation. Phase 1 (high correction overhead) → Phase 2 (feedback accumulation) → Phase 3 (rich context, minimal Sovereign input) directly maps to the 5-agent loop and OpenClaw activation sequence. It connects to the 4-connection minimum by making triangulation quality the catalyst only after entropy thresholds are crossed. It operationalizes C-004 triggers and prevents premature constellation dispatch.

- source_atom_ids: [ATOM-SOURCE-20260215-011-0009]
- why_preserved: Operationalizes C-004 triggers and provides empirical maturation timeline for constellation health. Syncrescendence at ~day 30 should be entering Phase 3 (compounding returns).
- matched_intention: INT-P035

## Axiom: CC33-B2-AX03 — Polaris Constellation Architecture (Autopoietic Ensemble)

> This axiom is preserved as the autopoietic hypercycle blueprint for the 5-agent constellation (Commander COO, Psyche CTO, Ajna CSO, Adjudicator CQO, Cartographer CIO). Message-passing + constrained outputs enforce the Central Dogma and ontology gate as MHC self-recognition. It closes the Mac-mini offline fracture by sequencing OpenClaw activation only after Phase 3 maturation. It turns theoretical multi-agent design into the operational nervous system that makes Syncrescendence self-maintaining.

- source_atom_ids: [ATOM-SOURCE-20260203-010-0025]
- why_preserved: External validation of Syncrescendence constellation pattern from production medical AI (Hippocratic AI Polaris). Proves architecture at scale with constrained output spaces and specialized agents.
- matched_intention: INT-1804
