## Axiom: CC33-B2-AX04 — Three-Layer Memory System as Architectural Blueprint

> The Three-Layer Memory System upgrades Clawdbot's memory into a self-maintaining, compounding knowledge graph, consisting of Layer 1: Knowledge Graph (/life/areas/) for entities with atomic facts and living summaries, Layer 2: Daily Notes (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md) for raw event logs, and Layer 3: Tacit Knowledge (MEMORY.md) for patterns, preferences, and lessons learned.

- source_atom_ids: [ATOM-SOURCE-20260127-004-0003]
- terminal_domain: STR
- drift_score: 0.03
- axiom_alignment_score: 0.92
- matched_intention: INT-1707
- why_preserved: Architectural blueprint for the three-layer memory stack that maps directly to agents/*/memory/ structure. Extends AX02 (Hippocampal-Neocortical consolidation) with the concrete layer taxonomy. Canonicalizing completes the memory architecture specification.

## Axiom: CC33-B2-AX05 — Knowledge Graph as Declarative Entity Store

> Layer 1 of the Three-Layer Memory System, the Knowledge Graph, organizes meaningful entities (people, companies, projects) into folders, each containing atomic facts in `items.json` and living summaries in `summary.md`.

- source_atom_ids: [ATOM-SOURCE-20260127-004-0009]
- terminal_domain: STR
- drift_score: 0.04
- axiom_alignment_score: 0.89
- matched_intention: INT-1707
- why_preserved: Specifies Layer 1 implementation pattern (entity folders + atomic facts + living summaries). Maps to the Graphiti integration target and the entity/ subdirectories in agent memory. Provides the concrete schema for declarative memory.

## Axiom: CC33-B2-AX06 — Tacit Knowledge as Procedural Pattern Memory

> Layer 3 of the Three-Layer Memory System, Tacit Knowledge (`MEMORY.md`), captures how the user operates, including work habits, contact preferences, and lessons learned, distinguishing these as facts about the user rather than facts about the world.

- source_atom_ids: [ATOM-SOURCE-20260127-004-0013]
- terminal_domain: STR
- drift_score: 0.03
- axiom_alignment_score: 0.91
- matched_intention: INT-1707
- why_preserved: Formalizes the distinction between world-knowledge (Layer 1) and self-knowledge (Layer 3). This IS the praxis/ vs canon/ distinction — praxis captures operational patterns (how we work), canon captures verified knowledge (what is true). Canonicalizing anchors the memory architecture's philosophical foundation.

## Axiom: CC33-B2-AX07 — Agent Team Maturation as Phase Transition Model

> AI agent teams typically progress through three phases: Phase 1 (Mediocre everything, days 1-7) with generic output and high correction overhead; Phase 2 (Specific competence, days 8-21) with feedback accumulation and output improvements; and Phase 3 (Compounding returns, day 22+) with rich context and minimal changes needed.

- source_atom_ids: [ATOM-SOURCE-20260215-011-0009]
- terminal_domain: PROTO
- drift_score: 0.06
- axiom_alignment_score: 0.86
- matched_intention: INT-P035
- why_preserved: Provides the empirical maturation timeline for agent teams. Syncrescendence constellation is at ~day 30 — should be entering Phase 3 (compounding returns). Canonicalizing gives a measurable benchmark for constellation health and sets expectations for new agent onboarding.

## Axiom: CC33-B2-AX08 — Constellation Architecture as Specialized Agent Ensemble

> The "constellation architecture" from Hippocratic AI's Polaris system uses multiple specialized agents (Primary Agent and Support Agents) for healthcare LLMs, employing message-passing, iterative co-training, and control-flow logic with constrained output spaces.

- source_atom_ids: [ATOM-SOURCE-20260203-010-0025]
- terminal_domain: STR
- drift_score: 0.05
- axiom_alignment_score: 0.88
- matched_intention: INT-1804
- why_preserved: External validation of Syncrescendence's constellation pattern from production medical AI. Polaris proves the architecture at scale with constrained output spaces (our Ontology Gate) and specialized agents (our 5-agent constellation). Canonicalizing anchors the architecture in peer-reviewed precedent.
