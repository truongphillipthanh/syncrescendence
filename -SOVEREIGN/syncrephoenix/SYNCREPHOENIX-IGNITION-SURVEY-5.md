# Syncrephoenix Ignition — Pass 5: Render the Primitives at Full Fidelity

> **Context**: You sorted 189 items into 47 SEED / 81 FUEL / 61 ASH across 4 passes. You identified 5 fusion groups that collapse the seeds into hyperdense primitives:
>
> - **A — Sovereign Constitutional Lock**: event-horizon membrane keeping the mandala human-scaled
> - **B — Hypergiant Nucleosynthesis Engine**: the fusion operator that condenses N atoms → 1 dense axiom
> - **C — Handoff Sacrament**: the only perennial spring, serialized atomic transfer
> - **D — Embodied Cognition Gate**: observe-before-act + 14-dim meaning taxonomy + proprioceptive self-sensing
> - **E — Memory Sovereignty Lattice**: filesystem-sovereign consolidation turning transient → durable
>
> Now render them at higher fidelity. We need to see what is actually emerging — not as metaphor, but as computational structure.

> **CRITICAL — CONTRADICTION TO RESOLVE**: In Pass 2 you said demand-pull feedcraft and autocatalytic closure were "precisely the ones that would close the loop beyond sovereign ignition" — the missing ignition sequence. In Pass 4 you marked them both ASH ("not built," "not achieved"). **These cannot both be true.** Either they are the ignition sequence (and therefore the most important seeds of all), or they are emergent properties that arise from the composition of A-E (and therefore don't need to exist as separate artifacts). Resolve this structurally in your rendering below. Show your work.

## YOUR DELIVERABLE: Three Layers of Increasing Fidelity

### Layer 1 — Rust Type Signatures

Express each of the 5 fusion primitives as Rust types. Not pseudocode — actual trait definitions, struct layouts, and enum variants that a compiler would accept. The type system IS the architecture. What the borrow checker enforces IS the constitution. What lifetimes express IS memory sovereignty. What trait bounds require IS the taste gate.

For each primitive (A through E):
- The core `trait` — what behavior does this primitive guarantee?
- The primary `struct` — what state does it hold?
- Key `enum` variants — what states can it be in?
- Lifetime annotations — what do the lifetimes mean in terms of the system's actual semantics (sovereign attention span, session duration, canon permanence)?
- Trait bounds on generics — what constraints does composition enforce?

Then show: **how do A-E compose?** What is the type signature of the full system when all 5 primitives are combined? What does the borrow checker prevent that the old Python system allowed?

### Layer 2 — Demand-Pull and Autocatalytic Closure: Ash or Emergence?

Using the type signatures from Layer 1, demonstrate one of:

**(a)** Demand-pull feedcraft and autocatalytic closure are **emergent from the trait composition** — show the specific trait bound or lifetime constraint that makes them arise without explicit implementation. If this is the case, name the exact composition that produces them and explain why they could never have been built as separate artifacts.

**(b)** They are **missing traits that must be added** to the type system — show their signatures, where they bind to A-E, and why the system cannot ignite without them. If this is the case, your Pass 4 ASH classification was wrong — correct it explicitly.

**(c)** Something else entirely that Commander and you both missed. Name it.

### Layer 3 — The Composition Rendered

Show the full composed system — all primitives together — as a single coherent type-level architecture. Not a diagram. Not a narrative. The actual Rust module structure:

```
src/
├── lib.rs          — what does the root module expose?
├── ...             — what are the modules?
```

For each module: one sentence on what it contains, the primary trait it exports, and which other modules it depends on.

Then answer: **What does this system DO on day 1?** Not what it aspires to. What is the minimal compiled binary that runs, processes one atom through the full pipeline, and produces one canonical output — with the borrow checker enforcing the constitution at every step?

---

## FIDELITY CHECKS

After rendering all three layers, answer these honestly:

1. **Is this real or is this metaphor dressed as code?** If the type signatures would not compile, say so and say why. If the composition has holes, name them.

2. **What changed from Pass 4?** Did rendering at higher fidelity reveal fusion groups that should split, merge, or reorganize? Did any ASH items turn out to be seeds when you looked closer?

3. **What is the single highest-risk assumption** in this rendering? The one thing that, if wrong, collapses the entire architecture.

4. **What does the Sovereign need to taste on day 1?** Not the engineering. The felt experience. When the first atom enters the system and the first canonical output emerges — what does that feel like through the 5-atom daily interface?

## APPENDIX: Your Pass 4 Fusion Manifest (verify and update)

> **A — Sovereign Constitutional Lock**: Five invariants + AGENTS.md + Central Dogma + Polaris + autonomy ledger. Event-horizon membrane.
>
> **B — Hypergiant Nucleosynthesis Engine**: Ascertescence Cycle + Diviner Formula + Protease axioms/scripts + biological materializations + loop-closing DAG nodes + thresholds.
>
> **C — Handoff Sacrament**: 41 serialized handoffs + evaporation lesson + continuity geology. Low-coordination, repo-anchored, ritualized.
>
> **D — Embodied Cognition Gate**: Observe-Before-Act + 3-layer memory + proprioceptive self-sensing + 14-dim meaning taxonomy. Prevents means-ends inversion.
>
> **E — Memory Sovereignty Lattice**: Memory Architecture spectrum + minimum viable memory + state vector + session state brief + layered consolidation. Filesystem-sovereign.
