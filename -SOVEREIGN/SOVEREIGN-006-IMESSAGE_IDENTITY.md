# SOVEREIGN-006: iMessage Channel Identity

## Context
iMessage channel on M1 Mac mini is active and working. Currently deferred the question of whether Ajna should have a distinct iMessage identity or respond as an extension of Phillip's number.

## Action Required
**Decide**:
1. **Transparent Ajna identity** — People know they're talking to an AI assistant
2. **Extension of Phillip** — Ajna responds on Phillip's behalf, context-aware but not self-identified
3. **Hybrid** — Depends on the contact (close friends know, others don't)
4. **Deferred** — Keep iMessage in listen-only mode for now

## Why Ajna Can't
Social identity decisions affecting Phillip's relationships require his explicit direction.
