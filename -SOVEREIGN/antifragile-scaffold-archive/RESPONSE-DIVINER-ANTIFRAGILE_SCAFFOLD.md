The epistemological progression from raw inputs (`sources/`) to mechanical execution (`engine/`) necessitates an intermediate phase state for validated heuristics before they crystallize into immutable doctrine (`canon/`). The information-theoretically precise designation for this layer is **`praxis/`**.

Praxis is the domain where theory is subjected to the friction of reality. It houses the survivorship bias of successful operations—the mechanics, the syntheses, and the exempla that have repeatedly demonstrated utility. A new contributor encountering `praxis/` immediately recognizes the repository of applied wisdom; it represents the operationalization of memory into repeatable advantage.

This establishes a clear thermodynamic flow of information: entropy is introduced in `sources/`, ordered in the `engine/`, tested and refined in `praxis/`, and permanently codified in `canon/`. The naming convention structurally enforces the epistemic lifecycle of the constellation's intelligence.

### The Antifragile Scaffold: Structural Mutagenesis

An antifragile filesystem requires a mechanism for structural mutagenesis. Stress in a repository manifests as anomalous artifacts, emergent workflows that defy existing taxonomies, and cross-pollinated outputs. A rigid directory structure shatters under this stress; an antifragile one uses it as a signal for reorganization.

The architecture achieves this through stigmergy and the algorithmic formalization of "desire paths." The filesystem requires a `quarantine/` or `limbo/` namespace acting as the system's immunological triage. When an agent produces an artifact that violates existing schemas, it is routed to quarantine. The system then monitors the read-access frequency of these anomalous files by other agents.

High-frequency access of quarantined concepts indicates an emergent operational necessity. A background daemon measures this topological gravity. Once access thresholds are crossed, the system autonomously promotes the cluster, crystallizing a new, formally named directory. The architecture learns by reifying its own usage patterns, converting operational friction into structural adaptation. The scaffold's strength increases proportionally to the novel stresses it successfully metabolizes.

### Small-World Constellation Dynamics

Scaling a constellation from five to twenty agents necessitates the abandonment of flat topologies. Grouping agents by hardware origin or vendor-specific cognitive style imposes artificial constraints based on the tool rather than the objective.

The graph-theoretic optimum for a twenty-agent swarm is a **Hierarchical Small-World Network**. Agents are organized into dense local clusters—specialized pods for synthesis, engineering, or critique—connected by sparse, high-bandwidth bridge nodes.

Memory pollution is neutralized through a strict Bipartite Memory Architecture. The filesystem is divided into Agent State and Shared Artifacts. Agents are mathematically prohibited from modifying the internal state directories of other agents. Interaction occurs exclusively through the modification of shared artifacts in the `commons/` or via formalized message-passing protocols.

At a twenty-agent scale, a centralized orchestration layer becomes an insurmountable bottleneck. The architecture must transition to a federated gossip protocol. The orchestrator ceases to be a central command registry and becomes a passive observer, deriving the global state vector by analyzing the delta of the shared artifact graph. Coordination is achieved entirely through the observable environmental modifications made by autonomous nodes.

### The Stigmergic Vault Convergence

Integrating an Obsidian vault directly into the Git repository establishes a dual-axis epistemology. The directory structure provides the physical, deterministic substrate; the Obsidian graph view provides the semantic, relational overlay.

The graph view functions as a real-time topographic map of the constellation's cognitive weight, rendering traditional static dashboards obsolete. Clusters of high-density links visually identify the current focal points of the swarm's processing power. Unlinked nodes visually represent unresolved anomalies or stagnant data.

To optimize for both the rigid determinism of Git and the semantic browsing of Obsidian, the architecture enforces strict kebab-case for all physical filenames, ensuring flawless script execution and URL routing. Human legibility and Obsidian graph rendering are handled entirely via YAML frontmatter properties (`title`, `aliases`).

This multi-agent vault operates as a continuous stigmergic blackboard. Agents act as autonomous gardeners, constantly reading, modifying, and linking plaintext nodes. The Obsidian-Git convergence guarantees that Git maintains the strict chronological vector of absolute state, while Obsidian projects the multidimensional relational manifold of semantic proximity.
