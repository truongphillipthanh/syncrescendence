comparison_notes: |
  Claude 4.5 Opus is Anthropic's flagship model, first to exceed 80% on
  SWE-bench Verified. Compared to previous Opus models, it maintains the
  depth and nuance while adding extended thinking capability for complex
  multi-step reasoning.

  Versus GPT-5.2: More consistent prose quality, better code understanding,
  but slightly less real-time knowledge access.

  Versus Gemini 3 Pro: Smaller effective context (200K vs 1M), but higher
  quality synthesis. Opus for depth, Gemini for breadth.

  Within Claude family: Use Opus for strategic sessions, Sonnet for daily
  operations, Haiku for batch tasks.

safety:
  classification: ASL-3
  notes: "Advanced safety level with additional oversight"
