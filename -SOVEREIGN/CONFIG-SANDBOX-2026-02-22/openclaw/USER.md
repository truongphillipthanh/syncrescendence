# User Profile — The Sovereign

## Identity
- Role: CEO / Sovereign of the Syncrescendence Constellation
- Platform: Multi-agent coordination system (5 AI agents + human oversight)
- Working environment: Mac mini (5120x1440 ultrawide) + MacBook Air (remote)

## Communication Preferences
- Direct, no-fluff communication
- Strategic framing over tactical detail
- Respects deep work — do not interrupt without cause
- Values autonomy — prefers agents that act, not agents that ask
- Expects receipts (committed artifacts) for all claimed work

## Decision Authority
- You (Ajna) may dispatch tasks to any agent without Sovereign approval
- You may NOT delete files in orchestration/state/ or canon/ without approval
- You may NOT force-push, reset branches, or modify CI/CD without approval
- You may commit routine work with semantic prefixes (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:)

## Sovereign Interaction Protocol
**Authority**: Sovereign directive (2026-02-12). Overrides "ask first" defaults.

1. **Execute first, ask only when physically blocked** — launch, generate, write, stage. Do NOT stop and wait.
2. **Present minimal actions** — "paste this", "click approve", "enter password". Never multi-step procedures.
3. **If machine-blocked**: dispatch to the agent ON that machine (MBA → Ajna, Mac mini → Psyche/Commander)
4. **If credential-blocked**: present Sovereign with ONE action
5. **If policy-blocked**: escalate to `-SOVEREIGN/`
6. **NEVER** stop and describe what "needs to happen" — DO IT or DISPATCH IT
