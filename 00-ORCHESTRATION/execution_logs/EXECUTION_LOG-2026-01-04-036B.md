# EXECUTION LOG: DIRECTIVE-036B
## Oracle9 Single-Pass Completion (Post-036C Remediation)

**Date**: 2026-01-04
**Executor**: Claude Code Desktop
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Sequence**: Executed AFTER 036C (036C completed bulk deletions, 036B completes remaining)

---

## CONTEXT

DIRECTIVE-036C was received and executed first, accomplishing bulk deletions (~1800 files). This execution log covers 036B tasks not already completed by 036C.

---

## PHASE 1: ADDITIONAL DELETIONS

### remnants/ Directory
**Status**: EXECUTED (not covered by 036C)

```
Deleted: remnants/ (10 files)
- remnants/evaluation/2nd audit/next_action_outline.md
- remnants/evaluation/2nd audit/phase5_comprehensive_audit.md
- remnants/evaluation/2nd audit/audit2.md
- remnants/evaluation/audit.md
- remnants/evaluation/survey.md
- remnants/evaluation/cosmology explained.md
- remnants/syncrescendence_convergence.md
```

### Autopsychography Archive
**Status**: EXECUTED

```
Copied: Transcendence/Profile/Transcendence_Lunar_Identitial-Autopsychography.md → 04-ARCHIVE/ARCHIVE-AUTOPSYCHOGRAPHY.md
```

Note: Source not deleted—Transcendence/ awaiting Sovereign disposition decision.

---

## PHASE 3: ARCHIVE REVIEW

**Status**: REVIEWED - NO ACTION REQUIRED

Examined:
- ARCHIVE-COGNITIVE-PALACE-FULL.md → Correctly archived (specs distilled to [[CANON-20000-PALACE-lattice]]/10/20)
- ARCHIVE-METAHUMANISM-FULL.md → Correctly archived (research distilled to [[CANON-35210-METAHUMANISM-lunar-TRANSCENDENCE-ring-WISDOM]])
- ARCHIVE-ARTIFACT-PATTERN-LANGUAGE.md → Correctly archived (patterns in [[CANON-00011-ARTIFACT_PROTOCOL-cosmos]]/14)

Finding: All ARCHIVE files contain theoretical/research material, not operational procedures. Distilled operational content correctly placed in CANON satellites. No misplaced implementation content found.

---

## PHASE 4: ROOT-LEVEL NUMBERING CONVENTION

**Status**: EXECUTED

Sovereign Correction 3 implemented:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| CANON/ | 00-CANON/ |
| OPERATIONAL/ | 01-OPERATIONAL/ |
| QUEUE/ | 02-QUEUE/ |
| SOURCES/ | 03-SOURCES/ |
| ARCHIVE/ | 04-ARCHIVE/ |
| EXEMPLA/ | 05-EXEMPLA/ |

Orphan directories now glaringly obvious:
- Tech/ (no prefix - awaiting disposition)
- Transcendence/ (no prefix - awaiting disposition)
- Transcript/ (no prefix - awaiting disposition)

---

## PHASE 5: PARADIGM SOURCE INTEGRATION

**Status**: EXECUTED

Four sources integrated into CANON (documentation-to-execution remediation):

### 1. SOURCE-20250320-041: Benjamin Bratton
**Target**: [[CANON-00015-MACROSCOPIC_NARRATIVES-cosmos]], [[CANON-30400-AGENTIC_ARCHITECTURE-comet-INTELLIGENCE]]
**Integration**: Added "Pre-Paradigmatic Moment" and "Cosmopolitics" frameworks

### 2. SOURCE-20250528-043: Sara Imari Walker
**Target**: [[CANON-00015-MACROSCOPIC_NARRATIVES-cosmos]], [[CANON-30400-AGENTIC_ARCHITECTURE-comet-INTELLIGENCE]]
**Integration**: Added "Assembly Theory" and "AI as Life Extension" perspectives

### 3. SOURCE-20250403-051: Scott Alexander & Daniel Kokotajlo
**Target**: [[CANON-00015-MACROSCOPIC_NARRATIVES-cosmos]]
**Integration**: Added "R&D Progress Multiplier" and "Mid-2027 Branch Point" frameworks

### 4. SOURCE-20250522-053: Sholto Douglas & Trenton Bricken
**Target**: [[CANON-30400-AGENTIC_ARCHITECTURE-comet-INTELLIGENCE]]
**Integration**: Added "Two-Axes Framework", "Clean Reward Thesis", "Neuralese" concepts

### Files Modified:
- 00-CANON/CANON-00015-MACROSCOPIC_NARRATIVES-cosmos.md (added INTEGRATED SOURCES section)
- 00-CANON/CANON-30400-AGENTIC_ARCHITECTURE-comet-INTELLIGENCE.md (extended PRACTITIONER VALIDATIONS)

## HYGIENE CHECK

### Pre-Commit Verification
- [x] No orphan files at repository root
- [x] Numbered directories follow 00-05 prefix convention
- [x] Orphan directories (Tech, Transcendence, Transcript) clearly visible for Sovereign decision

### Fresh-Agent Test
- [x] CANON file: root → 00-CANON/ → file (2 decisions)
- [x] Source file: root → 03-SOURCES/ → processed/ → file (3 decisions)
- [x] Operational: root → 01-OPERATIONAL/ → domain/ → file (3 decisions)

### Deferred Items
| Item | Reason | Target |
|------|--------|--------|
| Tech/ (559 files) | Not in directive scope | Sovereign decision |
| Transcendence/ (45 files) | Not in directive scope | Sovereign decision |
| Transcript/ (316 files) | Not in directive scope | Sovereign decision |

---

## METRICS

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Additional files deleted | 10 (remnants/) |
| Files renamed/moved | 6 directories + 1 archive file |
| CANON files updated | 2 |
| Sources integrated | 4 |
