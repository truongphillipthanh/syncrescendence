## KEY FINDINGS

### Old Numbering System
- **Files affected**: 4
- **References found**: 100+
- **Status**: Ready for editing

| File | Old References |
|------|----------------|
| CANON-00000-SCHEMA-cosmos.md | ~50 |
| CANON-00007-ARTIFACT_PROTOCOL-cosmos.md | ~40 |
| CANON-21000-CHAIN_MATRIX-lattice.md | ~5 |
| CANON-99000-HISTORICAL-meta.md | ~10 |

### Chain Name Variance
- **Files affected**: 30+
- **References found**: 200+
- **Status**: Awaiting Oracle decision

| Old Name | New Name (per files) | Occurrences |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| Technology Chain | Intelligence Chain | ~100 |
| Sensing Chain | Information Chain | ~35 |
| Coherence Chain | Insight Chain | ~40 |
| Efficacy Chain | Expertise Chain | ~40 |
| Embodiment Chain | Knowledge Chain | ~30 |
| Transcendence Chain | Wisdom Chain | ~30 |

### Version Distribution
| Version | Files | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| 2.3.0 | 8 | cosmos tier |
| 2.2.0 | 5 | lattice + chains |
| 1.1.0 | 4 | mixed |
| 1.0.0 | 47 | majority |
| 1.2.0 | 1 | single file |

### Definition Sources (Clear)
| Concept | Authoritative Source |
|---------|---------------------|
| Syncrescendence | CANON-00001 |
| Six Chains | CANON-00000 |
| Seven Layers | CANON-20000 |
| Four Planetary Bodies | CANON-10000 |
| Modal Sequence | CANON-00008 |
| Field Node | CANON-35200 |
| IIC | CANON-31140 |

## FILES CREATED

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| orchestration/execution_logs/RECONNAISSANCE_REPORT.md | Comprehensive findings |
| orchestration/execution_logs/EXECUTION_LOG-2025-12-30-021.md | This file |
| orchestration/directives/DIRECTIVE-021_PHASE3_RECONNAISSANCE.md | Archived directive |

---

## FILES UPDATED

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| orchestration/state/CURRENT_STATE.md | Added reconnaissance findings, decision required |
| orchestration/state/BACKLOG.md | Added Phase 3 task breakdown, streams A-D defined |

---

## PARALLELIZATION STRATEGY

| Stream | Files | Status | Dependencies |
|--------|-------|--------|--------------|
| A | 4 | READY | None |
| B | 30+ | BLOCKED | Oracle decision on chain names |
| C | 65 | PENDING | After A+B |
| D | ~5 | LOW | After C |

---

## BLOCKER

**Chain Naming Decision**: Oracle6 must decide convention before Stream B:
- Option A: Update prose to new names (Intelligence, Information, Insight, Expertise, Knowledge, Wisdom)
- Option B: Keep old names (Technology, Sensing, Coherence, Efficacy, Embodiment, Transcendence)
- Option C: Use both with pattern
