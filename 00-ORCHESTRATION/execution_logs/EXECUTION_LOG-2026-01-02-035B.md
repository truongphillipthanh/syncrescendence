# EXECUTION LOG: DIRECTIVE-035B
## Tech Lunar Triage + Source Processing + Oracle9 Burndown

**Executed**: 2026-01-02
**Agent**: Claude Code (Opus 4.5)
**Status**: **COMPLETE**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This directive advanced Oracle9 toward completion by:
1. Completing Tech Lunar triage decisions
2. Documenting paradigm source batch priorities
3. Updating project management with Oracle9 burndown visibility
4. Clarifying Oracle10 blockers

---

## PHASE 1: TECH LUNAR TRIAGE

### Decisions Made

| Content | Size | Decision | Rationale |
|---------|------|----------|-----------|
| Technology Lunar - Unified.md | 65K | ARCHIVE (reference) | External business methodology synthesis, not core CANON |
| Prompt Engineering Manuals (Claude/GPT/Gemini) | 180K | RELEASE | Vendor documentation synthesis, rapidly obsoleting |
| Platform System Prompts (raw exports) | ~30K | RELEASE | Redundant with OPERATIONAL/prompts/unified/ |
| Screenplay Formatting | varies | ALREADY DEFERRED | In QUEUE/modal2/ (Modal 2 content) |
| Tool Landscape (ai_tools_cartography_2025) | 92K | RELEASE | Time-sensitive 2025 survey, will rapidly obsolete |

### 18-Lens Analysis

**Why RELEASE for vendor documentation:**
- Bitter Lesson: Platform-specific guidance obsoletes quickly
- Antifragile: Manual updates break antifragility
- First Principles: Labs provide official docs; our value-add is integration

**Why ARCHIVE for Unified.md:**
- Contains three distinct business systemization frameworks
- External methodology synthesis (not original Syncrescendence content)
- Potentially useful as reference but not core CANON

## PHASE 2: PARADIGM SOURCE BATCH PRIORITIES

### Current Status
- **Total paradigm sources**: 47
- **Already processed**: 4 (Sutton, Hassabis, Karpathy x2)
- **Remaining**: 43
- **Target for Oracle9**: 20+ processed

### Priority Batch 1 Selection (5 sources)

| Priority | Source | Guest | Why Priority |
|----------|--------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | longnow-benjamin_bratton | Benjamin Bratton | Planetary computation, cosmopolitics |
| 2 | longnow-sara_imari_walker | Sara Imari Walker | Complexity/life science, assembly theory |
| 3 | dwarkesh-scott_alexander_daniel_kokotajlo | Scott Alexander, Daniel Kokotajlo | AGI forecasting, rationalist perspective |
| 4 | dwarkesh-sholto_douglas_trenton_bricken | Sholto Douglas, Trenton Bricken | Anthropic researchers, interpretability |
| 5 | mlst-blaise_aguera_y_arcas | Blaise Aguera y Arcas | Google, embodied AI |

### Batch Structure (Full Processing Plan)

| Batch | Sources | Content Focus |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | 5 | Philosophy + complexity + AGI forecasting |
| 2 | 10 | AI labs + scaling perspectives |
| 3 | 10 | Biology + evolution + longevity |
| 4 | 10 | Economics + governance + systems |
| 5 | 8 | Remaining paradigm sources |

---

## PHASE 3: PROJECT MANAGEMENT UPDATE

### DASHBOARD.md Updates
- Oracle9 progress: 20% → 70%
- Added Oracle9 completion status section
- Added completed tasks list (9 tasks)
- Updated burndown with source processing visibility
- Documented Oracle10 blockers

### Task Status Summary

| Status | Count | Change |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Done | 9 | +4 |
| In Progress | 2 | +2 |
| Not Started | 2 | -2 |
| Blocked | 0 | 0 |

---

## PHASE 4: ORACLE9 COMPLETION STATUS

### Completed Criteria
- [x] SOURCES infrastructure operational
- [x] sources.csv with 8-dimensional schema
- [x] Processing pattern established (PROCESSING_PATTERN.md)
- [x] Project management system operational
- [x] QUEUE at inbox zero (pending/ empty)
- [x] Tech Lunar triaged

### Remaining Criteria
- [ ] 20+ paradigm sources processed (currently 4/47)
- [ ] Coherence content properly absorbed (recovered, awaiting distillation)

### Oracle10 Blockers (Documented)
1. **Paradigm source processing**: Need 20+ of 47 processed
2. **Coherence distillation**: DIRECTIVE-035A in progress
3. **Enriched CANON**: Required for IIC configuration

## DELIVERABLES

### Files Modified
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| orchestration/state/DASHBOARD.md | Updated with Oracle9 burndown and completion status |

### Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| orchestration/execution_logs/EXECUTION_LOG-2026-01-02-035B.md | This document |

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Execute DIRECTIVE-035A (Coherence distillation)
2. Process paradigm batch 1 (5 sources)
3. Continue toward 20+ paradigm sources

### For Oracle9 Completion
- Focus on paradigm source batch processing
- Complete Coherence distillation
- Validate processing pattern works at scale

### For Oracle10 Preparation
- Enriched CANON will enable IIC configuration
- Platform-specific prompt configurations depend on CANON content
- Account architecture documentation ready ([[CANON-31140-IIC-lunar-ACUMEN-planetary-INFORMATION]], 31141)
