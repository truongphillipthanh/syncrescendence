# EXECUTION LOG: DIRECTIVE-043B
**Date**: 2026-01-11
**Stream**: B (Claude 3 - Opus 4.5)
**Directive**: 043B - Operational Hygiene & Research Integration
**Status**: COMPLETE

## Phase 1: Research Canonization

| Document | Lines | Disposition | Integrated Into |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| cognitive_profile.md | 84 | ARCHIVED | ARCH-COGNITIVE_PROFILE_2026-01.md |
| frontier_models.md | 1,459 | ARCHIVED | ARCH-FRONTIER_MODELS_2026-01.md |
| platform_features.md | 1,948 | ARCHIVED | ARCH-PLATFORM_FEATURES_2026-01.md |
| STRATEGIC_RECONNAISSANCE_REPORT_ENHANCED.md | 597 | ARCHIVED | ARCH-RECONNAISSANCE_2026-01.md |

**Total**: 4,088 lines of research archived with proper frontmatter

**Assessment Notes**:
- cognitive_profile.md contains Principal-specific cognitive architecture; cross-referenced to CANON-35120
- frontier_models.md is temporal (Q1 2026); archived with warning about expiration
- platform_features.md is temporal; archived with warning
- STRATEGIC_RECONNAISSANCE_REPORT.md synthesizes all three; archived as comprehensive reference

**Decision**: These documents are archived rather than canonized because:
1. They represent temporal intelligence (model capabilities, platform features) that will become outdated
2. CANON documents should contain evergreen wisdom, not snapshot-in-time data
3. The actionable insights (multi-model orchestration, constellation architecture) have been integrated into operational CANON documents by DIRECTIVE-043A

## Phase 2: Repository Hygiene

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Root-level .md files | 24 | 9 |
| Orphan files at root | 15 | 0 |
| 05-MEMORY .md files | 34 | 46 |

**Files Relocated**:
| File | From | To | Reason |
|------|------|-----|--------|
| cognitive_profile.md | root | 05-MEMORY/ARCH-COGNITIVE_PROFILE_2026-01.md | Research artifact |
| frontier_models.md | root | 05-MEMORY/ARCH-FRONTIER_MODELS_2026-01.md | Research artifact |
| platform_features.md | root | 05-MEMORY/ARCH-PLATFORM_FEATURES_2026-01.md | Research artifact |
| STRATEGIC_RECONNAISSANCE_REPORT_ENHANCED.md | root | 05-MEMORY/ARCH-RECONNAISSANCE_2026-01.md | Synthesis artifact |
| GEMINI.md | root | 02-ENGINE/GEMINI.md | Active configuration |
| GEMINI_VALIDATION_REPORT.md | root | 05-MEMORY/ | Historical validation |
| ORACLE10_CULMINATION.md | root | 00-ORCHESTRATION/logs/ | Oracle session doc |
| ORACLE11_*.md (4 files) | root | 05-MEMORY/ | Superseded by Oracle 12 |
| BLITZKRIEG_*_GUIDE.md (2 files) | root | 05-MEMORY/ARCH-BLITZKRIEG_*.md | Deployment archives |
| addtions.md | root | 05-MEMORY/ARCH-REVIEW_VS_RETROSPECTIVE.md | Research note |
| ORACLE12_CONTEXT.md | root | 00-ORCHESTRATION/ | Active context |

## Phase 3: SCAFF Metabolism

| File | Disposition | Reason |
|------|-------------|--------|
| SCAFF-ALPHA_*.md (5 files) | RETAIN | Oracle 5 audit trail |
| SCAFF-BETA_*.md (3 files) | RETAIN | Oracle 5 audit trail |
| SCAFF-ORACLE*.md (3 files) | RETAIN | Oracle culmination records |
| SCAFF-*_REPORT.md (4 files) | RETAIN | Historical audits |
| SCAFF-CURRENT_STATE.md | RETAIN | Historical snapshot |
| SCAFF-THREAD_TRAJECTORY.md | RETAIN | Historical planning |
| SCAFF-DEFRAG_EXECUTION_LOG.md | RETAIN | Historical execution |

**Total SCAFF files**: 18
**Assessment**: All SCAFF files serve as historical audit trail. Unique value has already been extracted into CANON/operational documents during Oracles 5-10. No metabolism (deletion) required.

---

## Phase 4: Execution Log Archaeology

**Execution logs surveyed**: 6 in 00-ORCHESTRATION/logs/
**Recommendation**: Current count is manageable. Monthly consolidation only needed when count exceeds 30.

## Verification

### Repository Structure (Flat Principle)
```
./00-ORCHESTRATION/ - 29 .md files (state/, logs/, oracle_contexts/)
./01-CANON/ - 78 CANON documents
./02-ENGINE/ - 6 .md files + subdirs (memory/, models/, prompts/, etc.)
./05-MEMORY/ - 46 archived documents
./Root - 9 .md files (CLAUDE.md + 8 DIRECTIVE-043*.md)
```

### Ledger Status
- tasks.csv: Updated with TASK-084 through TASK-087
- projects.csv: No changes required

---

## Duration
- Start: 2026-01-11
- End: 2026-01-11
- Total: ~45 minutes
