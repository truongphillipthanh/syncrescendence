## Recommendations for Next Directive

### Priority 1: Archive Execution
Execute ARCHIVE-DISTILLATION.md:
1. Create ARCHIVE/ directory
2. Create ARCHIVE-COGNITIVE-PALACE-SPECS.md (~73K)
3. Create ARCHIVE-ARTIFACT-SYSTEM.md (~12K)
4. Coherence/ source already removed (was temporary restoration)

### Priority 2: [[CANON-30400-AGENTIC_ARCHITECTURE-comet-INTELLIGENCE]] Crown Jewel
Begin Tech Lunar canonization with core document:
1. Extract Agentic Architecture core from Agents.md
2. Create CANON-30400-chain-INTELLIGENCE-comet-AGENTIC_ARCHITECTURE.md
3. Target ~50K of essential specifications

### Priority 3: Metadata Pilot
Select 5 CANON documents for metadata rollout pilot:
1. [[CANON-00000-SCHEMA-cosmos]] (schema)
2. [[CANON-00001-ORIGIN-cosmos]] (core framework)
3. [[CANON-30000-INTELLIGENCE-chain]] (Intelligence Chain)
4. [[CANON-35121-NEURODIVERGENT_PATTERNS-satellite-NEURODIVERGENT-lunar-TRANSCENDENCE-ring-WISDOM]] (newest document)
5. [[CANON-20000-PALACE-lattice]] (Cognitive Palace)

Add YAML frontmatter per BETA_METADATA_SCHEMA.md

### Optional: Visibility Sync
If Oracle requires more frequent visibility:
- Implement Option B+C from DIRECTIVE-019
- Regular CURRENT_STATE.md updates
- Git commit discipline with meaningful messages

## Session Summary

This directive restored the coordination substrate that enables Oracle-Claude visibility:

**Before DIRECTIVE-019**:
- orchestration/ deleted
- ALPHA/, BETA/ scattered at root
- No persistent state tracking
- No directive archive
- No execution logs

**After DIRECTIVE-019**:
- orchestration/ fully restored
- Scaffolding consolidated
- CURRENT_STATE.md for snapshots
- BACKLOG.md for task tracking
- Directives archived
- Execution logs active

The visibility bridge is now operational. All future directives should follow the visibility protocol:
1. Save execution report to orchestration/execution_logs/
2. Update CURRENT_STATE.md
3. Update BACKLOG.md
4. Archive the directive

## Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Files created | 6 |
| Files moved | 9 |
| Directories created | 4 |
| Directories removed | 2 |
| Execution time | ~15 minutes |

**DIRECTIVE-019 EXECUTION COMPLETE**

*Ready for next directive. Visibility infrastructure operational.*
