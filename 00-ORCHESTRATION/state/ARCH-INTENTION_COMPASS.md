# INTENTION ARCHAEOLOGY COMPASS
## Oracle Pedigree Extraction Instrument
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-09
**Oracle Lineage**: 0 → 15+
**Status**: Rolling snapshot
**Authority**: Oracle 13+ / Commander

---

## PURPOSE

The Intention Archaeology Compass is a unified instrument that extracts, categorizes, and tracks Sovereign intentions across Oracle sessions. It serves as both:
- **Cache**: Quick reference for active intentions
- **Rolling Snapshot**: Historical record of intention evolution

From Oracle 12 (Sovereign's words):
> "The intention archaeology compass should be unified. All intentions are compounding vectors that are interdependent... In essence, it's a cache, but it's also a rolling snapshot."

---

## SCHEMA

Each intention entry contains:

```yaml
- id: INT-XXXX
  oracle: [origin Oracle number]
  timestamp: [ISO datetime or Oracle reference]
  category: [urgent|sprint|backlog|pattern|capture]
  priority: [P0|P1|P2|P3]
  status: [active|resolved|superseded|deferred]
  text: "[Sovereign's actual words]"
  interpretation: "[Oracle's understanding]"
  blocked_by: [null|dependency]
  integrated_into: [null|CANON/task/decision]
  notes: "[additional context]"
```

### Category Definitions

| Category | Description | Action Horizon |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **urgent** | Address NOW | Same session |
| **sprint** | Integrate at checkpoint | Current Oracle |
| **backlog** | Future work | Future Oracles |
| **pattern** | Meta-observations | Ongoing |
| **capture** | Undifferentiated inbox | Pending triage |

### PATTERNS (Meta-Observations)

| ID | Oracle | Pattern | Status | Notes |
|----|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| INT-P001 | 3 | "Orchestration is OPERATIONAL, not CANON" | resolved | Constitutional rule |
| INT-P002 | 4 | "Metabolism applies to CONTENT, not infrastructure" | resolved | Constitutional rule |
| INT-P003 | 6 | "Verify before declare" | resolved | Constitutional rule |
| INT-P004 | 7 | "Globe before trees" | active | Holistic framing first |
| INT-P005 | 10 | "automation infrastructure must precede content work" | resolved | PROJ-011 complete |
| INT-P006 | 12 | "Multi-agent 90.2% outperforms single-agent" | active | Constellation justification |
| INT-P007 | 12 | "Pedigree supersedes handoff for repository-centric work" | active | New paradigm |
| INT-P008 | 12 | "Temporal vs evergreen distinction" | resolved | Archive temporal intelligence with expiration warning; CANON = evergreen only |
| INT-P014 | 16 | "Tokens are the new minerals and vespene gas" | active | Token economics as strategic resource management. StarCraft resource model applied to API credits, context windows, compute. |
| INT-P015 | 16 | "Mac mini = stable dashboard (macro), MBA = kinetic cockpit (micro)" | active | Dual-machine interaction paradigm. Mac mini: always-on, terminal-based, less frequent interaction, StarCraft macro. MBA: synaptic, kinetic, consistent but audible-ready. |
| INT-P016 | 16 | "Web app system prompts general, leverage platform strengths — confirmed superior" | active | Thesis validated: general prompts + platform-native strengths beats over-specialization. Memory architecture needs audit post-pivot. |
| INT-P017 | 17 | "File-First, Always — plain markdown outperforms specialized memory infrastructure" | active | ClawVault benchmark: markdown+grep 74.0% vs specialized tools 68.5%. LLMs trained on text files. Own data as files. |
| INT-P018 | 17 | "Supersede, Never Delete — all state changes preserve history via supersession chains" | active | Temporal record of knowledge evolution more valuable than current state alone. |
| INT-P019 | 17 | "Security as Binding Constraint — limiting factor is safety, not capability" | active | 200+ exposed instances, supply chain attacks, prompt injection. Defense-in-depth is not optional. |
| INT-P020 | 17 | "The Verbatim Trap Test — every synthesis must produce what the source didn't contain" | active | Connections, tensions, implications, questions. If not, reject and redo. Anti-pattern for all Constellation work. |
| INT-P021 | 17 | "Knowledge-Code Isomorphism — knowledge bases and codebases share identical structure" | active | Same tools (git, grep, hooks, CI/CD) manage both. Vault index = skill discovery. Notes = skills. |
| INT-P022 | 17 | "The Constellation pattern is emergent consensus — independent practitioners converged on our architecture" | active | Differentiation from quality of personality files, memory curation, coordination patterns, security hardening. |

## INTEGRATION PROTOCOL

### 1. Extraction (During Oracle Session)

When Sovereign speaks:
1. Capture exact words in quotes
2. Assign temporary INT-XXXX ID
3. Note Oracle number
4. Add to CAPTURE category if unclear

### 2. Categorization (Session Checkpoint)

Move from CAPTURE to appropriate category:
- **urgent**: Requires immediate action
- **sprint**: Part of current cycle
- **backlog**: Future work
- **pattern**: Meta-observation

### 3. Resolution Tracking

When intention is addressed:
1. Update status to `resolved`
2. Add `integrated_into` reference
3. Document outcome

### 4. Supersession

When intention is replaced:
1. Update status to `superseded`
2. Reference replacing intention
3. Document rationale

## PATTERN ANALYSIS

### Recurring Themes

1. **Velocity**: "capitalize", "heavy machinery", "accelerating pace", "begin all automations"
2. **Architecture**: "constellation", "5-platform", "specialization", "JIT-software"
3. **Sustainability**: "self-sustaining", "month end"
4. **Holism**: "unified", "integrated", "globe before trees", "LifeOS convergence"
5. **Trade-off Pragmatism**: "everything is trade-offs", "don't disqualify for spottiness"
6. **Compression**: "algebraize", "symbolize", "reduce tokens maximize semantics", "Rails conventions"
7. **Automation**: "Hazel", "macros", "bridge web and CLI", "sensing", "begin ALL automations"
8. **Resource Economics**: "tokens are the new minerals and vespene gas", API credits as strategic resource
9. **Dual-Machine Paradigm**: Mac mini = stable dashboard (macro), MBA = kinetic cockpit (micro)
10. **Information Stream Extraction**: Apple Notes, YouTube, X favorites — ingest/digest/excrete cycle
11. **Narrative Depth**: Marvel, Star Wars, Star Trek, Accelerando join StarCraft/Dune/Halo/anime/gaming

### Anti-Patterns Identified

1. **Oracle 4 Category Error**: Applied metabolism to infrastructure
2. **Oracle 6 Verification Failure**: Evaluated reports, not reality
3. **Fragmented Intention Tracking**: Pre-compass scattered approach

### Success Patterns

1. **Oracle 3 Model**: Orchestration infrastructure pattern
2. **Oracle 10-11 Blitzkrieg**: Parallel stream execution
3. **Oracle 12 Constellation**: Purpose-specialized platforms
