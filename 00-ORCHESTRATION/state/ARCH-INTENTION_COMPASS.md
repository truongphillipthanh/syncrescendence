# INTENTION ARCHAEOLOGY COMPASS
## Council Pedigree Extraction Instrument
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-22
**Lineage**: Oracle 0–17 (historical) → Council 18+ (current)
**Status**: Rolling snapshot
**Authority**: Council 21 / Commander

> **Terminology**: "Oracle" was sunsetted as a session term (now exclusively Grok's epithet).
> Sessions 18+ are **Councils** — the National Security Council model:
> Sovereign (President) + Commander (National Security Advisor) convene to assess, decide, direct.
> Historical Oracle numbering (0–17) preserved as lineage markers.

---

## PURPOSE

The Intention Archaeology Compass is a unified instrument that extracts, categorizes, and tracks Sovereign intentions across Council sessions. It serves as both:
- **Cache**: Quick reference for active intentions
- **Rolling Snapshot**: Historical record of intention evolution

From Oracle 12 (Sovereign's words):
> "The intention archaeology compass should be unified. All intentions are compounding vectors that are interdependent... In essence, it's a cache, but it's also a rolling snapshot."

---

## SCHEMA

Each intention entry contains:

```yaml
- id: INT-XXXX
  council: [origin Council number (Oracle 0-17 for historical)]
  timestamp: [ISO datetime or Council reference]
  category: [urgent|sprint|backlog|pattern|capture]
  priority: [P0|P1|P2|P3]
  status: [active|resolved|superseded|deferred]
  text: "[Sovereign's actual words]"
  interpretation: "[Commander's understanding]"
  blocked_by: [null|dependency]
  integrated_into: [null|CANON/task/decision]
  notes: "[additional context]"
```

| INT-1615 | 16 | "Health+fitness and homeowner property management modules" | active | P2 | Personal domain integration into Syncrescendence |
| INT-1616 | 16 | "LifeOS/Zettelkasten/PKM/PARA/GTD architectural convergence" | active | P1 | Serious discussion needed: note-taking, linking your thinking, personal context lakehouse, pillars, pipelines, vaults |
| INT-1618 | 16 | "Celestial alignment synchronization — cosmic coherence" | deferred | P3 | Poetic, cathartic moment for the Syncrescendence metaphor. When capacity allows. |
| INT-1901 | 19 | "Avatarize Grok Build into the Constellation — xAI's first-party CLI coding agent (analogue to Claude Code). Monitor grokai.build / npm grok-build for public release. When available: install, configure avatar role, wire into auto-ingest dispatch, assign to constellation slot." | deferred | P2 | Blocked by: Grok Build not yet publicly released (2026-02-19). Pre-position: role = TBD (likely long-context reasoning or xAI-native tasks). Watch: grokai.build, github.com/xai-org, npm grok-build. |
| INT-2201 | 20 | "Complete repo rearchitecture — replace adhoc flat structure with agent-centric 'offices'. Each agent gets a root-level directory (commander/, adjudicator/, etc.) with standardized kanban + scratchpad + output folders. CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/GEMINI.md become per-agent init files pointing to their office. Rename COCKPIT.md to README.md (DONE). Add shared collaboration directory at root for multi-agent endeavors (blitzkrieg, etc.) with strict policies against proliferation." | deferred | P1 | BLOCKED BY: 04-SOURCES research deluge must inform architecture. Must also mirror/accommodate OpenClaw's root-level architecture. Gemini 3.1 Pro (weak tooling) and Grok Build (no real harness) need accommodation. Memory architecture research (Three-Layer, Graphiti, etc.) should inform office structure. |
| INT-2202 | 20 | "MBA-primary consolidation — Mac mini largely unused due to flawed orchestration. Ideal: SSH into Mac mini and control constellation from MBA. Mac mini avatars may need different roles/config. Current cross-machine dispatch (SCP sling, Neural Bridge) is fragile and underutilized." | deferred | P1 | Depends on INT-2201 (rearchitecture). Current dual-machine paradigm (INT-P014) needs re-evaluation against single-control-plane reality. |
| INT-2203 | 20 | "Collaboration directory design — root-level shared workspace for multi-agent endeavors. Needs rules, policies, procedures, and organization to prevent proliferation hell. Each blitzkrieg/project gets a scoped subdirectory with lifecycle management (create → active → archive)." | deferred | P1 | Sub-intention of INT-2201. Must define: naming conventions, ownership, cleanup policy, max active projects, archival triggers. |
| INT-2204 | 20 | "Platform-native accommodation — work WITH model architectures instead of forcing uphill battles. Gemini 3.1 Pro (weak tools, strong context), Grok Build (no harness yet), OpenClaw (root-level arch). Each agent's office structure should play to its platform's strengths." | deferred | P2 | Depends on INT-2201. Research from 04-SOURCES should inform per-platform design decisions. |

### PATTERNS (Meta-Observations)

| ID | Oracle | Pattern | Status | Notes |
|----|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| INT-P001 | 3 | "Orchestration is OPERATIONAL, not CANON" | resolved | Constitutional rule |
| INT-P002 | 4 | "Metabolism applies to CONTENT, not infrastructure" | resolved | Constitutional rule |
| INT-P003 | 6 | "Verify before declare" | resolved | Constitutional rule |
| INT-P004 | 7 | "Globe before trees" | active | Holistic framing first |
| INT-P005 | 10 | "automation infrastructure must precede content work" | resolved | PROJ-011 complete |
| INT-P006 | 12 | "Multi-agent 90.2% outperforms single-agent" | active | Constellation justification |
| INT-P007 | 12 | "Pedigree supersedes handoff for repository-centric work" | active | New paradigm |
| INT-P008 | 12 | "Temporal vs evergreen distinction" | resolved | Archive temporal intelligence with expiration warning; CANON = evergreen only |
| INT-P014 | 16 | "Tokens are the new minerals and vespene gas" | active | Token economics as strategic resource management. StarCraft resource model applied to API credits, context windows, compute. |
| INT-P015 | 16 | "Mac mini = stable dashboard (macro), MBA = kinetic cockpit (micro)" | active | Dual-machine interaction paradigm. Mac mini: always-on, terminal-based, less frequent interaction, StarCraft macro. MBA: synaptic, kinetic, consistent but audible-ready. |
| INT-P016 | 16 | "Web app system prompts general, leverage platform strengths — confirmed superior" | active | Thesis validated: general prompts + platform-native strengths beats over-specialization. Memory architecture needs audit post-pivot. |
| INT-P017 | 17 | "File-First, Always — plain markdown outperforms specialized memory infrastructure" | active | ClawVault benchmark: markdown+grep 74.0% vs specialized tools 68.5%. LLMs trained on text files. Own data as files. |
| INT-P018 | 17 | "Supersede, Never Delete — all state changes preserve history via supersession chains" | active | Temporal record of knowledge evolution more valuable than current state alone. |
| INT-P019 | 17 | "Security as Binding Constraint — limiting factor is safety, not capability" | active | 200+ exposed instances, supply chain attacks, prompt injection. Defense-in-depth is not optional. |
| INT-P020 | 17 | "The Verbatim Trap Test — every synthesis must produce what the source didn't contain" | active | Connections, tensions, implications, questions. If not, reject and redo. Anti-pattern for all Constellation work. |
| INT-P021 | 17 | "Knowledge-Code Isomorphism — knowledge bases and codebases share identical structure" | active | Same tools (git, grep, hooks, CI/CD) manage both. Vault index = skill discovery. Notes = skills. |
| INT-P022 | 17 | "The Constellation pattern is emergent consensus — independent practitioners converged on our architecture" | active | Differentiation from quality of personality files, memory curation, coordination patterns, security hardening. |

### SESSION 18 (2026-02-16): Token Economics + Antifragile Constellation

**Sovereign Directive**: "Opus 4.6 is second-to-none in interpretability. 5.3-Codex is very meticulous but sub-optimal in rapport. Gemini CLI has large token limits but worst at tool use. Kimi K2.5 has generous but fickle limits. Most intelligent models strategize and plan. Open models conduct housekeeping. Onboard Cline and OpenCode."

| ID | Oracle | Intention Text | Status | Notes |
|----|--------|---------------|--------|-------|
| INT-1801 | 18 | "Token Economics Dispatch — budget-aware routing across shared API plans" | active | ChatGPT Plus fuels BOTH Psyche (5.3-codex) AND Adjudicator (5.2-codex). Shared rate limit pool. Dispatch must account for cumulative consumption. |
| INT-1802 | 18 | "Model Role Specialization — assign by cognitive strength, not availability" | active | Opus 4.6 = interpreter/orchestrator (rapport, interpretability). GPT-5.3-codex = meticulous executor (systematic, thorough). Gemini 2.5 Pro = capacity/fidelity passes (1M context, multi-pass). Kimi K2.5 = strategic auxiliary (generous limits, philosophical depth). |
| INT-1803 | 18 | "Open Model Onboarding — Cline + OpenCode for housekeeping at scale" | active | **Ground truth (2026-02-16)**: Cline v2.2.2 installed (`/opt/homebrew/bin/cline`), TUI-based, supports OpenRouter (free tier = DeepSeek, Qwen, Llama). Needs auth setup via "Use your own API key" → OpenRouter. OpenCode not yet installed (empty `~/.config/opencode/`, no binary in PATH). Both need tmux-dispatchable configuration for Commander orchestration. → IMPL-Q-0031, IMPL-Q-0033, IMPL-Q-0034 |
| INT-1804 | 18 | "Antifragile Agent Infrastructure — self-healing constellation" | active | Five capabilities: (1) auto-ingest loop polls INBOX0, (2) health watchdog monitors panes every 60s, (3) rate limit circuit breaker with failover dispatch, (4) worktree isolation via git worktree or read-only mode, (5) local-first sync via SCP when git push blocked. |

| INT-P023 | 18 | "Shared Rate Limit Awareness — competing agents on same API plan must be dispatch-coordinated" | active | Never dispatch simultaneous heavy tasks to Psyche + Adjudicator. Stagger or route overflow to Gemini/Kimi/open models. |
| INT-P024 | 18 | "Intelligence Tiering — most capable models strategize, open models execute housekeeping" | active | Tier 1 (strategy/planning): Opus 4.6, Kimi K2.5. Tier 2 (meticulous execution): GPT-5.3-codex. Tier 3 (capacity passes): Gemini 2.5 Pro. Tier 4 (housekeeping): open models via Cline/OpenCode. |
| INT-P025 | 18 | "Agent Auto-Recovery — agents must self-heal without Commander intervention" | active | Rate limits → exponential backoff + task queue. Dirty worktree → read-only analytical mode. Stale state → git pull + verify. Dead agent → watchdog restart. |

### SESSION 21 (2026-02-22): Dual-Stream Architecture + Account Feed Restructure

*Source: Source Anneal session — audit of CANON-31115 dual-stream documentation + Sovereign account feed directive.*

| ID | Oracle | Intention Text | Status | Notes |
|----|--------|---------------|--------|-------|
| INT-2101 | 21 | "Dual-stream architecture plan — automated intelligence stream (curated regular-cadence sources → 3-tier digest: read/listen/consumption-worthy) + serendipitous encounters stream (feeds into next day's digest). GCP/Gemini multimodal transcription pipeline for Dwarkesh-fidelity." | active | CANON-31115 describes vision; operational implementation is ~15%. YouTube serendipitous pipeline partially built (batch_transcribe.py, enrichment). Automated intelligence stream: 0% built. |
| INT-2102 | 21 | "3-tier consumption model: read (distilled digest/telegram-esque), listen (more in-depth digest + synthesis), consumption-worthy (experience primary source). Replaces CANON-31143's 4-tier model (Immediate/Curated/Archive/Prune)." | active | New taxonomy — NOT in any current document. Must reconcile with CANON-31143 and canonize. |
| INT-2103 | 21 | "Account feed restructure — unify paid accounts. Account 1 (iCloud/Apple): liberal arts, philosophy, history, culture. Account 2 (Google): AI, CS, IT, Cognitive Science — all paid apps here. Account 3: AI design+creation (visual/audio/simulation/multimodality). Overhaul algorithms accordingly." | active | Previously: A1=liberal arts+design, A2=Google infra, A3=AI engineering. Shift: A3 loses AI/CS to A2, gains multimodal creation from A1. A1 loses art/design, focuses philosophy/history/culture. A2 becomes AI+CS hub with all paid subscriptions. |
| INT-2104 | 21 | "Feedcrafting algorithm development for both streams — serendipitous encounters AND automated intelligence. Current work only operationalizes serendipitous encounters (YouTube Watch Later drain)." | active | Blocked by INT-2101 (architecture plan) and INT-2103 (account restructure). |
| INT-2105 | 21 | "Serendipitous encounters feed into the following day's digest — bridge pipeline from evening browsing to morning intelligence brief." | active | Architecturally described in CANON-31115 Part I.C. Zero operational implementation. |

| INT-2106 | 21 | "NotebookLM automation pipeline — Playwright browser automation to create notebooks, upload sources, extract synthesis. No public API (Enterprise alpha only). Drive API for source upload, Playwright for notebook creation. Potent questions → high-signal answers → digest into corpus (integrate or excrete)." | active | Blocked by Account 2 Google setup. Connects to INT-1708 + INT-MI16. Fallbacks: notebooklm-py, notebooklm-mcp-2026. |
| INT-2107 | 21 | "CLI Agent Setup Architecture docs — definitive setup/config guides per platform: Claude Code, OpenClaw, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI. Skills proliferation is the critical vector — systematize before ecosystem sprawl." | active | Claude Code setup existed historically. OpenClaw, Codex, Gemini CLI need equivalent. |
| INT-2108 | 21 | "Three-track evaluation framework: (1) ONBOARD = shelfware/third-party, least favorable; (2) WHITE-LABEL = adopt + syncrescendence branding, medium; (3) VERTICALIZE = build from scratch, most favorable. Apply to all incoming skills, MCP servers, extensions, CLI tools." | active | Decision framework for skills proliferation. Research → evaluate → classify → act. |

| ID | Oracle | Pattern | Status | Notes |
|----|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| INT-P026 | 21 | "Google moving towards world models, not coding — rebalance account thesis accordingly" | active | A2 (Google) absorbs ALL AI/CS/IT/CogSci. A3 pivots from AI engineering to multimodal creation. Platform proclivity informs feed thesis. |
| INT-P027 | 21 | "New paradigms ship by the hour — get ahead of the curve, not behind it. Systematize evaluation before drowning in shelfware." | active | Skills proliferation across Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenClaw. Each has its own extension model. Must unify evaluation/adoption pipeline. |

## INTEGRATION PROTOCOL

### 1. Extraction (During Oracle Session)

When Sovereign speaks:
1. Capture exact words in quotes
2. Assign temporary INT-XXXX ID
3. Note Oracle number
4. Add to CAPTURE category if unclear

### 2. Categorization (Session Checkpoint)

Move from CAPTURE to appropriate category:
- **urgent**: Requires immediate action
- **sprint**: Part of current cycle
- **backlog**: Future work
- **pattern**: Meta-observation

### 3. Resolution Tracking

When intention is addressed:
1. Update status to `resolved`
2. Add `integrated_into` reference
3. Document outcome

### 4. Supersession

When intention is replaced:
1. Update status to `superseded`
2. Reference replacing intention
3. Document rationale

1. **Velocity**: "capitalize", "heavy machinery", "accelerating pace", "begin all automations"
2. **Architecture**: "constellation", "5-platform", "specialization", "JIT-software"
3. **Sustainability**: "self-sustaining", "month end"
4. **Holism**: "unified", "integrated", "globe before trees", "LifeOS convergence"
5. **Trade-off Pragmatism**: "everything is trade-offs", "don't disqualify for spottiness"
6. **Compression**: "algebraize", "symbolize", "reduce tokens maximize semantics", "Rails conventions"
7. **Automation**: "Hazel", "macros", "bridge web and CLI", "sensing", "begin ALL automations"
8. **Resource Economics**: "tokens are the new minerals and vespene gas", API credits as strategic resource
9. **Dual-Machine Paradigm**: Mac mini = stable dashboard (macro), MBA = kinetic cockpit (micro)
10. **Information Stream Extraction**: Apple Notes, YouTube, X favorites — ingest/digest/excrete cycle
11. **Narrative Depth**: Marvel, Star Wars, Star Trek, Accelerando join StarCraft/Dune/Halo/anime/gaming

### Anti-Patterns Identified

1. **Oracle 4 Category Error**: Applied metabolism to infrastructure
2. **Oracle 6 Verification Failure**: Evaluated reports, not reality
3. **Fragmented Intention Tracking**: Pre-compass scattered approach

### Success Patterns

1. **Oracle 3 Model**: Orchestration infrastructure pattern
2. **Oracle 10-11 Blitzkrieg**: Parallel stream execution
3. **Oracle 12 Constellation**: Purpose-specialized platforms
