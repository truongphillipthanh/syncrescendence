### CLARESCE3-RECURSIVE | 2026-02-10 06:00–07:15

- **Branch**: main
- **Fingerprint**: e5ebd24 → b715399
- **Outcome**: SUCCESS
- **Commits**: 3 (pass1: a4d8d8c, pass2: 015b50c, final: b715399)
- **Agent**: Commander (absorbed Cartographer + Adjudicator + Psyche workloads)
- **Session Span**: ~75 minutes

**Directives Executed**:
1. CLARESCE^3 Pass 1 — Atomization: Full system census (493 files, 186K lines, 100+ T0 intentions, 50 Linear, 26 ClickUp, 136 IMPL items). Agent dispatches fired but all 3 external agents failed. Commander absorbed all work. IntentionLink: INT-1202, INT-P004.
2. CLARESCE^3 Pass 2 — Alignment: Cross-referential analysis with charitable interpretation of 6 stalled vectors. 5 Invariants audited (2 PARTIAL). 5 anti-patterns identified. Dependency bottleneck: SOVEREIGN-009. IntentionLink: INT-1202, INT-P004.
3. CLARESCE^3 Pass 3 — Annealment: Top 20 priority stack, dependency DAG, 10 dispatch commands, Ajna recovery roadmap, SOVEREIGN decision batch, ledger corrections, webapp dispatch brief. IntentionLink: INT-1202, INT-1612.

**Decisions Made**:
- All external agent workloads absorbed by Commander (risk mitigation per plan)
- INT-1201 recommended reclassification from "failed" to "decomposed"
- SOVEREIGN-009 identified as single highest-impact bottleneck
- DYN-BACKLOG recommended transition to snapshot-only (Linear becomes authoritative)

**Artifacts Created**:

- `CLARESCENCE-2026-02-09-claresce3-pass2-alignment.md` (335 lines)
