## Neo-Teleologization Settlement

The disruption of Claude Code + OpenClaw created a need to re-settle the teleological framework. Key elements:

1. **Live CANON ticker**: Dynamic model/capability/economics tracking (quarterly frontier releases, open-source proliferation, visual/audio/simulation expansion, scholarly tools)
2. **IIC ledger buildout**: Structured relational data for each constellation and memory component
3. **Memory architecture formalization**: `memory-architecture-teleology.md` (P0) is the definitive source not yet in CANON
4. **Stack teleology completion**: "FINAL BOSS IS THE PALANTIR-LIKE ONTOLOGY" — map incumbent SaaS, macOS apps, backend, hardware against Syncrescendence roles
5. **Scope expansion roadmap**: Visual (image/vid/anim/avatar-gen), audio (music, conversational), world/simulation models, scholarly/academic tools
