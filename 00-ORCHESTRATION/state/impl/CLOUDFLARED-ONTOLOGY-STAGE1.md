# Cloudflared Ontology Stage 1

**Date**: 2026-03-02  
**Purpose**: Cloudflare Tunnel cutover path for exposing the ontology API without relying on direct inbound networking

## Why This Exists

Direct DNS resolution alone is not enough if the local machine is not yet reachable from the public Internet on `443`.

`cloudflared` gives a narrower Stage 1 path:

- keep the ontology API local on `127.0.0.1:8787`
- keep Caddy local on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
- let Cloudflare Tunnel carry `syncrescendence.com` traffic to the local proxy

This preserves the current boundary contract:

- repo remains authority
- ontology remains projection
- domain remains typed API surface
- no dashboard or second write path is introduced

## Current Local Prerequisites

These are already true on this machine:

- `cloudflared` is installed
- ontology API is healthy on `127.0.0.1:8787`
- local Caddy proxy is healthy on `http://localhost:8080/health`
- Cloudflare account and zone exist for `syncrescendence.com`

## Completed On This Machine

These are already complete:

1. `cloudflared tunnel login`
   - created `~/.cloudflared/cert.pem`

2. `cloudflared tunnel create syncrescendence-ontology`
   - created tunnel `d3a8d735-a776-46ab-9dbf-ab7b87ec4cf2`

3. tunnel DNS routing
   - apex and `www` were routed through Cloudflare Tunnel

4. local tunnel config
   - `~/.cloudflared/config.yml` points both hostnames at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

5. edge verification
   - direct edge health probes succeed even when the default macOS resolver is still stale
   - public API routes are reachable through the tunnel-backed domain once the local Caddy origin matches the tunneled host header

## Remaining Local Hardening

1. Keep the tunnel running under a local supervisor:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --config ~/.cloudflared/config.yml run syncrescendence-ontology
```

On this machine, the persistent path is a local LaunchAgent:

- label: `com.syncrescendence.cloudflared-ontology`
- config: `~/.cloudflared/config.yml`

2. Refresh the repo-safe readiness snapshot:

```bash
make tooling-surface-status
make ontology-domain-health-edge
```

## Historical Setup Path

These were the one-time setup steps used to reach the current state:

1. Authenticate `cloudflared` with Cloudflare:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
```

This opens a browser authorization flow and creates `~/.cloudflared/cert.pem`.

2. Create a named tunnel:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel create syncrescendence-ontology
```

3. Copy the generated tunnel UUID into:

- `00-ORCHESTRATION/state/impl/cloudflared-ontology.yml.example`

4. Route DNS through the tunnel:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns syncrescendence-ontology syncrescendence.com
cloudflared tunnel route dns syncrescendence-ontology www.syncrescendence.com
```

5. Run the tunnel against the local Caddy proxy:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --config /Users/system/syncrescendence/00-ORCHESTRATION/state/impl/cloudflared-ontology.yml.example run syncrescendence-ontology
```

6. After `https://syncrescendence.com/health` is healthy, switch selected event projection to the domain path.

## Verification

Local:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/health
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

Public:

```bash
make ontology-domain-health-edge
```

Repo-safe status:

```bash
make tooling-surface-status
```

## What This Does Not Solve

- local OS resolver lag after DNS changes
- Zero Trust / Access policy, which is optional and downstream for this API-first stage
