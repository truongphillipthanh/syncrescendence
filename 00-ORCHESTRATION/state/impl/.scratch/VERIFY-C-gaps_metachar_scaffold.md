## MISSING (in digest but absent from v2)

- **Narrative DNA** (StarCraft/Dune/Halo/Accelerando as architectural vocabulary) — source: GAPS — v2 Section 8.1 notes "Structural role articulated" but the actual frameworks (Protoss/Zerg taxonomy, Spice scarcity, Halo governance trifurcation) are not defined; the delta table entry gives no content
- **Frontier Landscape / Competitive Context** (Gastown/Yegge, Anthropic Hivemind, TeammateTool, moat analysis) — source: GAPS — v2 lists these only as P2 gaps (Section 7.5); no content on what these reveal architecturally or why Syncrescendence's moat is defensible
- **Progressive Disclosure as formal access pattern** (INT-1701) — source: GAPS — v2 does not define this as an ontology access verb; absent from action type taxonomy
- **Judgment Engineering as computable governance** (INT-1702) — source: GAPS — mentioned nowhere in v2
- **Anti-Tool-Shaped-Object gate concept** (INT-1704) — source: GAPS — not in v2 action types or governance layer
- **Data Layer Sovereignty / ontology assets as owned objects** (INT-1706) — source: GAPS — Asset class in v2 is present but the specific framing of "Rosetta Stone + ontology.db as proprietary assets with ownership" is absent
- **Knowledge-Code Isomorphism** (INT-P021: Vault index = skill discovery = ontological surface) — source: GAPS — absent from v2
- **Constellation pattern as emergent consensus / competitive positioning** (INT-P022) — source: GAPS — not incorporated
- **Agent Auto-Recovery as state transition sequence** (INT-P025) — source: GAPS — not in v2
- **Gemini unique contribution: "Context-as-a-Service"** (ontology hydrates context instantly on project thought) — source: METACHAR — divergence table in v2 names it but only as a label; the design implication is not developed
- **Grok framing: security as immune response / ethical boundary** — source: METACHAR — Grok's functional decomposition (security = self from not-self enforcement) is architecturally significant for SecurityBoundary design; absent from v2 security object type definitions
- **DC-005 agent reliability sub-state** (health vs reliability distinction; agent object type needs reliability sub-state beyond binary up/down) — source: GAPS — v2 covers agent health in Section 4.2 status column but does not add reliability sub-state to the agent object type
- **DC-011 Annotation as Action Type** (Enrich, Annotate, PromoteStatus) — source: GAPS — not in v2 action type additions
- **DC-014 MCP machine-residency attribute** (MCP Server objects need machine-residency to route correctly) — source: GAPS — not addressed in v2 Section 4.5
- **DC-015 EscalationQueue as object type with its own state machine** — source: GAPS — EscalationQueue is listed as a V2 object type in Section 3.5 but its state machine is not defined
- **Shared rate limit pool as modeled ontological constraint** (Psyche + Adjudicator share ChatGPT Plus daily limit) — source: GAPS — RateLimitPool object is defined in v2 Section 3.5 but the specific shared-pool coordination logic is only noted in Section 4.2; not in object type definitions
- **DYN-SYSTEM_STATE.json identified as dead weight** (15-day stale, contradictory data) — source: SCAFFOLD — not flagged or actioned in v2
- **"Oracle" terminology dual-usage unresolved** (session numbering vs deprecated Grok role) — source: SCAFFOLD — v2 Section 8.2 retires Oracle-Executor for clarescence role but does not address the session-numbering usage collision
- **ClickUp RSK-015 zero execution risk** — source: SCAFFOLD — v2 Section 4.8 mentions "low ROI" but the risk register entry (high probability, near-zero execution) is not surfaced
- **ARCH-AUTOMATION_MASTER_PLAN.md stale on watch_dispatch** — source: SCAFFOLD — v2 does not flag that the master plan doc is contradicting itself (lists deprecated watch_dispatch as operational)
- **Research pipeline (14-category notebook partition, P-0001 through P-0014)** — source: SCAFFOLD — not mentioned in v2; represents a significant new capability (267 files, 4 parallel agents) with no ontological object representation

---

## PARTIAL (mentioned but underrepresented in v2)

- **Narrative DNA** — v2 Section 8.1 delta table says "Structural role articulated" but the actual StarCraft/Dune/Halo frameworks are not defined anywhere in v2; the entry is a pointer, not content
- **METACHAR Tier 3 objects** (Memory versioned/provenance-tagged, Policy/Rule as governance kernel, Health state as biological object, Environment/Context) — v2 entity taxonomy includes ENV and a few others but does not surface these explicitly as Tier 3 candidates with the METACHAR sourcing
- **INT-1612 vs kernel-first tension** — v2 Section 8.5 names it as an unresolved tension and proposes "build incrementally in parallel" but does not define what "incrementally" means or give any sequencing guidance
- **HighCommand/Agendizer** — v2 flags it as P0 audit requirement in Sections 6.3 and 7.3 but the delta table entry (Section 8.1) says only "Already implements OntologyClass enum — audit before building"; no audit has occurred and v2 gives no path forward
- **METACHAR build-path recommendations** (Anytype, Sanity.io, Neo4j, Cognee, HASH, Protégé — specific substrate options) — v2 Section 3.4 lists "closest prosumer substrate" as a divergence point but does not present any of the specific tools with their architectural rationale; the content from METACHAR is compressed to labels only
- **Agent reliability sub-state / health vs reliability distinction** — v2 Section 6.1 Theme 5 names the gap but does not translate it into an object type change; agent object type in Section 3.5 is unchanged
- **Four-Systems implementation status** (most IMPL-A-0016 through IMPL-A-0025 items at `status: new`) — v2 Section 7.4 lists the four object types but does not note that implementation is near-zero; presents as designed and defined when it is mostly aspirational
- **DC-013 (4 CLAUDE.md protocol changes, 0% delivery)** — v2 Section 6.3 lists it as a persistent gap but does not enumerate the 4 changes or assess which remain valid vs superseded

---

## VERDICT: GAPS-FOUND

v2 achieves strong coverage of the METACHAR corpus (all 10 universal convergence points, all 7 divergence points, full object type taxonomy from all four models) and covers the major GAPS findings (security domain, token economics, supersede pattern, DC enumeration, HighCommand flag). The SCAFFOLD digest is well-represented in Sections 4.1-4.8. However, meaningful gaps remain: Narrative DNA is acknowledged but empty; the Frontier Landscape competitive context is deferred with no content; 4-5 specific INTentions (INT-1701, INT-1702, INT-1704, INT-P021, INT-P025) are absent from the entity and action taxonomies; the stale DYN-SYSTEM_STATE.json, the dual-Oracle terminology collision, and the research pipeline (267 files, 14-category partition) are unaddressed. None of these are blocking to kernel crystallization but the Narrative DNA absence is the largest structural omission — it was cited as P1 in GAPS and v2 offers no actual content.
