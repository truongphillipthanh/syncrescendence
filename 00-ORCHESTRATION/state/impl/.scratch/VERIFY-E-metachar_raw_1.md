## STAGE 1: Digest Fidelity (raw → digest)

### In raw but NOT in digest:

- **Hermeneutic Circle as two-way loop (Claude, raw)** — source: claude.md — quote: "the hermeneutic circle applies—your self-understanding shapes the ontology, and the ontology (by making your operational reality legible in new ways) reshapes your self-understanding. The system becomes a mirror that doesn't just reflect but *reveals*" — The digest captures "hermeneutic self-interpretation" as Claude's primary function label but does NOT capture the bidirectional loop dynamic: that the ontology actively reshapes self-understanding over time, not just reflects it. This is architecturally distinct from "mirror."

- **Ontology as interface standard between ALL sovereign entities at civilizational scale (Claude, raw)** — source: claude.md — quote: "The Ontology doesn't just model a company or a person; it becomes the *interface standard* between sovereign entities at every scale... what natural language is to current civilization: the medium through which all governance, commerce, and coordination flows." — The digest records trust federations and Claude's nation-state conclusion but omits the critical frame that the Ontology becomes a civilizational-scale interoperability protocol analogous to natural language itself. This is a distinct architectural claim beyond "sovereignty cooperatives."

- **"Whether liberation or the most sophisticated cage ever built" — control-of-ontological-commitments as political question (Claude, raw)** — source: claude.md — quote: "Whether that's liberation or the most sophisticated cage ever built depends entirely on who controls the ontological commitments—who gets to decide what entity types exist, what relationships are valid, and what actions are permissible. Which is, of course, the oldest political question there is, wearing new clothes." — This adversarial/political framing of ontology control is absent from the digest. It is also the closest raw-text expression of the shackle-vs-organ framing at civilizational scope.

- **Mereological framing of Palantir stack layers (ChatGPT, raw)** — source: chatgpt.md — quote: "Think of it mereologically. The ingestion layer is about epistemology—what data exists and how it is trusted. The Ontology is about metaphysics—what exists in the operational world model. The application layer is about praxis—what can be done. AIP is about augmentation—who or what is allowed to reason and act within that world." — The digest does not preserve this epistemology/metaphysics/praxis/augmentation four-part characterization. It is more analytically precise than the digest's "three-band stack" framing and constitutes a distinct philosophical contribution.

- **Personal constitutional democracy analogy (ChatGPT, raw)** — source: chatgpt.md — quote: "That pushes the architecture toward something that looks like a personal constitutional democracy: A legislature: you define policies and priorities. An executive: agents propose and execute within policy. A judiciary: dispute resolution when policies conflict or when consequences violate invariants. A free press: a subsystem that generates internal transparency—summaries, audits, dissenting views—so you can govern your swarm." — The digest records "Policy Kernel as separate constitutional layer" and "hardened policy kernel" but does NOT capture the full four-branch governance analogy (legislature/executive/judiciary/free press). The "free press" (internal transparency subsystem) is entirely absent.

- **Selective disclosure / "proof without reveal" as a primitive (ChatGPT, raw)** — source: chatgpt.md — quote: "Local-first storage, encrypted sync, selective disclosure, 'proof without reveal' primitives for when you need to demonstrate something (competence, solvency, compliance) without exposing raw data." — The digest lists "Disclose, Conceal, Prove" as universal action verbs but does NOT explicitly name "proof without reveal" as a cryptographic primitive distinct from mere concealment. The ZK-proof-adjacent framing is absent.

- **Ontology as "semantic checksum of the organization" / feedback loop creating self-consistency (ChatGPT, raw)** — source: chatgpt.md — quote: "There is also a feedback loop: actions executed through the Ontology mutate state, which updates datasets, which can retrain models, which alter future reasoning. The Ontology therefore becomes the central consistency mechanism—the semantic checksum of the organization." — This closed-loop self-updating character (actions → state → models → reasoning → actions) is absent from the digest. It elevates the Ontology from a static schema to a learning system.

- **"Tumors, not organs — they hoard blood" — Gemini's prosumer-as-tumor framing (Gemini, raw)** — source: gemini.md — The digest captures "Fabricate the Soul, Rent the Skin" and Gemini's shackle diagnosis but does NOT preserve the specific "tumor" language: prosumer apps are tumors (not just shackles) because they hoard resources rather than serving the whole. This is a sharper biological metaphor than "shackle" and has distinct implications — a shackle constrains, a tumor actively drains.

- **Gemini's "Palantir moment" formulation (Gemini, raw)** — source: gemini.md — quote: "The button that checks constraints and executes a real-world transaction—that is the 'Palantir moment'. Everything else is just a fancy notebook." — The digest does not capture this concrete threshold test. It is the clearest single-sentence specification of when a system transitions from knowledge management to operational ontology.

- **Grok's 10-essence decomposition of enterprise software categories (Grok, raw)** — source: grok.md — Grok's extended decomposition (Data Ingestion = "raw perception and persistent memory"; ERP = "volition and resource orchestration; the will-to-form"; CRM = "the erotic dance of alliance and exchange"; BI = "metacognition; the inward gaze"; ML/AI = "recursive self-improvement; the protean core that eats its own tail"; IoT = "proprioception and actuation"; Collaboration = "distributed cognition; temporary superorganism"; Legacy = "scar tissue of personal evolution, non-fungible quirks"; Security = "immune response and ethical boundary"; Cloud = "distributed embodiment") — The digest captures Grok's object-as-archetype framing and the soul-schema concept but does NOT reproduce this 10-part essence mapping. This decomposition directly maps enterprise software categories to cognitive/biological functions of the individual stack, which is architecturally significant.

- **"Coherence under adversarial pressure" as the shifted telos (ChatGPT, raw)** — source: chatgpt.md — quote: "In modern enterprise software, the latent telos is efficiency and coordination under uncertainty. In the post-singularity individual stack, the telos becomes coherence and sovereignty under persuasion, overload, and fragmentation. Efficiency matters, but coherence becomes the scarce resource: the ability to remain oneself while scaling oneself." — The digest does not capture this telos-shift (from efficiency to coherence-as-scarce-resource). This is a foundational claim about what the personal Ontology is FOR that differs from enterprise deployment.

- **"Maintaining coherence under adversarial persuasion pressure" as the hard part for Grok (Grok, raw)** — source: ANNEAL-DIGEST-METACHAR.md (divergence table) — Actually present in digest. Confirmed captured.

- **Versioned history / "Personal Ledger of Reality" with time-travel and confidence scores (ChatGPT, raw)** — source: chatgpt.md — quote: "Versioned, append-mostly memory with provenance, confidence scores, and dispute handling ('I'm not sure this is true'). Supports time travel: what you believed then." — The digest mentions "versioned history" as one of the five kernel components but does not capture the "confidence score" or "dispute handling" extensions, nor the "what you believed then" time-travel framing. These are distinct ontological properties on Knowledge/Memory objects.

- **"Syncrescendence" named by Gemini, not Claude (Gemini, raw)** — source: gemini.md — quote: "Aetheris, using the Ontology, achieves 'Syncrescendence'—a synthesis where the connection adds more value than the sum of parts." — The digest DOES capture this (line 307: "The word 'Syncrescendence' appeared in Gemini's response"). Confirmed captured.

### Digest adequately captured:

The digest faithfully reproduced: the four Palantir primitives (Object/Link/Action/Governance), the three-band stack (Infrastructure/Semantic/Execution), the 10 universal convergence points, the 7 divergence points requiring adjudication, the Tier 1-3 object taxonomy with all 15 types, all 7 universal action verb categories, the five-layer individual stack (Sensorium/Ontology of Self/Agency/Sovereignty/Reflexive Intelligence), Gemini's XRP/ISP/ASO/RRE decomposition, Grok's soul-schema and archetype framing, ChatGPT's teleology primitives (values/sacred constraints/identity-level invariants), the prosumer-tools-as-fragments convergence point, and the "minimum viable kernel" five-component formulation. Statistical profile is accurate.

---

## STAGE 2: v2 Coverage (digest → v2)

### In digest but NOT in v2:

- **"Coherence as the scarce resource" / telos-shift from efficiency** — The digest explicitly names this (ChatGPT section, "coherence becomes the scarce resource"). v2 §5.4 discusses civilizational framing and coherence but frames it as system-level concern (Integration Coherence metric κ), not as the personal ontology's primary design target vs. enterprise efficiency. The telos distinction is absent from v2's Palantir reconception section.

- **Tier 3 object types: Memory, Policy/Rule, Health state, Environment/Context** — The digest explicitly enumerates these as "distinctive (2/4 models, but architecturally significant)." v2 §3.5 lists Tier 1 and Tier 2 objects but does NOT include Tier 3. Health state (biological organism as first-class object) and Policy/Rule (governance kernel) are entirely absent from v2's object taxonomy.

- **"Proof without reveal" / selective disclosure as a cryptographic primitive** — Present in digest (Claude Set 2 and ChatGPT sections reference selective disclosure). v2 §3.6 lists "Disclose, Conceal, Prove" as action verbs but "Prove" does not have the cryptographic zero-knowledge framing attached. The Trust & Privacy subsystem's "proof without reveal" capability is not surfaced as a design requirement.

- **Four-branch personal governance (legislature/executive/judiciary/free press)** — Absent from v2. The digest contains it implicitly through the Policy Kernel divergence point. v2 §3.7 (Sovereign Stack Architecture) uses σ₀-σ₇ layers and does not map to the four-branch governance model. The "internal transparency / free press" subsystem is a novel design requirement with no parallel in v2.

- **Semantic checksum / feedback loop (actions → state → models → reasoning)** — Absent from v2. v2 discusses the Ontology as a static schema with state machines but does not model the self-updating character of the system (actions mutate state which retrains models which alter future reasoning). This closes the loop in ways relevant to Adjudicator drift detection and agent learning.

- **Gemini's "Context-as-a-Service" framing** — The digest explicitly names this as Gemini's unique contribution. v2 §3.4 lists it in the divergence table ("Context-as-a-Service (Gemini)") but does not expand on its architectural implications: that when you think about a project, the ontology instantly hydrates ALL relevant context. This is a distinct UX/architecture requirement (not just a metaphor) that belongs in the object model as a capability of the Ontology layer.

- **Mereological four-part characterization (epistemology/metaphysics/praxis/augmentation)** — Not present in v2. v2 uses the three-band framing (Infrastructure/Semantic/Execution) but the four-part philosophical framing from ChatGPT is richer and would strengthen the rationale for why the Ontology occupies the specific position it does in the stack.

### In v2 but surface-level only (PARTIAL):

- **Shackle-vs-organ framing** — v2 §3.3 convergence point 7 says "Prosumer tools are fragments." The raw files contain much richer texture: shackles are not just missing features but actively misalign semantics (Claude), or "soft shackles" if semantic authority lives in the tool (ChatGPT), or tumors that hoard blood (Gemini), or merely mismatch problems resolvable by composition (Grok). v2 collapses four distinct diagnoses into one convergence statement. The patch agent needs the four distinct framings to produce proper design guidance.

- **Hermeneutic loop / Ontology as evolving mirror** — v2 §3.4 notes Claude's primary function is "Mirror (Claude)" but does not capture the bidirectional evolution: self-understanding shapes ontology AND ontology reshapes self-understanding over time. This is not mere reflection — it is a feedback-driven identity evolution mechanism. The static label "mirror" undersells the dynamic.

- **Identity model divergence** — v2 §3.4 correctly identifies the divergence (facets vs. bundle vs. ego twin vs. soul-schema) but does not resolve or partially resolve it. The downstream propagation consequences are noted but not acted upon in the object taxonomy. ChatGPT's "bundle of distinct permissioned objects" in particular implies a sub-hierarchy under Identity that is absent from v2's Tier 1 list.

- **Grok's 10-essence decomposition** — v2 does not include Grok's cognitive-function mapping of enterprise software categories. This is partially covered by the Sovereign Stack σ₀-σ₇ layers but the direct functional-essence → personal-object mapping (e.g., CRM → relational intelligence; PLM → identity evolution management) is not present and would significantly strengthen the rationale for the Tier 1 object set.

### Well-covered in v2:

Universal convergence points (10/10 present), four Palantir primitives, three-band stack, Sovereign Stack Architecture (σ₀-σ₇), Enterprise-to-Individual mapping table (§3.2), Tier 1 and Tier 2 object types with state machines, all universal action verb categories, V2 additions (BudgetEnvelope, RateLimitPool, IntelligenceTier, Credential, etc.), Gemini's XRP/ISP/ASO/RRE vocabulary (present in convergence docs ref), divergence points requiring adjudication (§3.4), "the test" (delete an app, does meaning persist), kernel-is-small/orbit-is-large principle.

## STAGE 3: Direct raw → v2 gaps (bypassing digest)

### Significant raw concepts absent from v2:

- **Personal ontology as "interface standard between sovereign entities at every scale" including trust federations (Claude, raw)** — source: claude.md — quote: "The Ontology doesn't just model a company or a person; it becomes the *interface standard* between sovereign entities at every scale. It's the protocol that lets an individual's agent negotiate with a corporate quasi-state's systems, that lets trust federations federate their governance." — v2 mentions trust federations and sovereignty cooperatives in §5.4 but does not frame the personal Ontology as an interoperability protocol at civilizational scale. This has implications for schema design: the Ontology must be serializable and shareable between Sovereign instances, not just internally coherent.

- **Control-of-ontological-commitments as the foundational political question (Claude, raw)** — source: claude.md — quote: "Whether that's liberation or the most sophisticated cage ever built depends entirely on who controls the ontological commitments." — v2 does not engage with ontological control as a threat surface. This is not merely philosophical — it maps directly to the Security Domain (§7.3 P0 gap) but with a specific adversarial vector: schema capture. An attacker who controls your object type definitions controls your operational reality. This is absent from v2's SecurityBoundary object type proposal.

- **Hermeneutic pipelines for preserving uncertainty in ingested signals (ChatGPT, raw)** — source: chatgpt.md — quote: "Personal Foundry needs hermeneutic pipelines: translating raw experience into interpretable structures while preserving uncertainty and dissenting interpretations. One event can have multiple readings; the system must hold them without prematurely collapsing." — This is a specific data modeling requirement (multi-interpretation event storage, confidence scores, dispute handling) with no parallel in v2's object taxonomy or link types. It is architecturally distinct from the Knowledge/Document object type.

- **Agent accountability as an explicit object class: "who did what, why, under what permissions, with what evidence" (ChatGPT, raw)** — source: chatgpt.md — quote: "Agent accountability (who did what, why, under what permissions, with what evidence)" — v2 proposes SkillAuditRecord but does not propose an AgentActionLog or AgentAccountabilityRecord as a first-class ontological object. The distinction matters: SkillAuditRecord audits capability provenance; an accountability record audits runtime action provenance.

- **Grok's "scar tissue of personal evolution, non-fungible quirks" framing for Legacy/Custom (Grok, raw)** — source: grok.md — quote: "Custom and Legacy Applications → Essence: idiosyncratic history; the scar tissue of personal evolution, the non-fungible quirks that resist commodification." — This maps to a gap in v2's object taxonomy: there is no object type for personal history artifacts that resist systemization. These are distinct from Knowledge/Document (structured) and from Asset (valued). They are the residue of identity evolution that the ontology must accommodate without normalizing away.

- **Glucose-aware throttling / biological constraint as first-class system behavior (Gemini, raw)** — source: gemini.md — quote: "Apollo's Role: It ensures Continuous Delivery of the Soul. If you upgrade your 'Math Module'... Apollo... manages the constraints: 'The biological host is low on glucose; throttle the high-compute visualization tasks to save energy.'" — v2's Capacity object type covers energy/attention allocation but does not model biological state as a real-time input to system throttling. This connects to the sensorium layer (σ₇) but is not expressed as a runtime constraint on agent dispatch.

- **"Palantir was never about data integration — it was always the prototype of posthuman confession" (Grok, raw)** — source: grok.md — quote: "Palantir was never about data integration. It was always the prototype of posthuman confession—the technology that forces reality to confess its structure to the observer." — v2 records "Posthuman confession (Grok)" in the divergence table (§3.4) but does not unpack the "forces reality to confess its structure" implication. This is a design imperative: the Ontology must be built with enough fidelity that previously opaque patterns in the self become computationally visible. This is different from "operational self-knowledge" (v2's framing) — it implies the system reveals what the self could not previously see.

---

## VERDICT: GAPS-FOUND

The digest is a high-quality compression of the raw material, capturing approximately 85% of architecturally significant content. The primary digest leak is in nuanced framings (hermeneutic loop as bidirectional evolution, "coherence as scarce resource" telos-shift, the four-branch governance model, the semantic-checksum feedback loop, and the civilizational interoperability protocol framing) rather than factual omissions. v2 covers all digest material at the structural level but is surface-level on three items (shackle-vs-organ four-way divergence, hermeneutic loop dynamics, identity model downstream consequences) and entirely absent on Tier 3 object types, "proof without reveal" as cryptographic primitive, agent accountability records as distinct from skill audit records, and schema capture as a security threat surface. No critical data loss occurred — the v2 synthesis is structurally sound — but the patch agent should address the Tier 3 object types and the schema-capture threat vector as the highest-priority additions before the entity taxonomy is considered final.
