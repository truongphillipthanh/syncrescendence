## Summary Verdict: GAPS-FOUND — Core Architecture Sound, Patchable

v2's structural skeleton is faithful. All 10 universal convergence points, all 7 divergence
points, full Tier 1+2 object taxonomy, Sovereign Stack, Tri-Helical Strategy, Scaffold state,
and Clarescence themes are correctly synthesized. No foundational distortion found.

**8 patches required.** All are additive — no corrections to existing content.
Current v2: 765 lines. Ceiling: 800 lines. Available: 35 lines.
Estimated addition: ~32 lines. Post-patch target: ~797 lines.

## Triage: What Is NOT Patchable to v2 (Scope Boundaries)

The following Lane A and B gaps are REAL but belong in CANON files or REF docs,
NOT in an ontology synthesis document. These are operational/practitioner-level protocols:

- CANON-0X: ASIA Federation constitution, Two-Stream Architecture, Face Fluency Assessment,
  Vertical Integration Protocols, Batch Production Protocol, Reconstructive Capacity/80% Test,
  Dimensional Coordinator Progression, Synthesis Sequence phases, Intellectual Lineage (13 tributaries)
- CANON-1X2X: IIC Memory Profiles per chain, Seven Cross-Layer Integration Matrices,
  Oracle Pedigree Protocol, Resonance Phenomenon
- CANON-31: Daily Intelligence Cycle, Recommendation Scoring System, Dual-Stream 80/20,
  14 Rhetorical Anti-Patterns, Five Voice Principles, Tone Library Production Workflow
- CANON-32-35: AuDHD sub-patterns, Mastery Syllabus cadence, Consulting revenue tiers,
  Seven Coherence Pitfalls, Three Coherence Modalities, Progressive Trust Model
- Lane F competitive landscape: Celonis OCPM, Stardog, Anduril Lattice, C3.ai analysis
  (P2 — intellectual capital, survives in raw inbox; future CANON/SOURCE file)

DC-004 (Rosetta Stone ~25 terms): separate commitment, target 2026-02-18. Not here.

## PATCH-001 — Tier 3 Object Types (Ontological Taxonomy Completeness)
**Priority**: P0 | **Source**: VERIFY-E (Lane E), VERIFY-F (Lane F), VERIFY-C
**Section**: §3.5 — after Tier 2 object types table
**Gap**: v2 lists Tier 1 (7 types) and Tier 2 (5 types) but stops. All four LLMs independently
proposed Tier 3 types (2/4 model convergence = "architecturally significant"). Entity taxonomy
is incomplete without them.

**Content to add** (after the Tier 2 table, before §3.6):

```
### Tier 3: Architecturally Significant (2/4 model convergence)
| Type | Description | Sovereignty Notes |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Memory | Versioned knowledge state; provenance-tagged; supports confidence scores, dispute-handling, time-travel ("what you believed then") | Distinct from Knowledge/Document: Memory is the living state, not the artifact |
| Policy/Rule | Governance kernel; defines permissible actions, invariants, identity-level constraints | The legislature in a personal constitutional democracy |
| Health State | Biological state as first-class ontological object; connects Capacity object to σ₇ Sensorium | Enables glucose-aware throttling; biological constraint on agent dispatch |
| Environment/Context | Situational hydration surface; enables Context-as-a-Service: when you think of a project, all relevant context instantiates | Gemini's unique architectural contribution |

## PATCH-002 — Schema Capture as Security Threat Vector
**Priority**: P0 | **Source**: VERIFY-E (Lane E), claude.md raw
**Section**: §7.3 (Security Domain) — after existing SecurityBoundary description
**Gap**: v2 defines SecurityBoundary and Credential objects but does not name schema capture
as a distinct adversarial threat. This is distinct from credential theft — it is ontological capture.

**Content to add** (in §7.3 Security Domain section, after SecurityBoundary definition):

```
**Schema Capture (P0 threat surface)**: An actor who controls object type definitions —
what entity types exist, what relationships are valid, what actions are permissible —
controls the operational reality of the Sovereign. This is the foundational political
question of ontology deployment. The SecurityBoundary object must enforce schema
sovereignty: only the Sovereign may define or modify the canonical entity taxonomy.
```

## PATCH-003 — "Coherence as Scarce Resource" Telos-Shift
**Priority**: P0 | **Source**: VERIFY-E, chatgpt.md raw (R1)
**Section**: §3.1 or §3.3 — after "personal Palantir" framing
**Gap**: v2 establishes the personal Palantir thesis but does not name the foundational telos
distinction between enterprise and individual deployment: enterprise targets efficiency; personal
ontology targets coherence (remaining oneself while scaling oneself).

**Content to add** (in §3.1 or §3.3 near convergence point discussion):

```
**Telos distinction**: Enterprise Palantir targets efficiency and coordination under
uncertainty. The personal Ontology targets coherence under persuasion, overload, and
fragmentation — remaining oneself while scaling oneself. *Coherence is the scarce
resource*, not compute or storage. This distinction governs every design decision.
```

## PATCH-004 — Lens Mutation Archaeology in §6 (Clarescence Self-Finding)
**Priority**: P1 | **Source**: VERIFY-D, ANNEAL-DIGEST-CLARESCENCE.md (DEC-CONV-003)
**Section**: §6 (Clarescence Synthesis) — after dual-path lens system mention, or new §6.5
**Gap**: v2 §8.1 labels "Dual-Path Lens System" as a new concept but §6 (Clarescence Synthesis)
does not capture lens mutation archaeology as a KEY META-FINDING of the clarescence process:
that the lenses themselves drifted across sessions, and that drift was only discovered through
forensic meta-clarescence.

**Content to add** (new §6.5 or addition to §6.4 emergent patterns):

```
**Lens Mutation Archaeology** (DEC-CONV-003): Forensic analysis of 23 clarescence sessions
revealed 6 discrete lens mutation events producing 117 distinct lens names. Lenses drifted
without tracking, creating silent inconsistency. The Dual-Path Lens System (v3.0.0) is the
result. Record at: LENS-ARCHAEOLOGY.md. Pattern: frameworks mutate unless archaeologically
anchored.
```

## PATCH-005 — "Repeatedly Slipped" as Distinct Failure Category
**Priority**: P1 | **Source**: VERIFY-D, ANNEAL-DIGEST-CLARESCENCE.md
**Section**: §6.3 (Persistent Gaps) or §6.4 (Emergent Patterns)
**Gap**: v2 §6.3 lists Persistent Gaps (DC-004, DC-002, DC-003, etc.) but does not distinguish
"Repeatedly Slipped" items — things committed to multiple times across sessions that consistently
fail to execute. This is a different failure mode from gap identification.

**Content to add** (§6.3 or §6.4 — new paragraph or pattern):

```
**Repeatedly Slipped category** (distinct from Persistent Gaps): Items committed to in ≥3
sessions, never executed: chezmoi (built, never activated), Agent Pipe (designed Feb 8,
never turned on), Notion config (SYN-59), Discord/Slack (SYN-50), anti-shelfware lint,
SQLite↔Airtable sync. Pattern diagnosis: high intention, low activation energy → activation
problem, not a planning problem.
```

## PATCH-006 — DEC-SAAS-006 Architectural Constraint (Anthropic OAuth)
**Priority**: P1 | **Source**: VERIFY-D, ANNEAL-DIGEST-CLARESCENCE.md
**Section**: §4.2 (Constellation Agent Model) — after Ajna model assignment
**Gap**: v2 §4.2 states Ajna uses "Kimi K2.5 via NVIDIA NIM" but does not explain WHY.
DEC-SAAS-006 established this as a hard architectural constraint: Anthropic OAuth is blocked
for OpenClaw agents using Claude Max. This is load-bearing for anyone debugging agent assignments.

**Content to add** (§4.2, after Ajna model assignment):

```
**DEC-SAAS-006**: Ajna uses Kimi K2.5 (not Claude) because Anthropic OAuth is blocked for
Claude Max in the OpenClaw architecture. OpenClaw cannot authenticate to Claude models through
its API integration. This is a hard constraint, not a preference.
```

## PATCH-007 — Event Sourcing + Directionality Test (Kernel Build Vocabulary)
**Priority**: P1 | **Source**: VERIFY-F, gemini.md R2, claude.md R2
**Section**: §3.3 (after convergence points) or §7 (gap analysis) or §Appendix
**Gap**: v2 lists "versioned history" as kernel component #4 but gives no implementation model.
Event sourcing (append-only ledger, state by replaying events) is the canonical mechanism.
The Directionality Test is the operational complement to the "delete the app" test — covers
active use case where the app gradually defines schema without deletion.

**Content to add** (§3.3 or new §3.8 — Kernel Build Notes):

```
**Kernel implementation note**: "Versioned History" = event sourcing (append-only ledger;
current state calculated by replaying events — how banks and Palantir work).
**Directionality test**: "If the app defines how you model your world → skeleton/shackle.
If your ontology defines your world model and the app is one interface → organ."
Complements the delete-the-app test for active-use evaluation.
```

**Estimated lines added**: 5

## PATCH-008 — "Modeling Artifacts vs Invariants" Failure Mode
**Priority**: P1 | **Source**: VERIFY-F, chatgpt.md R2
**Section**: §7 (Gap Analysis) or §3.5 (object taxonomy — as design guidance)
**Gap**: v2's entity taxonomy correctly emphasizes invariants (Commitment, Risk, Capacity) but
never names the primary ontology-building failure mode: modeling artifacts (tasks, notes,
documents) instead of invariants. This is the most common execution error for INT-MI19.

**Content to add** (§7 or §3.5):

```
**Primary failure mode — artifacts vs invariants**: Most ontology-building fails by
modeling artifacts (tasks, notes, documents) instead of invariants (commitments, capacities,
constraints, identity-level goals). Without invariants, the ontology degenerates into a
glorified CRM. The Tier 1 object set in §3.5 is invariant-first by design.
```
