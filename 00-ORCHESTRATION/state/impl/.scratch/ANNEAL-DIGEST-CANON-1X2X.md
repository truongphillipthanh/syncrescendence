## Key Entities & Concepts

### CANON-10000 — Syncrescendent Core

- **Epistemic taxonomy**: All claims marked EMPIRICAL / THEORETICAL / METAPHORICAL
- **Seven Pulses Assessment**: Daily 2-min Core health check (Foundation, Energy, Direction, Connection, Progress, Integration, Transcendence)
- **Energy State Adaptations**: Peak (70-100%), Baseline (40-70%), Depletion (20-40%), Crisis (<20%)
- **Developmental Stages**: Protostar → Main Sequence → Red Giant → Hypergiant (months to years 5+)
- **Recursive Amplification Architecture** (central theoretical claim): multi-domain practice may produce multiplicative rather than additive gains; requires empirical validation
- **Radiation Spectrum**: Core enables Acumen, Coherence, Efficacy, Mastery, Transcendence

### CANON-11000 — ModusOperandi (Five Faces)

- **Perichoretic Integration**: faces interpenetrate without confusion (Trinity analogy — three persons, one essence)
- Faces are not sequential modules; they are concurrent expressions of unified consciousness
- **Face Fluency Assessment**: ability to shift consciously, maintain contextual appropriateness, avoid chronic dominance
- Underdeveloped faces: usually Embodiment; overdeveloped: usually Meaning-Making or Sensing

### CANON-20000 — Cognitive Palace (Seven Layers)

| Layer | Name | Essential Nature | Key Sub-domains |
|-------|------|-----------------|----------------|
| 0 | Reality | Ontological bedrock / axiological | Gaialogical, Biological, Anthropological, Artificial |
| 1 | Imaginality | Teleological attraction / vision | 7 narrative domains (Ambition, Aspiration, Legacy, Aesthetic, Adventure, Discovery, Service) |
| 2 | Potentiality | Resource substrate | 9 domains (Somatic, Intellectual, Emotional, Spiritual, Material, Social, Economic, Informational, Technological) |
| 3 | Temporality | Rhythmic harmonics | Chronos/Kairos, rhythms, frequencies |
| 4 | Practicality | Operational methods | 8 practice categories (Constitutional, Habitual, Methodological, Ritual, Procedural, Improvisational, Disciplined, Ludic) |
| 5 | Actuality | Present nexus | Eternal present; all layers converge here |
| 6 | Consequentiality | Wisdom accumulation | Experience → Reflection → Insight → Integration → Application |

- Layers operate **simultaneously**, not sequentially
- **Vertical Integration Protocols**: Daily Layer Check-In (5 min), Weekly Seven-Layer Audit (20 min)

### CANON-20010 — Dimensional Coordinators

- Seven coordinators (00 Reality, 10 Imaginality, 20 Potentiality, 30 Temporality, 40 Practicality, 50 Actuality, 60 Consequentiality) each observing their dimensional frequency
- **Meta-Governor (90)**: orchestrates cross-dimensional integration; invisible by default
- **87 components** total in the Cognitive Palace system
- **Progression**: Minimal (wks 1-4) → Ambient (mo 2-3) → Partnership (mo 4-6) → Mastery (mo 7-12) → Transcendence (yr 2+)
- **Seven Cross-Layer Integration Matrices** (81-87): e.g., Reality↔Imaginality, Consequentiality↔Potentiality

### CANON-20020 — Meta-Systems (70-73)

- **Universal Resonance Field (70)**: harmonic inter-component communication
- **Pattern Library (71)**: stores life rhythms, development trajectories, relationship dynamics, creative emergence patterns
- **Seven Pulses Dashboard (72)**: Foundation, Energy, Direction, Flow, Learning, Connection, Evolution — green/yellow/red indicators
- **Adaptive Interface (73)**: context-sensitive complexity scaling (high-stress → essentials only; growth mode → expand gradually)

### CANON-21000 — Chain Interdependency Matrix

**Hard Dependencies** (cannot advance without):
- ALL chains require Intelligence Stage 1 (universal prerequisite)
- Expertise Stage 2+ requires Information Stage 2
- Knowledge Stage 2+ requires Insight Stage 2
- Wisdom Stage 2+ requires ALL chains Stage 2, Insight Stage 3, Knowledge Stage 2
- Any Stage 4 (teaching) requires Wisdom Stage 2+

**Dual-Track System**:
- **Synchronization Track**: all chains advance together (best for generalists / neurotypical)
- **Specialization Track**: 2-3 strength chains to Stage 3+, maintain Stage 1 baseline in others (best for specialists / neurodivergent)

**Intelligence Chain dual ontology**: simultaneously foundational substrate (non-local, enables all) AND its own 4-stage developmental trajectory (Text → Vision → Physical → Full Integration)

### CANON-21100 — Tri-Helical Timeline

Three synchronized timelines:
1. **Technological Maturity** (external, uncontrollable): Text AI 85% → Vision AI 40-70% → Physical AI 20-50%
2. **Business Development** (high control): Foundation → Validation → Scaling → Institute → Infrastructure phases
3. **Personal Capability** (medium control, cannot force): current skills → HVAC competence → cross-trade mastery

Decision logic: all three timelines must align before acting on any major capability claim.

### CANON-22000 — Interference Pattern & Synthesis Dynamics

- **Constructive interference** (chains at complementary levels): amplification ~200%, potentially exponential for all-six alignment
- **Destructive interference** (mismatched chain levels): overwhelm, burnout, intellectual complexity without wisdom
- **Primary Triads**:
  - Perception-Action (Intelligence + Information + Expertise)
  - Understanding (Information + Insight + Wisdom)
  - Integration (Insight + Knowledge + Wisdom)
- **Synthesis Sequence phases**: Foundation (Knowledge+Information) → Capability (Intelligence+Expertise) → Understanding (Insight+Wisdom) → Integration Maturity (all six)
- **Resonance Phenomenon**: all chains Level 3+ → emergent coherence beyond any single chain

### CANON-23000 — Lunar Navigation

**Five Orthogonal Dimensions** for locating practitioner position:
1. **Scale** (1-4: Micro/Meso/Macro/Meta) — sophistication, independent
2. **Level** (1-4: Initial/Intermediate/Advanced/Mastery per chain) — sequential
3. **Degree** (1-5: Recognition/Exploration/Commitment/Integration/Transmission) — Lunar systems only (Insight & Wisdom chains)
4. **Stage** (1-5) — platform/organizational maturity, independent
5. **Phase** (Foundation/Validation/Scaling/Institute/Infrastructure) — business timeline, chronological

**Three Entry Pathways**: Epistemology-first (Coherence), Ontology-first (Transcendence), Integration-first (both simultaneously)

### CANON-24000 — Omni-Quality Cultivation

Four asymptotic quality dimensions (81-100% is unreachable; target is progressive approximation):
- **Omnibenevolence**: ethical sophistication, stakeholder service, regenerative modeling
- **Omniscience**: multi-domain synthesis, meta-framework development, civilization-scale thinking
- **Omnipotence**: six causal chains developed (matches Chain Matrix Synchronization/Specialization tracks)
- **Omnipresence**: temporal integration (past/present/future), spatial integration (local/bioregional/planetary), dimensional integration (7-layer Cognitive Palace navigation)

### CANON-25000 — Memory Architecture

**Memory Sovereignty Principle**: file-system is ground truth; platform memory is operational cache.

**Seven Memory Strata** (platform-agnostic):
1. Constitutional — model weights, immutable
2. Preference — user-specified behavioral calibrations
3. Accumulated — system-generated inference from history
4. Project/Space — scoped context per workspace
5. Canonical Knowledge (RAG) — static documents for retrieval
6. Thread Context — active conversation working memory
7. Tool-Extended — MCP, APIs, filesystem (sovereign layer)

**Distillation Cascade**: Fluid (thread) → Operational (memory) → Canonical (corpus) → Eternal (constitution)

**IIC Memory Profiles** (per chain): Acumen=aggressive forgetting, Coherence=moderate, Efficacy=low for procedures, Mastery=very low, Transcendence=minimal (wisdom accumulates longest)

**Three Horizons**: Eternal (immutable principles), Canonical (stable but evolvable), Fluid (dynamic, operational)

### CANON-25100 — Context Transition Protocol

Three modes, AI-selected based on context analysis:
- **Culmination**: thread ending with value to preserve
- **Continuation**: thread boundary where work resumes
- **Compression**: context approaching limits mid-stream

**Oracle Pedigree Protocol**: decision archaeology across sessions — captures Principal's verbatim words, Oracle interpretation, 18-lens evaluation, artifacts produced.

### CANON-25200 — Platform Constellation Architecture

**Five-platform constellation** ($100/month total):
- Claude Oracle (Account 1 web) — Strategic synthesis, 18-lens decisions
- Claude Alpha (Account 2 CLI) — Primary execution engine, zone A
- Claude Beta (Account 3 CLI) — Secondary execution engine, zone B
- Gemini Advanced (1 account) — 2M context ingestion, YouTube, large corpus
- ChatGPT Plus (1 account) — GitHub @codex integration, Codex CLI, reasoning

**IIC-to-Platform Affinity**: Acumen→Gemini, Coherence→Claude Oracle, Efficacy→Claude Code, Mastery→Claude Oracle, Transcendence→Claude Oracle

**Repository as ground truth**: all platforms synchronize through git; no platform is authoritative over the repo.

## Thematic Clusters

### Cluster A: Consciousness Architecture (10000-11999)
Personal identity as unified consciousness expressing through differentiated faces/aspects. Perichoretic model: unity-through-differentiation rather than fragmentation. Recursive amplification as the central mechanism. Epistemic honesty enforced by three-category tagging (empirical/theoretical/metaphorical).

### Cluster B: Dimensional Substrate (20000-20999)
The Cognitive Palace provides the "spacetime" through which consciousness moves. Seven concurrent layers — not stages but ongoing simultaneous dimensions. Coordinated by invisible intelligence (Dimensional Coordinators); managed through resonance-based meta-systems. 87-component system that should feel like natural intuition.

### Cluster C: Chain Development Logic (21000-22999)
Six developmental chains with explicit hard/soft dependencies and stage-gating. Two valid pathways (Synchronization vs. Specialization). Timeline alignment required across technology, business, and personal capability before advancing. Interference dynamics — constructive and destructive — govern multi-chain interaction.

### Cluster D: Navigation & Assessment (23000-24999)
Progressive disclosure architecture using five orthogonal dimensions. Omni-Quality provides four aspirational horizons (omnibenevolence/omniscience/omnipotence/omnipresence) as asymptotic development targets. Three entry pathways to the deepest systems (epistemological, ontological, integration-first).

### Cluster E: Memory & Infrastructure (25000-25999)
Sovereignty-first memory philosophy. Seven memory strata organized by control and persistence. CLI-as-foyer pattern for multi-agent coordination. Context transition as a single unified protocol with AI-determined mode selection. Multi-platform constellation architecture treating repository as the only ground truth.

## Notable Patterns

### 1. Epistemic Honesty Enforcement
CANON-10000 systematically tags every claim as EMPIRICAL, THEORETICAL, or METAPHORICAL — a constitutive pattern that appears to be a design principle across the framework, preventing cosmological metaphor from being mistaken for empirical claim.

### 2. Asymptotic Targeting
Multiple systems use unreachable ideal as developmental attractor: Omni-Quality 81-100% range is labeled "never complete"; Hypergiant Stage 4 requires years 5+. The framework explicitly acknowledges incompleteness as structural, not motivational failure.

### 3. Dual-Mode Pathways Throughout
Virtually every major system offers two tracks: Synchronization/Specialization (chains), Culmination+Continuation/Compression (context transitions), Captured/Sovereign (memory), Epistemology-first/Ontology-first (Lunar Navigation). The architecture consistently resists monoculture.

### 4. Invisible-by-Default Intelligence
Dimensional Coordinators (CANON-20010) and Meta-Systems (CANON-20020) are explicitly designed to feel like "natural intuition" rather than a system. The 87 Cognitive Palace components should produce no system-awareness in the practitioner. This design philosophy recurs in the Adaptive Interface system.

### 5. Numbering Schema
CANON IDs follow a structured pattern: 10000-11999 = Core tier; 20000-25999 = Lattice tier. Satellites of the Palace use 200xx pattern (20010, 20020). Children of chains/lattices extend their parent's number (21000 → 21100; 25000 → 25100/25200). Planetary/chain canon lives in the 30000-35000 range (not in this 1x/2x scope).

### 6. Repository-as-Ground-Truth Principle
Appears in CANON-25000 (Memory Sovereignty), CANON-25100 (transition artifacts → git commit), and CANON-25200 (all platforms synchronize through repository). This is a constitutional invariant, not a preference.

### 7. Six-Chain Triad Structure
The six chains naturally cluster into three complementary pairs: (Intelligence + Information), (Insight + Wisdom), (Expertise + Knowledge). These pairs also form three synthesis triads: Perception-Action, Understanding, Integration. The pairing structure governs constructive interference and specialization track guidance.

### 8. Operational Status Spread
Among the 13 files: 3 are `operational` (CANON-25000, 25100, 25200), 2 are `partial` (CANON-10000, 20000, 25200), and the rest are `theoretical`. This marks the 25000-cluster (memory/platform infrastructure) as the most operationally mature sub-range in the 1x/2x block.
