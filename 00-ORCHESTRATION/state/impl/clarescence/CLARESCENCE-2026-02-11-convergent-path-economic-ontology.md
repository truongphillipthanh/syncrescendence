# CLARESCENCE: Convergent Path — Economic Ontology Architecture

**Date**: 2026-02-11
**Fidelity**: Strategic (Passes 0-10)
**Agent**: Commander (Mac mini, Claude Opus 4.6)
**IntentionLink**: INT-MI19, INT-1612, INT-1201, INT-P014, INT-1202
**Sovereign Mandate**: Full architectural authority delegated. "Extrapolate from our syncrescendent values."

## PHASE 0: UNIFIED GROUND TRUTH

### Stream Convergence

| Stream | Status | Key Finding |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Ontological Metacharacterization | 10-pass clarescence DONE | 7 Decision Atoms, 5 critical gaps, 4-layer kernel architecture proposed |
| Homebrew Audit | 95% | 2 sideloaded dupes to delete (ChatGPT.app, Perplexity.app) |
| Terminal Opacity | DONE | 3-tier continuum configured |
| Skills | DONE (227) | 10/10 core verified |
| Emacs | DORMANT | .md/.org mismatch = architectural dead end |
| MBA Cascade | COMPLETE | 243 formulas, 22 skills, 8 configs |
| Adjudicator x2 | FAILED | gpt-5.3-codex model inaccessible |
| Cartographer | EXHAUSTED | Gemini 429 capacity limit |

### Three Critical Discoveries

1. **Cartographer has produced near-zero value.** 6 tasks dispatched, 395 total lines across ALL results. Narrative Exegesis returned "I am ready to receive the task." — zero work done. Signal-to-noise: 0%.

2. **Kinetic layer data ALREADY EXISTS.** 580+ rows in 5 markdown files (ACTION_TYPES 87, APP_ACTIONS 230, AGENT_BINDINGS 126, MODEL_CAPABILITIES 48, WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES 83).

3. **ontology.db is EMPTY. model_intelligence.db has 86 rows.** The query CLI (13 commands) points at an empty database. MEMORY.md claims "939 rows, 21 tables" — aspiration masquerading as state.

### Economic Reality

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Monthly burn | $160-210 |
| Revenue | $0 |
| INT-1201 status | FAILED |
| Biggest waste | Google AI Pro ($20/month) for Cartographer = zero output |
| Unknown cost | OpenAI API for Graphiti/Mem0 embeddings |

## PASS 1-3: Calibration + Lenses + CANON

**Lens Score: 11/18 PASS, 4 WARN, 3 FAIL** — Below 12/18 threshold. Decision space reframed.

FAIL lenses: Verifiability (empty DB), Delegability (2/5 agents dead), Token Economy (40% agent budget wasted), Agent Compatibility (only Commander reliably operational).

---

## PASS 4-6: Omni-Qualities + Five Faces + Rosetta

- Omniscience DEGRADED (state files lie about DB contents)
- Omnipotence REDUCED (Commander = single point of execution)
- Harmony BROKEN (multiple truth surfaces, stale state, agents offline)
- New Rosetta term: "Economic Subsistence" — a tool/service that generates enough value to justify its cost

---

## PASS 7-9: Backlog + nth-Order + Energy

- Cartographer hibernation saves $20/month and eliminates dead dispatches
- Fleet simplifies to Sovereign + Commander + Ajna (when ready)
- Other agents become on-demand specialists, not always-on
- Total session investment: ~260K tokens, within budget

---

## PASS 10: AUTHENTICITY GATE — PASSED

Not cargo cult Constellation worship. Use what works. "Everything is trade-offs." "Don't disqualify for spottiness." But DO disqualify for zero output.

---

## DECISION ATOMS

### DA-01: Cartographer HIBERNATE
Suspend Cartographer dispatch. Evaluate Google AI Pro cancellation. Reactivate when Gemini CLI produces >100 lines per task.

### DA-02: Adjudicator Status Investigation
Determine if gpt-5.3-codex is permanently revoked or temporarily exhausted. Switch model if revoked.

### DA-03: Emacs Observation Layer HIBERNATE
.md/.org mismatch is architectural dead end. Future observation dashboard = HighCommand web UI.

### DA-04: Hydrate ontology.db (IMMEDIATE)
Load 580+ kinetic rows + 86 model_intelligence rows into ontology.db. Makes ontology_query.py operational.

### DA-05: Correct Stale State (IMMEDIATE)
Fix MEMORY.md, DYN-BACKLOG.md, IMPL-MAP entries that claim false state.

### DA-06: Economic Fleet Configuration
Operational fleet: Sovereign + Commander + Psyche (if confirmed) + Ajna (when ready). Others = on-demand.

### DA-07: Ontology Entity Expansion
Accept 6 new entity types (Commitment, Goal, Risk, Relationship, Resource, Environment). Verb governance: advisory mode. n8n: DEFER.

### DA-08: Revenue Path (SOVEREIGN-GATED)
INT-1201 needs mechanism: consulting ($100-150/hr), skill licensing, architecture advisory. Commander cannot decide alone.

---

## CONVERGENT PATH

Hydrate ontology.db from existing kinetic data, correct stale state, hibernate non-functional agents, consolidate fleet to what works, then drive ontology kernel forward on Commander alone until revenue or agent access restores the constellation.

---

## IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Housekeeping + Hydration (THIS SESSION)
1. Commit uncommitted DYN state
2. Fix stale IMPL-MAP entries (SYN-16 → done)
3. Correct MEMORY.md ontology claims
4. Hydrate ontology.db from kinetic markdown + model_intelligence.db
5. Verify with ontology_query.py stats

### Phase 2: Agent Fleet Right-Sizing (THIS WEEK)
1. Investigate Adjudicator model access
2. Suspend Cartographer dispatch
3. Evaluate Google AI Pro cancellation with Sovereign
4. Update COCKPIT.md agent status

### Phase 3: Ontology Kernel Advancement (NEXT 2 WEEKS)
1. Add 6 new entity types
2. Add governed_verbs and state_machines tables (advisory)
3. Expand ontology_query.py
4. Wire DYN-GLOBAL_LEDGER as event source

### Phase 4: Economic Enablement (SOVEREIGN-GATED)
1. Revenue mechanism decision
2. Ajna production tier
3. n8n deployment

**Confidence**: 90%
**Falsifier**: If Sovereign prioritizes expansion over consolidation, or agent access restores within 24h.

**END STRATEGIC CLARESCENCE**
