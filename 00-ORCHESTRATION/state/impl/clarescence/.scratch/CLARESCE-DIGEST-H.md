## KEY DECISIONS (named decision atoms, architectural choices)

- **Rosetta expansion from 17 to 24 categories**: Gap analysis identifies 7 new categories (18-24) and ~72 new terms. Decision: ratify 9 Tier 1 terms for immediate v2.7.0, absorb Tiers 2-4 progressively.
- **Tri-Helix deprecation hazard**: Entry #16 deprecated "Tri-Helix" as Chain Matrix terminology. The convergence "Tri-Helical Strategy" is a live and entirely different concept (3 synchronized timelines). Resolution declared critical -- false negative risk is high.
- **DOC-B overrides DOC-A on platform timing**: YouTube delayed to Month 33 (not Months 2-4 as in DOC-A); Phase I is TEXT-ONLY through Month 24. DOC-B is the authoritative sequencing reference.
- **Phase 0 is text-only for 24 months**: Visual content, YouTube, Instagram all deferred. Brand Bible development occupies Months 22-30 as a dedicated entrepreneurial transition phase.
- **Open-source replication, not empire**: Ultimate goal explicitly framed as proving viability of one pathway and catalyzing parallel experiments worldwide -- not hierarchical scaling or institutional replacement.
- **Instrumentation is a named three-tier hierarchy**: Tier 1 (Helpers), Tier 2 (Demonstrators / World-Shards), Tier 3 (Nodelets). Currently MISSING from scaffold entirely; needs a new CANON file.
- **Kill criteria are non-negotiable gates**: Thread->RSVP <3% for two weeks, artifact without micro-demo = no release, event underperforms twice = month pause. These are operational kill switches, not aspirational metrics.

## CORE CONCEPTS & TAXONOMY

- **Tri-Helical Strategy**: Three synchronized timelines -- (1) Technological Maturity (external pacing clock), (2) Business Trajectory (Alchemizing Catalyst engine), (3) Personal Trajectory (Embodiment Proof). Each enables the others.
- **Catalyst Packet**: Atomic unit of the Alchemizing Catalyst engine. Four parts: Claim + Micro-demo (30-60s) + Artifact + Invitation (single CTA). Not yet encoded in scaffold.
- **Maturity Gates (A/S/P/T)**: Four normalized 0-5 scales published monthly: A-maturity (Abstraction), S-readiness (Simulation), P-viability (Physical), T-network (Transcendence). Prevent self-deception; currently MISSING.
- **Gaian Field Node**: Physical parcel-scale (1-10 acres) installation integrating Power, Water, Air, Data, Food under intelligent control with telemetry. The telos of the endeavor. Budget $350-900k depending on source document.
- **Way Place**: Earned designation for Field Nodes meeting 7 criteria: operational excellence, educational function, community programming, hospitality, governance maturity, network contribution, ritual integration.
- **World-Shard**: Bounded simulation with stated domain/boundary, typed inputs, outputs with metrics, documented assumptions, error model, residuals, and "good enough" thresholds. Tier 2 Instrumentation; currently MISSING from scaffold.
- **Nodelet**: Sensor+control+logger+enclosure subsystem. Four base types: Power (CT clamps, contactor), Air (PM2.5/CO2/temp, fan relay), Water (rain capture, solenoid, irrigation), Data (uplink failover, WAN ping, health telemetry).
- **Cinematic Textbook Model**: YouTube as 12+ predetermined seasons (96+ episodes with titles and runtimes). Production quality: Planet Earth + Kurzgesagt + 3Blue1Brown + melodysheep. Content brand immutable.
- **Elevated Plainstyle**: Voice spec: cultured, refined, eloquent, witty, warm; no emojis; literary devices for precision; thermodynamic/helical metaphors. Keystone rhetorical principle.
- **Compositional Hierarchy**: Higher capabilities presuppose lower as enabling substrates. Mirrors scientific enablement chain: Symbolic Representation -> Natural Sciences -> Engineering -> Society -> Novel Disciplines.
- **Causal Chain (10 stages)**: CONCEPTUAL ARCHITECTURE -> PERSONAL EMBODIMENT -> EDUCATIONAL VALIDATION -> ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY -> EXPERIENTIAL DIMENSION -> CAPITAL ACCUMULATION -> PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE -> DEMONSTRATION VIABILITY -> NETWORK REPLICATION -> CIVILIZATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE.
- **Business Dependency Chain**: ARCHITECTURE -> EMBODIMENT -> EDUCATION -> BUSINESS -> EVENTS -> NODES -> WAY PLACES. Each arrow is irreversible.
- **Voluntary Coordination**: Third coordination mechanism (beyond coercion and market exchange). Participation through demonstrated value. The governance model for the Field Node Network.
- **Content-Native Sustainability**: Economic model where intelligence multiplication enables scaling without fixed labor cost. Revenue serves next-phase enablement.
- **Five Phases (DOC-B)**: I (Months 1-24, Computational/Text), Transition (22-30, Brand Identity), II (31-54, Visual/YouTube), III (55-90, Engineering/IBEW), IV (91-126, Field Node), V (127+, Network Replication).

## GAPS IDENTIFIED

- **Instrumentation Architecture (Domain 8): MISSING** -- No CANON file. Entire 3-tier hierarchy (Helpers/Demonstrators/Nodelets), World-Shard spec format, nodelet BOM/SOP requirements.
- **World-Shards (Domain 9): MISSING** -- The bounded simulation construct and its 6-element spec have no structural home in scaffold.
- **Kill Criteria & Anti-Patterns (Domain 22): MISSING** -- A/S/P/T maturity gates, conversion thresholds, 5 named anti-patterns not encoded anywhere. Operationally critical.
- **Network Replication (Domain 27): MISSING** -- Open-source replication model, decentralized governance, mutual support protocols, success criteria absent from scaffold.
- **Rosetta vocabulary gap: 61.3% of 119 convergence terms absent** -- Rosetta v2.6.0 is scaffold-internal (agent orchestration, corpus management). Convergence vocabulary is outward-facing (content strategy, physical infrastructure, community, economics, philosophy). These domains are complementary, not overlapping.
- **Content Brand Architecture (Domain 6): PARTIAL** -- 12-season structure with 88+ predetermined episode titles, Brand Bible as 100-150 page deliverable, Phase 0 text-only constraint all unencoded.
- **Live Events (Domain 14): PARTIAL** -- 4 event formats (Proof Session/Quarterly Gathering/Annual Convergence/Special Intensive), run-of-show 7-part template, consent framework absent.
- **DOC-A vs DOC-B divergence unresolved** -- Live Events timing gap: DOC-A says Month 6-9, DOC-B says Month 114. A 9-year divergence on the same concept. No reconciliation exists in scaffold.
- **Tri-Helix false negative in Rosetta** -- Entry #16 deprecates the term; searchers will hit "DEPRECATED" and miss the active Tri-Helical Strategy concept. Dangerous navigation failure.
- **Philosophical vocabulary entirely absent from Rosetta** -- Consciousness Investigating Itself, Recursive Amplification, Gaialogical Principles, Voluntary Coordination, Distributed Resilience, Integrative Interregnum, Post-Labor Economics all missing. Rosetta has only #185 Sovereignty as philosophical entry.
- **Economic vocabulary missing** -- Risk Removed/Time Returned, Content-Native Sustainability, Surplus Accumulation, 6-tier pricing structure, unit economics, sensitivity scenarios all absent.
- **Community/Events vocabulary missing** -- Steward, Proof Session, Quarterly Gathering, Annual Convergence, Peer Coils, Run-of-Show, Adoption Rate, Consent Framework all absent.

## THEMES

- **Irreducible sequencing as philosophy**: The entire convergence architecture is built on the premise that causal dependencies cannot be violated. "No phase rushed. No dependency skipped." This is both operational guidance and ethical commitment.
- **Embodiment as credential**: Cannot teach what hasn't been embodied. Personal Trajectory (Timeline 3) is not personal ambition but structural prerequisite for educational credibility. IBEW apprenticeship is an architectural necessity.
- **Measurement as anti-self-deception**: Kill criteria, maturity gates, evidence ledgers, conversion metrics -- all exist to prevent narrative drift. The system is explicitly engineered against the "story, not a step" failure mode.
- **Complementary not competing domains**: The Rosetta Stone captures scaffold-internal operations; convergence vocabulary captures outward vision. Both are necessary; neither can substitute for the other.
- **Technological pacing as external clock**: The Abstraction Phase is at ~85% maturity with a 12-24 month window before commoditization. This urgency is structural to all sequencing decisions.
- **Demonstration not prescription**: The goal is not to solve civilization's problems but to prove one viable pathway -- catalyzing thousands of parallel experiments. The Demonstration Principle is a load-bearing philosophical constraint.
- **Open-source as strategic and ethical choice**: Replication playbook is freely available by design. Distributed ownership, decentralized coordination, and voluntary cooperation are the governance model.

## PER-FILE HIGH-VALUE EXTRACTS

### CONVERGENCE-INTENT-TAXONOMY (1,836 lines)

- **28 domains extracted** from two source documents (DOC-A: 2726 lines thematic; DOC-B: 2229 lines chronological). DOC-B is the authoritative sequencing reference; DOC-A has more aggressive early timelines (Proof Session Month 6-9 vs DOC-B Month 114).
- **Scaffold capture summary**: 8 domains CAPTURED (29%), 16 PARTIAL (57%), 4 MISSING (14%). CAPTURED domains: Philosophical Foundations, Tri-Helix, Platform Architecture, Rhetorical Calibration, Four-Stage Curriculum, Compositional Hierarchy, Economic Model, Civilizational Context.
- **MISSING domains are load-bearing**: Instrumentation Architecture, World-Shards, Kill Criteria/Anti-Patterns, Network Replication are not optional elaborations -- they are structural pillars with no CANON representation.
- **~180 Rosetta Stone term candidates** identified and grouped across 12 categories (CANON Cosmology, Architecture/Strategy, Operations, Platform Roles, Instrumentation, Educational, Physical Infrastructure, Economic, Governance/Community, Documentation, Risk/Safety, Philosophical/Civilizational).
- **Platform catalog of 18 platforms** with roles, cadences, and phase timing specified. Key roles: YouTube (central cinematic textbook), X/Twitter (only adhoc platform), Facebook (only personal journey), TikTok (memetic infiltration, explicitly delayed to Month 70-75).
- **12-season YouTube structure fully specified**: 96+ episodes spanning Months 33-162+, covering Ontological Dimensions through Civilizational Implications. Season structure is predetermined, not reactive.
- **Revenue projections by phase**: Phase I target $4-6k/mo by Month 24, Phase II $15-20k/mo by Month 54, Phase III $120-150k/yr by Month 102, Phase IV $180-250k/yr by Month 126, Phase V $250k+/yr. Field Node capital accumulation target: $300-475k cumulative over 3 years.
- **DOC-A vs DOC-B cross-document divergence table** provided for 14 dimensions. The taxonomy preserves both sets of timelines without forcing reconciliation -- a deferred architectural decision.

### ROSETTA-CONVERGENCE-GAP-ANALYSIS (383 lines)

- **119 terms cataloged across 14 categories** (A-N). 27 PRESENT (22.7%), 19 PARTIAL (16%), 73 MISSING (61.3%). The gap is not a deficiency in Rosetta -- it reflects domain orthogonality. Rosetta serves scaffold-internal operations; convergence vocabulary is outward-facing.
- **9 Tier 1 critical entries proposed** (entries 242-250): Tri-Helical Strategy, Gaian Field Node, Way Place, Catalyst Packet, Five Phases, Compositional Hierarchy, Causal Dependencies, Consciousness Investigating Itself, World-Shard. These unlock the entire convergence vocabulary for Rosetta reference.
- **7 new Rosetta categories proposed** (18-24): Convergence Architecture (~20 terms), Content Strategy (~10), Convergence Philosophy (~10), Education Architecture (~8), Community Architecture (~10), Convergence Economics (~8), Convergence Anti-Patterns (~6). Total proposed additions: ~72 terms, bringing Rosetta from 241 to ~313 entries.
- **Tri-Helix confusion risk is the most urgent fix**: #16 deprecated in Rosetta without forward reference to the live Tri-Helical Strategy concept. A reader searching for convergence strategy hits a dead end.
- **5 named anti-patterns fully defined**: "Cohorts before Patreon," "Platform sprawl" (3 channels excellent before a 4th exists), "Architectural churn" (renaming primitives faster than teaching them), "Unlogged claims" (any claim without micro-demo is a story), "Scope creep at Malibu" (pick one slice, publish, prove judgment).

## WHAT THIS BATCH CONTRIBUTES TO THE WHOLE

The Convergence Intent Taxonomy is the master structural map of the entire outward-facing Syncrescendence vision -- 28 domains, ~180 term candidates, explicit scaffold gap assessments, and a cross-document divergence analysis that preserves DOC-A and DOC-B without premature reconciliation. The Rosetta Gap Analysis is the precision instrument that reveals exactly what vocabulary is missing from the shared lexicon, with priority tiers and draft definitions ready for ratification. Together, these two documents establish both the terrain (what the convergence vision contains) and the translation layer gap (what the Rosetta Stone cannot yet reference) -- making them the prerequisite inputs for any agent tasked with scaffold expansion, Rosetta versioning, or CANON file creation for the four missing domains.
