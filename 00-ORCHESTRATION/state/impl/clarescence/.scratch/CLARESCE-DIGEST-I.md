## KEY DECISIONS (named decision atoms, architectural choices)

- **Product-Facing Scaffold Injection**: The scaffold's internal coordination layer is declared mature; next phase is explicitly "product-facing scaffold injection" — convergence vision content must now be loaded into scaffold with same operational rigor as agent orchestration.
- **Critical Triangle Named**: Three domains identified as mutually blocking minimal viable system: Alchemizing Catalyst + Content Brand Architecture + Economic Model. All three at CRITICAL / <=10% coverage. Without them, constellation coordinates itself but produces nothing that sustains the endeavor.
- **P0 Injection Targets (5)**: Economic Model, Alchemizing Catalyst, Content Brand Architecture, Tri-Helical Synchronization, Curriculum Architecture — these are the gate-all-downstream-work files to create.
- **Tri-Helix Deprecation Trap**: Rosetta Stone #16 deprecated "Tri-Helix" as a Chain Matrix concept, but convergence Tri-Helical Strategy (three synchronized timelines) is entirely different. The deprecation masks a live strategic concept — this must be explicitly resolved.
- **Research Pipeline Tool Selection**: Hybrid path chosen — NotebookLM Enterprise API for notebook creation/source management (stable, official Pre-GA), notebooklm-py for querying/chat (unofficial but uniquely capable; official API has NO chat endpoint). Claude 200K context as fallback when API query is blocked.
- **Auto-Classification as P0**: The 3-tier classification algorithm (author match → keyword match → LLM fallback at ~$0.001/file) is the first thing to build; everything downstream depends on it. taxonomy.json must exist before the classifier.
- **Hazel as MBA Trigger**: Hazel is the recommended watch trigger on MBA for new `.md` research files (not launchd fswatch), because it provides immediate visual feedback and is already in the Sovereign's ecosystem.
- **14-Notebook Taxonomy Locked**: The taxonomy is declared stable and is the foundation for all downstream automation. Cross-notebook resonance is explicitly flagged as a gap requiring future tooling (IMPL-P-0016).

## CORE CONCEPTS & FRAMEWORKS

- **Alchemizing Catalyst**: The bootstrapping engine converting doctrine into attentional value. Fundamental unit = Catalyst Packet (Claim + Micro-demo + Artifact + Invitation). Four definitional formulations: catalytic transmutation, bootstrapping engine, systematic transformation, thermodynamic converter.
- **Tri-Helical Strategy**: Three synchronized timelines that must be tracked simultaneously: (1) Technological Maturity (external pacing clock: Abstraction 85%, Simulation 40%, Physical 15%, Transcendence 5%); (2) Business Trajectory (Architecture → Embodiment → Education → Business → Events → Nodes → Way Places); (3) Personal Trajectory (6-year skill development). Synchronization gates define where one timeline blocks another.
- **Three-Rail Operating System**: Rail A (Editorial) — transforms ideas into 1-minute demonstrations; Rail B (Instrumentation) — tools/simulations/telemetry making claims measurable; Rail C (Stewardship) — cultivates people and sites able to run demonstrations safely. Station-and-gate model: "no bundle, no advance."
- **Instrumentation Hierarchy (3 tiers)**: Tier 1 Helpers (internal acceleration, document compilers, clip slicers); Tier 2 Demonstrators (world-shards: calculators, room energy balance, rainfall capture); Tier 3 Nodelets (hardware: Power/Air/Water/Data nodelets with sensor + control + logging + safe enclosure).
- **Maturity Gates (A/S/P/T)**: 4 normalized scales 0–5 for Abstraction/Simulation/Physical/Transcendence, published monthly. A kill criterion: two consecutive weeks below 3% thread→RSVP → pause new channels.
- **Elevated Plainstyle**: Public voice specification — "cultured, refined, eloquent, witty, warm — eschewing emojis or stark antitheses." Platform-specific register variations: X crystals vs. Medium syntheses vs. Newsletter intimate dialogues.
- **11-Step Research Pipeline**: CAPTURE → ACCUMULATE → CATEGORIZE → PARTITION → UPLOAD → QUESTION → SYNTHESIZE → EXTRACT → INJECT → ARCHIVE → APPEND. Yellow steps require Sovereign; Blue is NotebookLM; Green is the feedback loop.
- **Syncrescendence Question Protocol (6 qualities)**: SYNCRESCENDENT (connect to civilizational transition), PRESCIENT (anticipate direction), WISE (durable structural insight), ILLUMINATING (cross-source patterns), SAPIENT (embody judgment), CONVERGENT (link to specific objectives).
- **Exocortex Layer Model**: Sensorium, Ontology of Self, Agency, Sovereignty, Reflexive Intelligence — the 5-layer cognitive prosthesis framework unifying Constellation + SaaS + Ontology + Sovereignty.
- **Way Place Designation**: 7 criteria (operational excellence, educational function, community programming, hospitality, governance maturity, network contribution, ritual integration). Network emergence: Years 5–7 (2–3 nodes), 7–10 (5–10 nodes, 2–3 Way Places), 10–15 (10–20 nodes, 5–8 Way Places), 15–20 (50+ nodes).

## GAPS / COVERAGE FINDINGS

- **12% overall scaffold coverage of convergence vision** (weighted average across 21 domains).
- **3 domains at 0%**: Live Events (4 formats: Proof Sessions, Quarterly Gatherings, Annual Convergences, Special Intensives), Compliance/Safety/Ethics (electrical, plumbing, structural, environmental, zoning, insurance, liability), Brand Identity/Visual Design (Brand Bible, cinematic style guide, production pipeline).
- **7 domains at 1–5% (terminology only)**: Curriculum, Economic Model, Instrumentation, Field Nodes, Community Governance, Personal Trajectory, Phased Operational Timeline.
- **Platform Architecture is the only substantially covered domain (65%)** — SaaS integration architecture, stack teleology, IIC configs — but missing deployment sequencing, content-platform specs, hand-off rules, audience migration strategy, kill criteria.
- **Economic Model entirely missing from scaffold**: 6 pricing tiers (FREE through WAY PLACE), financial projections (Conservative Y1 $35k → Y3 $250k; Baseline Y1 $50k → Y3 $400k; Optimistic Y1 $75k → Y3 $600k), unit economics, capital accumulation strategy ($300k–475k over 3 years for Field Node investment).
- **4-Stage Curriculum not operationalized**: Stage I Abstraction (85% maturity), Stage II Simulation (40%), Stage III Physical (15%), Stage IV Transcendence (5%) — none have learning objectives, entry/exit criteria, assessment rubrics, or prerequisite chains in scaffold.
- **6-year personal skill development timeline entirely absent**: IBEW electrical apprenticeship (Year 1), HVAC/IT networking (Years 2–3), robotics/mechatronics (Year 4), journey-level electrical/Field Node construction (Year 5), network transcendence (Year 6+).
- **Research corpus (267 files, 38 days) was entirely unprocessed before 2026-02-16** — no notebooks created, no classification run, no insights injected.
- **Cross-notebook resonance is a known gap**: NotebookLM cannot query across notebooks; IMPL-P-0016 (cross-notebook resonance detector) is the mitigation, not yet built.
- **Rosetta Stone injection gap**: 73 of 119 convergence terms (61%) absent from v2.6.0. Now partially closed by v2.7.0 (Cats 18–24 added), but Ontology Bridge still at 183 entities from v2.5.0.

## THEMES

- **Internal/External Asymmetry**: The scaffold is world-class at internal AI coordination and near-zero at external-facing product specifications. This is architecturally correct (build factory before product) but is now the primary constraint.
- **Terminology Before Operations**: Multiple domains have concepts named and typed in Rosetta/Ontology Bridge but zero operational mechanics. Naming is not operationalization.
- **The Embodiment Mandate**: "Cannot teach what hasn't been embodied" appears as a gate across curriculum, personal trajectory, and content strategy. The 6-year skill development timeline is the operational expression of this philosophical commitment.
- **Research as Intelligence Cycle**: The research pipeline is not archival — it is an intelligence loop feeding the scaffold. The 267-file corpus represents a frozen intelligence asset until the pipeline runs.
- **Automation Realism**: The pipeline spec explicitly marks which steps require irreplaceable human judgment (Sovereign curation = irreplaceable; extraction of "unequivocally superior" insights = judgment-heavy, needs human validation). Automation targets are format conversion and routing, not selection and judgment.
- **Staged Deployment Discipline**: "Three channels excellent before a fourth exists." Phase 0 = text-only (no visual platforms Months 1–24). Business timeline has explicit sequencing: Architecture → Embodiment → Education → Business → Events → Nodes → Way Places. Anti-pattern explicitly named: Cohorts before Patreon, Patreon before demos, demos before instruments, instruments before vocabulary.

## PER-FILE HIGH-VALUE EXTRACTS

### SCAFFOLD-CONVERGENCE-COVERAGE-AUDIT

- **21 domains audited** against two convergence documents (DOC-A: syncrescendence_convergence.md 2726 lines; DOC-B: syncrescendent_convergence_aligned.md 2229 lines). Weighted average coverage: 12%.
- **Coverage distribution**: 3 domains at vacuum (0%), 7 at terminology-only (1–5%), 8 at concept-defined-nothing-operational (6–15%), 1 at partial-operational (20%), 1 substantially-captured (65%), none fully operational.
- **5 CRITICAL gaps** (Content Strategy, Curriculum, Economic Model, Tri-Helical Strategy, Alchemizing Catalyst) are the minimum viable product specification for the scaffold's next phase.
- **8 HIGH severity gaps** (Instrumentation, Community Governance, Compliance, Risk Frameworks, Personal Trajectory, Three-Rail OS, Content Distribution Pipeline, Phased Timeline) require addressing in next sprint after P0.
- **Injection priority roadmap is fully specified**: 13 proposed new files (with paths) for P0/P1, 7 more for P2 backlog. All proposed paths are in `02-ENGINE/` or `00-ORCHESTRATION/state/`.
- **Verification methodology documented**: All percentages verified through direct file reads, directory listings, grep searches, and full reads of both convergence documents — not estimates.

### RESEARCH-PIPELINE-AUTOMATION-SPEC

- **11-step pipeline** with clear actor assignment per step (Sovereign-required steps: 1 CAPTURE, 5 UPLOAD, 7 SYNTHESIZE; automation candidates for rest).
- **Automation priority matrix**: Steps 3 CATEGORIZE, 4 PARTITION, 5 UPLOAD are P0. Steps 2 ACCUMULATE threshold alerting, 6 QUESTION generation, 7 SYNTHESIZE, 8 EXTRACT, 10 ARCHIVE, 11 APPEND are P1. Steps 9 INJECT and full orchestrator are P2.
- **NotebookLM Enterprise API status**: Pre-GA as of 2026-02-16. Supports notebook CRUD and source management but NO chat/query endpoint. notebooklm-py v0.3.2 (460 commits, active) fills the gap with `ask` command via undocumented API.
- **20 backlog items created** (IMPL-P-0001 through IMPL-P-0020) with implementation sequence: Phase 0 (taxonomy.json → classify → partition → evaluate API → upload script), Phase 1 (Hazel rule, question skill, threshold alert, tracking ledger), Phase 2 (archive, append, insight extraction).
- **Risk register (6 risks)**: NotebookLM Enterprise access denied (HIGH impact, MEDIUM likelihood), notebooklm-py API break (MEDIUM impact, HIGH likelihood), cross-notebook resonance loss (HIGH impact, MEDIUM likelihood) are the top concerns.
- **Corpus state at spec creation**: 267 files, 7.2 files/day average, peak 32/day on 2026-02-05, accumulated over 37 days without processing.

### RESEARCH-CORPUS-CHUNKING-TAXONOMY

- **14 notebooks, 255 assigned files** (12 cross-domain files assigned to primary cluster). Date range 2026-01-08 to 2026-02-14. ~150+ unique authors.
- **Four VERY HIGH signal notebooks**: NB04 Agentic Note-Taking (11 files, @arscontexta + @molt_cornelius), NB07 Economic Reckoning (27 files, SaaS disruption + barbell economy), NB11 Deep Research (10 files, 5 constellation research PROMPT+RESPONSE pairs — strategic intelligence tier).
- **Five cross-notebook resonance clusters explicitly identified**: Memory + Note-Taking (NB3+4 = complete exocortex corpus), Security + Infrastructure (NB2+12), Economic + Vibe Coding (NB7+8, Sarah Guo's "judgment engineering" bridges both), Claude Code + Multi-Agent (NB5+6), Deep Research as strategic index for all others.
- **Key findings by theme**: OpenClaw evolved through 3 names (trademark pressure); Moltbook's viral hack = auto-install HEARTBEAT.md; "butler metaphor" = brilliant but leaves door open; Three-layer memory (entity graph + daily notes + tacit) is emerging consensus; Observational memory achieves 94.87% LongMemEval without vector DB; $285B SaaS market cap wiped in one day after Cowork launch; 100-engineer companies doing $100M+ ARR via parallelized intent.
- **Recommended upload order**: NB04 (densest novel thinking) → NB03 (memory engineering) → NB07 (macro strategic) → NB11 (constellation intelligence) → remaining in descending signal strength.
- **NB01 (32 files) approaches NotebookLM's 50-source consumer limit** — notebook split protocol needed before further accumulation.

## WHAT THIS BATCH CONTRIBUTES TO THE WHOLE

These three documents together constitute the operational infrastructure specification for the scaffold's transition from factory-mode to product-mode: the coverage audit defines exactly what must be built and in what order; the pipeline spec defines how external intelligence enters the scaffold and becomes crystallized knowledge; the chunking taxonomy is the map of the first major intelligence asset (267 research files) waiting to be processed. Collectively they move the clarescence trajectory from diagnosis (what is missing?) toward prescription (here is the build order, here are the backlog items, here are the files to create) — the next synthesis agent should treat the injection priority roadmap from the coverage audit as the primary work queue, and the pipeline backlog items as the prerequisite infrastructure to execute it at scale.
