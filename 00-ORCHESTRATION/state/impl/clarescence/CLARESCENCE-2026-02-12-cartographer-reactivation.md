# CLARESCENCE: Cartographer Reactivation & Corpus Survey Readiness
Date: 2026-02-12
Fidelity: tactical
Passes run: 0+1-3

## Convergent Path
Reactivate Cartographer agent immediately and execute the ORIENT -> SITUATE -> CALIBRATE -> TRIAGE loop, starting with the `MODEL-INDEX` refresh task.

## Rationale
- **Strategic Alignment**: Directly supports INT-1612 (Automations) and INT-1209 (Temporal Intelligence Refresh).
- **Operational Need**: The constellation currently lacks high-fidelity sensing since DA-01 (hibernation).
- **Efficacy Proof**: Reactivation provides the opportunity to meet the ">100 lines/task" performance threshold set by the Sovereign.
- **Ready Substrate**: Inbox already contains `TASK-MODEL-INDEX-REFRESH.md` which is a P1 sensing task.

## Dependencies created/updated
- **Updates**: `COCKPIT.md` (remove hibernation note), `AGENTS.md` (update status).
- **Unblocks**: All future corpus exegesis and landscape survey tasks.

## Falsifier
If Gemini CLI output remains low-signal or fails to provide the required volume/fidelity, the CIO role should return to hibernation or be reassigned.

## Confidence
High (95%)

## Energy cost
Estimated 100K-200K tokens for full orientation and initial task execution.
