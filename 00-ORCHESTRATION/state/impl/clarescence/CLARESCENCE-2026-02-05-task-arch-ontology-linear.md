# CLARESCENCE: Task Architecture Operationalization + Ontology Foundation + Linear Onboarding

**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Fidelity**: full
**Passes run**: 1-10
**Owner**: Commander (Claude Code Opus)

## Convergent Path (single recommendation)

Execute a **three-wave sequential deployment**: (1) Commit the 150 dirty changes to establish a clean baseline, then (2) populate Linear as the T1a operational layer with projects mapped from DYN-BACKLOG.md and issues from IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md, then (3) continue PROJ-006a (Ontology Phase 1) by extending CANON frontmatter from the 10-file pilot to all 79 files — delegating the mechanical application to Adjudicator while Commander expands the Ontology Bridge relations. The five-tier task architecture (T0-T3) is already formalized in ARCH-TASK_TIER_ARCHITECTURE.md; Linear onboarding makes T1a operational. ClickUp (T1b) is deferred to Sovereign as it requires non-repo life context. The Ontology is the keystone that transforms static Canon into queryable knowledge graph — it must advance substrate-agnostically while SOVEREIGN-009 remains pending.

## Digest Rationale (easy to digest)
- **150 dirty changes = entropy accumulator**: Every session adds drift. Commit now or compound debt.
- **Linear makes T1a real**: The five-tier model is documented but T1a (Linear) is empty. Populating it converts architecture from theory to operational.
- **Ontology Phase 1 is unblocked and highest-leverage**: 10/79 CANON files have extended frontmatter. Completing all 79 enables Dataview queries — the MVP "Palantir" per INT-MI19. This is substrate-agnostic and independent of SOVEREIGN-009.
- **Adjudicator delegation for frontmatter**: 69 remaining CANON files need mechanical frontmatter application. This is ideal Adjudicator work (mechanical, parallelizable, low-judgment).
- **ClickUp deferred correctly**: T1b (non-repo work) requires Sovereign context (interview schedules, home tasks, financial info) that Commander cannot populate.
- **Decision atoms remain provisional**: 5 atoms from SOVEREIGN-009 need Sovereign ratification. Commander cannot unilaterally ratify.
- **Constellation activation gated by API keys**: Adjudicator (Codex CLI) and Cartographer (Gemini CLI) need API key setup — Sovereign action required.

## Falsifier

This path is wrong if: (1) The Sovereign has already decided on a substrate for PROJ-006 (making Phase 1/Phase 2 split unnecessary), (2) Linear proves unsuitable as T1a (e.g., API limitations, cost concerns, or Sovereign prefers a different PM tool), (3) The 150 dirty changes contain conflicting modifications from concurrent OpenClaw agents that require manual resolution rather than bulk commit, or (4) The Ontology Bridge expansion reveals that the 10 entity types in REF-ONTOLOGY_REGISTRY.md are insufficient and the type system needs redesign before frontmatter can be extended.

## Dependencies / Tasks touched
- PROJ-006a: Status 5% → targeting 25% (all 79 CANON files with frontmatter + Dataview queries seeded)
- PROJ-LINEAR: Status NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS (Linear workspace populated with projects + issues)
- IMPL-A-0012: Status new → in_progress (Linear as source of truth design)
- IMPL-A-0001 through IMPL-A-0011: Created as Linear issues for tracking
- IMPL-A-0014: Partially addressed (Linear API direct access established; MCP server still pending)
- DYN-BACKLOG.md: PROJ-LINEAR status update
- DYN-GLOBAL_LEDGER.md: DECISION event for this Clarescence

## Pass notes (keep tight)

### Pass 1 — Triumvirate
- **Destination**: Operational ontology (INT-MI19 "Palantir-like"), functional T1a project management (PROJ-LINEAR), clean working tree
- **Current state**: Five-tier architecture formalized but T1a empty. 10/79 CANON files frontmattered. 150 uncommitted changes. Linear API connected but workspace unpopulated. SOVEREIGN-009 pending (5 disposition decisions blocking PROJ-006b substrate choice).
- **Fit verdict**: HIGH FIT. The three-wave approach addresses the exact "machine is built, isn't running" diagnosis from the Feb 5 Clarescence. Each wave is independently valuable and sequentially de-risks.

### Pass 2 — 18+ Lenses
- **Passes** (14/18): Parsimony (minimal new tooling), Sovereignty (repo remains truth), Portability (Linear is exportable), Determinism (frontmatter schema is mechanical), Reversibility (Linear data can be re-exported), Falsifiability (clear metrics), Translation (Linear readable by Sovereign), Receipts (commits = evidence), Context Economy (frontmatter enables machine queries), Delegation (Adjudicator for mechanical work), Compression (168 Rosetta terms → 10 entity types), Convergence (three waves toward single target), Coherence (aligns with ARCH-TASK_TIER_ARCHITECTURE.md), Sustainability (no new subscriptions beyond existing Linear)
- **Fails** (3/18): Completeness (ClickUp deferred), Velocity (API key dependencies for Adjudicator/Cartographer), Automation (Linear↔repo sync not yet automated)
- **Score**: 14/18 — PASS

### Pass 3 — CANON coherence
- **Canon says**: CANON-00016 defines 14 meaning dimensions and 15 information streams for ontological framework. CANON-00000 SCHEMA governs all. CANON-25200 Constellation Architecture specifies 10 agents across 3 accounts.
- **Drift**: The Canon's ontological framework (CANON-00016) is purely theoretical. The Rosetta Ontology Bridge (v0.1.0) is the only operational substrate. Extended frontmatter on 10 files is the only machine-readable Canon metadata. Gap: 69 CANON files have no extended frontmatter. The `operational_status` field makes the gap visible and queryable — this IS the Ontology's first output.

### Pass 4 — Omni-Qualities
- **Omniscience**: +2. Frontmatter makes Canon machine-queryable. Linear makes project state visible. Dataview queries = "what does the system know about itself?"
- **Omnipresence**: +1. Linear accessible from any device. Frontmatter accessible from Obsidian on any sync'd device.
- **Omnipotence**: +1. Linear API enables programmatic task management. Dataview enables programmatic Canon queries.
- **Omnibenevolence**: 0. No direct impact on external benefit (this is infrastructure work).

### Pass 5 — Five Faces
- **Sensing**: Frontmatter + Dataview = the system can sense its own Canon state. Linear = the system can sense its project state.
- **Meaning**: Ontology Bridge converts raw terms into typed, related entities. This IS meaning-making infrastructure.
- **Intention**: T0 Intention Compass feeds T1a Linear projects. The pipeline from vision to execution is formalized.
- **Embodiment**: Linear is the first external embodiment of the task architecture. Frontmatter is the first machine-readable embodiment of Canon structure.
- **Harmony**: Three-wave approach balances debt clearance (hygiene), operationalization (capability), and content work (substance). No single dimension is over-indexed.

### Pass 6 — Rosetta
- **Term alignment**: "T1a" = Linear (repo work), "T1b" = ClickUp (life work) — new terms, need Rosetta entry. "Frontmatter schema" = YAML metadata in CANON files — aligns with existing Obsidian conventions. "Operational status" = {theoretical, partial, operational} — new enum, needs Rosetta entry.
- **Drift risk**: "Ontology" is used loosely across Canon. The Rosetta Bridge gives it precision. Propose Rosetta additions: T1a (#170), T1b (#171), operational_status (#172), CANON frontmatter schema (#173).

### Pass 7 — Backlog coherence
- **Unblocks**: PROJ-006a advances from 5% → 25%. PROJ-LINEAR moves from NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS. IMPL-A-0012 becomes actionable. All 15 IMPL items become trackable in Linear.
- **Creates**: Need for Linear↔DYN-BACKLOG.md sync mechanism (manual for now, MCP server later per IMPL-A-0014). Need for Adjudicator dispatch task for remaining 69 CANON frontmatter files. Need for Rosetta Stone update (4 new terms).
- **Priority**: P0 (commit debt), P1 (Linear + Ontology), P2 (sync automation, Rosetta update)

### Pass 8 — nth-order
- **What breaks**: Nothing. Linear is additive. Frontmatter is additive. Commits resolve rather than create drift.
- **What compounds**: Linear populated → enables MCP server connection later → enables bidirectional sync → enables automated project tracking. Frontmatter on all 79 files → enables Dataview queries → enables dependency analysis → enables automated coherence checking → enables "Palantir" dashboard.
- **New dependencies**: Linear API key must persist (store securely). Adjudicator needs Codex CLI API key for delegation. ClickUp requires Sovereign to populate T1b.

### Pass 9 — Energy state
- **Wave 1 (commit)**: Low energy, high value. Mechanical. Do now.
- **Wave 2 (Linear)**: Medium energy. API calls are mechanical but project/issue mapping requires judgment. Do now — Commander has full context.
- **Wave 3 (Ontology expansion)**: High energy for Bridge expansion (200+ relations), low energy for mechanical frontmatter (delegate). Split: Commander does Bridge, Adjudicator does frontmatter.
- **Sustainability**: Yes. Each wave produces a durable artifact. No maintenance burden created.

### Pass 10 — Authenticity
- **Sovereignty preserved**: Repo remains ground truth (Invariant 5). Linear is cache. DYN-BACKLOG.md continues as repo snapshot.
- **Optionality preserved**: Linear is exportable. Frontmatter is standard YAML. Dataview is open-source Obsidian plugin. No vendor lock-in.
- **Sovereign-at-peak-clarity approval**: The Sovereign explicitly requested this exact sequence: "conduct a /claresce to determine the correct paths forward. Can you commandeer our Linear account and begin filling out the tasks once you've attained clarescence?" This path directly executes the Sovereign's stated intent.
