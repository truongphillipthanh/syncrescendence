# SURGICAL PLAN — ARCH-GRAND_ANNEALMENT.md: Unified Culmination
## Issued: 2026-02-17 | Fingerprint: ed83e2b

---

### Objective

Produce `ARCH-GRAND_ANNEALMENT.md` — the single unified document that culminates all knowledge
accumulated across this session: running logs, clarescences, canon digests, patches, and the
ontology annealment. This is the terminal synthesis of the entire corpus-to-date.

### What Gets Unified

| Layer | Source | Lines | Role |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| Ontological | ARCH-ONTOLOGY_ANNEALMENT_v2.md | 787 | Foundation — canon + metachar + scaffold already baked in |
| Reflective | CLARESCE-MASTER-DIGEST.md | 356 | 66 clarescence files → decisions, seared lessons, constructs |
| Operational | RUNLOGS-MASTER-DIGEST.md | 236 | Running logs → painful lessons, agent grades, failure forensics |
| Corrective | ANNEAL-V2-PATCHES.md | 246 | 8 patches applied to v2 — what was wrong, what was fixed |
| **Total input** | | **1,625** | **Within 3K-line Sonnet budget** |

### What v2 Already Contains (Do Not Re-derive)
- Canon taxonomy (chains, hierarchies, numbering schema)
- Palantir-inspired ontology (Semantic + Kinetic + Dynamic layers)
- Scaffold state (five-tier, constellation agents, memory, automation)
- Strategic convergence (Tri-Helical Strategy, Alchemizing Catalyst, modal timeline)
- Basic clarescence synthesis (§6 of v2 — themes, tensions, gaps)
- Gap analysis (§7 of v2)
- Delta from v1 (§8 of v2)

### What the Grand Annealment Adds (New Layers)

1. **Operational Reality** — from runlogs: the ground truth of what actually happened vs. what was
   planned. Agent reliability grades from evidence. Failure forensics. Infrastructure state at close.

2. **Painful Lessons as First-Class Ontological Content** — the 18 seared lessons from Commander
   sessions are not footnotes; they are the operational invariants that govern how the system runs.
   They belong in the canonical record with the same weight as architectural decisions.

3. **Full Clarescence Depth** — v2's §6 was a thin slice; the clarescence master has 7 sections
   covering: architectural evolution arc, all DEC-* decisions, seared lessons, core constructs,
   convergence state, persistent gaps, and key file index. This deserves full treatment.

4. **Grand Synthesis Section** — a section that only this document can provide: the meta-level
   synthesis. What does it all mean together? What is the coherent picture of the system, the
   person running it, and where it is pointed? What has been proven vs. what remains aspirational?

### Output

- **File**: `00-ORCHESTRATION/state/ARCH-GRAND_ANNEALMENT.md`
- **Ceiling**: 800 lines
- **Commit**: `feat(anneal): grand annealment — unified culmination of logs + clarescences + canon + patches + ontology`

### Assigned To

Single Sonnet synthesis agent — all inputs within 3K-line budget, no parallel lanes needed.

### Proposed Structure

```
## 1. Ontological Core [from v2 §1 — condensed]
## 2. Canon Taxonomy [from v2 §2 — condensed]
## 3. Architecture: Personal Palantir + Sovereign Stack [from v2 §3 + patches]
## 4. Scaffold State [from v2 §4 + clarescence master §4]
## 5. Strategic Convergence [from v2 §5 + clarescence master §5]
## 6. Clarescence Synthesis [from v2 §6 + clarescence master §1-3]
## 7. Operational Reality [NEW — from runlogs master §1-6]
## 8. Seared Lessons Register [NEW — from runlogs §2 + clarescence §3, unified]
## 9. Failure Forensics [NEW — from runlogs §4]
## 10. Persistent Gaps & Open Commitments [from v2 §7 + clarescence §6]
## 11. Agent Reliability Dossier [NEW — from runlogs §8]
## 12. Grand Synthesis [NEW — meta-level synthesis, what it all means]
## 13. Delta from v2 [what this document adds beyond v2]
## Appendix: Key File Paths
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All 4 source documents read by synthesis agent
- [ ] New sections 7-12 present with substantive content (not thin summaries)
- [ ] Seared Lessons Register: ≥18 lessons (all from runlogs + any from clarescence)
- [ ] Grand Synthesis section: ≥30 lines — coherent meta-level statement
- [ ] wc -l ≤ 800
- [ ] Committed to repo with `feat(anneal):` prefix

### Risk

- **Blast radius**: New file only — no existing content modified
- **Rollback**: Trivial — new ARCH- file, no dependencies yet
- **Scope creep**: Agent may try to reproduce v2 sections verbatim. Instruction: condense v2
  sections to 30-50% of their current length to make room for the new layers
- **Ceiling risk**: 12 sections × ~60 lines avg = 720 lines. Tight but achievable.
