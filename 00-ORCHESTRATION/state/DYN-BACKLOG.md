*Backlog refreshed 2026-02-02 (Blitzkrieg 51 — low-hanging-fruit sweep). Ledger reconciliation: TASK-057-062 marked done (PROJ-016 8/8 confirmed), PROJ-002 stale due_date cleared, dependency graph percentages corrected (95/50/95). DYN log files initialized (SESSION_LOG, PEDIGREE_LOG, EXECUTION_STAGING) — hooks had never fired due to OS auto-update killing previous session. System state refreshed, handoff token regenerated (stale since Jan 22). .gitignore hardened (Obsidian workspace, Drive temp artifacts). Temp directories purged. Blitzkrieg counter 50→51.*
