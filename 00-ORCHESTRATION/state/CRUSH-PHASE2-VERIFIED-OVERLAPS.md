- `10895.md` → Clusters 1, 5
- `10537.md` → Clusters 5, 7
- `10957.md` → Clusters 6, 8
- `10963.md` → Clusters 6, 9
- `10427.md` → Clusters 3, 9
- `10999.md` → Clusters 3, 9
- `10899.md` → Clusters 7, 10
- `09853.md` → Clusters 4, 11

## Phase 4 Recommendations

**Pilot coalescence candidates** (strongest overlap, highest payoff):
1. **Cluster 3** (Vibe Coding) — 5 files, 4 folders, high operational value
2. **Cluster 1** (Post-Labor Economics) — 4 files, 4 folders, deep
3. **Cluster 2** (Consciousness) — 4 files including 1692-line deep treatment
4. **Cluster 9** (Multi-Agent Orchestration) — includes canon file, directly operational

**Caution**: Clusters 4, 8, 9 include canon files — coalescence must not violate canon protection. Sovereign approval required before any canon file modification.

**Cross-file overlap**: 8 files appear in 2+ clusters. Coalescence must handle these carefully — merging for one cluster may affect another.
