- **Intent**: Cron-dispatched sensing agents refresh MODEL-INDEX, SURVEY, DYN-PLATFORMS automatically
- **Priority**: P0 — Obsolescence acceleration demands self-correcting corpus
- **Linked**: INT-1209 (temporal intelligence refresh), INT-MI11 (live capability matrix)

- **Linked**: INT-C004 (corpus hygiene sprint)
- **Status**: 24 duplicates DELETED this session. IIC consolidation next.
