- **2026-02-07 10:01:06** | `**Priority**: P0`

### 2026-02-08 01:30 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: Agent Loop Architecture
- **Signal**: "We're no longer coding, but conducting logistics. Materiel = tokens, personnel = agents."
- **Intent**: Codify always-on agent loops (7-phase /claresce per agent) as operational standard
- **Priority**: P0 — This has been typed 3+ times and lost. Now persisted to ARCH-CONSTELLATION_AGENT_LOOPS.md
- **Linked**: INT-1202 (maximize velocity), INT-MI19 (Palantir-like ontology)
- **Actions**: Test plist watchers, update COCKPIT.md v3.0, activate Emacs Observation Layer
- **Captured by**: Commander (Claude Code session 2026-02-08)

### 2026-02-08 01:30 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: Expand tactical repertoire beyond Blitzkrieg
- **Signal**: "The blitzkrieg becomes the standard-bearer. Expect to expand tactics."
- **Intent**: Blitzkrieg as default MO, but develop additional multi-agent tactics
- **Priority**: P1 — Strategic evolution of orchestration patterns
- **Linked**: INT-1203 (5-platform constellation design)

### 2026-02-08 01:30 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: Live model capabilities ledger
- **Signal**: "This is why we need a live model capabilities/benchmark ledger, for efficacious routing"
- **Intent**: Create real-time model capability tracking for intelligent task routing
- **Priority**: P1 — Required for optimal agent dispatch
- **Linked**: INT-MI19 (ontology substrate)

### 2026-02-09 07:45 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: Live ledger infrastructure is P0
- **Signal**: "Data hours old is irrelevant. We need to spearhead this to the front of the line."
- **Intent**: Cron-dispatched sensing agents refresh MODEL-INDEX, SURVEY, DYN-PLATFORMS automatically
- **Priority**: P0 — Obsolescence acceleration demands self-correcting corpus
- **Linked**: INT-1209 (temporal intelligence refresh), INT-MI11 (live capability matrix)
- **Actions**: Cartographer as frontier scanner, launchd periodic dispatch, live ledger pipeline

### 2026-02-09 07:45 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: 02-ENGINE consolidation (mereological triage)
- **Signal**: "The corpus is proliferating and we do double work. Due for deeply contrived consolidation."
- **Intent**: Triage 02-ENGINE from 108 files to coherent pipelines. Delete duplicates, merge IICs, archive fossils.
- **Priority**: P1 — Prerequisite for live ledger pipeline (clean substrate first)
- **Linked**: INT-C004 (corpus hygiene sprint)
- **Status**: 24 duplicates DELETED this session. IIC consolidation next.

### 2026-02-09 07:45 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: Gastown competitive awareness
- **Signal**: "Please web search and deeply investigate 'gastown'. There's only going to be more from here."
- **Intent**: Maintain frontier awareness. Track multi-agent orchestration landscape. We're at the edges.
- **Priority**: P1 — Strategic intelligence, not operational
- **Linked**: INT-P006 (multi-agent outperforms single), frontier-landscape.md memory file
- **Analysis**: Gastown = 30 generic workers, $100/hr, Go+SQLite. Our moat: agent specialization, ontology, multi-model.

### 2026-02-09 07:45 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: OpenClaw model status (SEARED)
- **Signal**: "Both openclaw are now using oauth gpt-5.3-codex via account 1's chatgpt plus subscription"
- **Intent**: Anthropic blocked Claude Max OAuth for Ajna. Both Ajna+Psyche = GPT-5.3-codex. Maxed until ~10 daily.
- **Priority**: P0 — Operational constraint, plan dispatch around reset window
- **Linked**: DEC-LIVE-005 in CLARESCENCE-2026-02-09
