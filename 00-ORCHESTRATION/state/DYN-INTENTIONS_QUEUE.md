- **Intent**: Identify and close the capability gap between Claude Code and OpenClaw
- **Priority**: P1 — Strategic architecture alignment
- **Linked**: INT-1203, SOVEREIGN-011 Section 5

- **Linked**: INT-1509, DEC-SOV-006
- **Status**: RESOLVED — 3 new launchd services deployed, no cron usage

### 2026-02-09 03:00 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: Cascade to MacBook Air
- **Signal**: "We'll need to cascade it over, but with applied intent on how the laptop interaction dynamic should be configured"

- **Priority**: P1 — Infrastructure parity
- **Linked**: INT-1504, DEPLOYMENT-PLAYBOOK.md Cascade Differential, TASK-MBA-CASCADE.md
- **Status**: ACTIVE — playbook updated, Psyche task dispatched

- **2026-02-09 03:30:15** | `Yegge's "vibes-based decision-making" sounds mystical but is actually precise: it describes a system where evaluation criteria are too complex to formalize but can be recognized by sufficiently calibr`
