- **2026-02-07 10:01:06** | `**Priority**: P0`

### 2026-02-08 01:30 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: Agent Loop Architecture
- **Signal**: "We're no longer coding, but conducting logistics. Materiel = tokens, personnel = agents."
- **Intent**: Codify always-on agent loops (7-phase /claresce per agent) as operational standard
- **Priority**: P0 — This has been typed 3+ times and lost. Now persisted to ARCH-CONSTELLATION_AGENT_LOOPS.md
- **Linked**: INT-1202 (maximize velocity), INT-MI19 (Palantir-like ontology)
- **Actions**: Test plist watchers, update COCKPIT.md v3.0, activate Emacs Observation Layer
- **Captured by**: Commander (Claude Code session 2026-02-08)

### 2026-02-08 01:30 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: Expand tactical repertoire beyond Blitzkrieg
- **Signal**: "The blitzkrieg becomes the standard-bearer. Expect to expand tactics."
- **Intent**: Blitzkrieg as default MO, but develop additional multi-agent tactics
- **Priority**: P1 — Strategic evolution of orchestration patterns
- **Linked**: INT-1203 (5-platform constellation design)

### 2026-02-08 01:30 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: Live model capabilities ledger
- **Signal**: "This is why we need a live model capabilities/benchmark ledger, for efficacious routing"
- **Intent**: Create real-time model capability tracking for intelligent task routing
- **Priority**: P1 — Required for optimal agent dispatch
- **Linked**: INT-MI19 (ontology substrate)

### 2026-02-09 07:45 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: Live ledger infrastructure is P0
- **Signal**: "Data hours old is irrelevant. We need to spearhead this to the front of the line."
- **Intent**: Cron-dispatched sensing agents refresh MODEL-INDEX, SURVEY, DYN-PLATFORMS automatically
- **Priority**: P0 — Obsolescence acceleration demands self-correcting corpus
- **Linked**: INT-1209 (temporal intelligence refresh), INT-MI11 (live capability matrix)
- **Actions**: Cartographer as frontier scanner, launchd periodic dispatch, live ledger pipeline

### 2026-02-09 07:45 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: 02-ENGINE consolidation (mereological triage)
- **Signal**: "The corpus is proliferating and we do double work. Due for deeply contrived consolidation."
- **Intent**: Triage 02-ENGINE from 108 files to coherent pipelines. Delete duplicates, merge IICs, archive fossils.
- **Priority**: P1 — Prerequisite for live ledger pipeline (clean substrate first)
- **Linked**: INT-C004 (corpus hygiene sprint)
- **Status**: 24 duplicates DELETED this session. IIC consolidation next.

### 2026-02-09 07:45 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: Gastown competitive awareness
- **Signal**: "Please web search and deeply investigate 'gastown'. There's only going to be more from here."
- **Intent**: Maintain frontier awareness. Track multi-agent orchestration landscape. We're at the edges.
- **Priority**: P1 — Strategic intelligence, not operational
- **Linked**: INT-P006 (multi-agent outperforms single), frontier-landscape.md memory file
- **Analysis**: Gastown = 30 generic workers, $100/hr, Go+SQLite. Our moat: agent specialization, ontology, multi-model.

### 2026-02-09 07:45 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: OpenClaw model status (SEARED)
- **Signal**: "Both openclaw are now using oauth gpt-5.3-codex via account 1's chatgpt plus subscription"
- **Intent**: Anthropic blocked Claude Max OAuth for Ajna. Both Ajna+Psyche = GPT-5.3-codex. Maxed until ~10 daily.
- **Priority**: P0 — Operational constraint, plan dispatch around reset window
- **Linked**: DEC-LIVE-005 in CLARESCENCE-2026-02-09

- **2026-02-08 23:54:37** | `- **Part 3 (Always-on watchers + OpenClaw outfitment + canon observability)**: 32 items (IMPL-D-0034 to IMPL-D-0070)`

- **2026-02-08 23:55:05** | `   - Status: **ASPIRATIONAL** — Referenced in vision docs but not operationalized`

- **2026-02-09 00:32:49** | `Again commander, I want you to have maximum access become fiduciary status. For now https://skills.sh/vercel-labs/skills/find-skills I need you to install this skill, this should 10x our capabilities.`
- **Status**: DONE — find-skills skill installed via `npx skills add` to .agents/skills/ + .claude/skills/

### 2026-02-09 08:30 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: OpenClaw Pareto advantages
- **Signal**: "The Pareto advantage is (1) mobile dispatch, (2) root access, (3) always-on heartbeat"
- **Intent**: Identify and close the capability gap between Claude Code and OpenClaw
- **Priority**: P1 — Strategic architecture alignment
- **Linked**: INT-1203, SOVEREIGN-011 Section 5
- **Analysis**: Gap isn't capability (both have root access) — it's trigger mechanisms and persistence

### 2026-02-09 08:30 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: Commander fiduciary status
- **Signal**: "I want you to have maximum access become fiduciary status. What else can we install?"
- **Intent**: Commander should have all tools needed for full autonomous operation
- **Priority**: P1 — Operational independence
- **Linked**: SOVEREIGN-011 Section 3 (Commander Tool Gap Assessment)
- **Status**: Audited — 70% autonomous, 30% gap is daemon infrastructure (APScheduler, Chroma, Slack bot)

### 2026-02-09 08:30 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: Psyche capability encoding
- **Signal**: "Psyche doesn't know it can manipulate the computer"
- **Intent**: Encode full system access awareness into Psyche's memory
- **Priority**: P1 — Agent capability alignment
- **Linear**: SYN-35
- **Status**: TASK dispatched to -INBOX/psyche/

### 2026-02-09 08:30 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: Configuration cascade Mac mini -> MBA
- **Signal**: "We'll need to mirror all the CLI upgrades and cascade into the MacBook Air"
- **Intent**: Create installation playbook for replicating Mac mini configs on MBA
- **Priority**: P2 — Infrastructure parity
- **Linear**: SYN-34
- **Status**: TASK dispatched to -INBOX/psyche/

### 2026-02-09 08:30 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: Epics as sprint containers
- **Signal**: "Start using Epics terminology"
- **Intent**: Organize Linear issues into strategic groupings (Epic 1-4)
- **Priority**: P2 — Process improvement
- **Status**: ADOPTED — see SOVEREIGN-011 Section 7

### 2026-02-09 08:30 — SOVEREIGN INTENT: Apple Notes skill extraction
- **Signal**: "I have a bunch of other skills locked away in apple notes"
- **Intent**: Extract skills from Apple Notes into .claude/skills/ format
- **Priority**: P2 — Skill expansion
- **Linked**: SYN-36
- **Status**: PENDING — requires Sovereign to share Apple Notes content
