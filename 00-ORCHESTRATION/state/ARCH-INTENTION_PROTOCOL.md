# Intention Archaeology Protocol

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Created**: 2026-01-24
**Authority**: Ajna7

---

## Purpose

Every execution must align with the Intention Archaeology Compass. This protocol ensures work serves the destination, not just the immediate request.

---

## Compass Location

```
00-ORCHESTRATION/state/ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md
```

---

## Pre-Execution Checklist

Before any directive or significant artifact:

1. **CONSULT** ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md
2. **VERIFY** alignment with destination:
   - Syncrescendence as civilizational sensing infrastructure
   - 808 files → ~200 files
   - 18MB → ~2MB
   - Maximum semantics, minimum tokens
3. **CHECK** work is execution, not architecture-as-procrastination
4. **CONFIRM** work advances concrete compression goals
5. **ALERT** Sovereign if misaligned

---

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Designing instead of executing
- ❌ Meta-documentation about documentation
- ❌ Adding structure without removing content
- ❌ Proposing future work without completing current
- ❌ Architecture theater

---

## Sovereign Time Protection

Every interaction must:
- Produce deployment-ready artifacts
- Minimize relay overhead
- Enable parallel execution
- Close tasks, not open threads

---

## Update Protocol

If directive changes system direction:
1. Flag scope change explicitly
2. Propose ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md updates
3. Await Sovereign approval
4. Document in execution log
