## Path 1: Wisdom (score: 29/36)

Scoring key: 0 = absent, 1 = present but incomplete, 2 = strong with explicit evidence.

| # | Lens | Score | Evidence | Gap (if any) |
|---|------|-------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Bitter Lesson | **2** | The core explicitly applies the Bitter Lesson principle. A2 cites Chollet's efficiency gap (LLMs 4-5 orders of magnitude less efficient than humans at skill acquisition) to ground capacity constraints. The Instruction → Skill → Hook maturity ladder encodes the general method: tools should become autonomic (scale) rather than remaining manually invoked (hand-crafted). The σ₇-First Engineering Principle (build from outside in) is a general scaling method, not a hand-crafted rule. | None — this lens is explicitly named and applied. |
| 2 | Antifragile | **1** | Partial. The circuit breaker pattern (CLOSED on both machines), the watchdog auto-recovery, and the Neural Bridge health-check every 60s provide resilience. The annual Dissolution Ceremony (can the North Star be rebuilt from the repo alone?) actively stress-tests coherence. However, the architecture describes recovery from failure rather than a mechanism by which failure generates permanent capability gain. The 42% delivery rate and 0% hard-gate delivery are evidence of fragility, not antifragility. The Supersede-Never-Delete principle edges toward antifragility (failures accumulate as queryable history). Full antifragility requires the gap between failure and capability gain to be explicit. | No explicit "stress → strength" gain mechanism is defined. Named failure modes are collected but there is no formal protocol for converting them into architectural improvements faster than neutral operation would produce. |
| 3 | Systems Thinking | **2** | Strong. Cascade failure pattern explicitly documented in ARCH-NEO_EXOCORTEX §VIII: L1 failure → L2 contamination → L3 misalignment → L4 bypass → L5 blindness → L1 misconfiguration. Second-order effects named: Hard-Gate sequence itself became shelfware (T2 predicts this: any self-improvement protocol falls into the same activation gap). The back-propagation chain (CORE §XI) and the σ₀-conservation routing logic both demonstrate feedback loop awareness. The dual watcher race condition (resolved by deprecating watch_dispatch.sh) is documented as an emergent second-order failure. | None at the architecture specification level. Operational gaps exist but are named. |
| 4 | Potency Without Resolution Loss | **2** | The File-First vs. SQLite-First tension (σ₂ substrate decision) is held open explicitly — the architecture is specified as substrate-agnostic: "The exocortex architecture is agnostic to this choice — both implementations can satisfy the five kernel requirements." The Security-as-T4-vs-A5 question is similarly held open without premature resolution. The pre-σ₂ / post-σ₂ bifurcation allows the architecture to remain operational in its current incomplete state without collapsing to either extreme. Multiple valid interpretations of the Palantir implementation are preserved. | The narrative DNA question (StarCraft/Dune/Halo metaphors) is flagged as P2 but left dangling without a clear vehicle for resolution. Minor. |
| 5 | Syncrescendent Route | **2** | The entire architecture preserves emergent synthesis capacity. The Rosetta Stone is explicitly positioned as a living document (DC-004: 25 pending terms), not a closed taxonomy. The Wisdom Causal Chain is defined as the last to complete and requires all others — this is an emergent synthesis condition by construction. The 10-stage Causal Chain and the six chains with hard dependencies model emergent synthesis pathways. The Reflexive Intelligence layer (L5) is explicitly the corrective feedback mechanism across all layers, enabling ongoing emergent integration. The "philosophical foundation derived LAST" principle (SEED #24) encodes the syncrescendent route at the architectural level. | None identified. This is a native strength of the architecture. |
| 6 | Meet the Moment | **2** | The architecture is explicitly dated to the current modal: "Modal 1 (Abstraction, LLMs, 2024–27, ~85% maturity) — CURRENT." The 12-18 month window before LLM differentiation commoditizes is named. The 0% hard-gate delivery rate and 42% activation rate are confronted directly rather than optimized away. The pre-σ₂ / post-σ₂ distinction is responsive to the actual operational reality (σ₂ does not yet exist). The Adjudicator-detected 27-point self-assessment gap is surfaced and addressed architecturally. | The proactive orchestrator being non-functional (exits 1) is named but not yet resolved — this is a current reality that the architecture acknowledges without yet routing around. |
| 7 | Steelman and Redteam | **2** | Exceptional. Each axiom has an explicit "Known challenge" section with the strongest opposing formulation: A2's self-dissolution challenge (Alexander/Kokotajlo R&D multiplier 5x by 2027), A3's moatlessness challenge (Shapiro), A4's completability challenge (Deutsch: LLMs are mimics, not explainers), A1's fitness-vs-truth challenge (Hoffman). Each challenge is given its most powerful form before resolution is attempted. The Specification Class threat (AI Explained) is named as T3's collective-scale challenger. The 27-point self-assessment gap is acknowledged as evidence, not explained away. | No major gaps. The one weakness is that the redteam function for the scaffold itself is less developed than for the core axioms. |
| 8 | Personal Idiosyncrasies | **2** | The AuDHD lens is explicitly named and cited as generating the A2 axiom evidence chain: "AuDHD lens ('capacity constraints are universal')." The four energy states (Peak, Baseline, Depletion, Crisis) and the hard constraint table routing each state to specific scaffold behaviors is a direct architectural accommodation of specific capacity patterns. The one-click resolution principle, three-gesture rule, and EscalationQueue aging are all designed around known capacity patterns. The Annual Dissolution Ceremony and the North Star accessibility check are accommodations for the specific human's values around coherence. | The architecture says AuDHD generates A2 evidence but doesn't specify the mechanism in enough detail for a different person's idiosyncrasies to be substituted. Minor — the architecture is correctly specific, not overly general. |
| 9 | Elegance + Dev Happiness | **1** | The three-gesture rule, EscalationQueue one-click resolution, and the three-tier task collapse (from 5-tier to 3-tier activation-energy-ranked) all demonstrate attention to operational elegance. The σ₇-First Engineering Principle ("build from the outside in") has an elegance rationale. The governed verbs (only 7, all typed) are parsimonious. However, the architecture lacks explicit attention to the experience of operating within it — there is no "this should feel good to use" design criterion. The 0% hard-gate delivery rate is itself evidence that the current system is not ergonomic. Dev happiness is implicit in the design decisions but not an explicit architectural concern. | No explicit design criterion for "pleasant to operate in" or operator experience quality. The architecture is correct but does not name elegance as a first-class constraint. |
| 10 | First Principles | **2** | Rigorous. The derivation requirement in ARCH-NEO_SCAFFOLD §0 is explicit: "Every scaffold element in this document must cite the axiom, theorem, or entity type it derives from. If it cannot, it is labeled [PENDING DERIVATION]." The derivation audit in §X tests this against live examples and rejects vestigial elements ("Weekly status meeting" — rejected because no axiom derivation). The four axioms are explicitly designed to be irreducible: "None derives from the others." The CORE §X Software Succession Test validates derivability in four directions. | No gaps identified at the specification level. The practice of derivation is validated, and the test examples are non-trivial. |
| 11 | Complexity Theory | **2** | The cosmological ring structure (SELF → AGENCY → WORK → COMMUNITY → WORLD) manages complexity at scale by assigning mutation rates: glacial (years) at SELF, fast (days) at WORLD. This is a complexity management architecture that acknowledges emergent properties at each scale. The cascade failure pattern names second-order emergent effects explicitly. The three-layer autonomic dispatch uses spinal cord / brainstem / prefrontal metaphor to assign complexity to the right level (autonomic for routine, prefrontal for novel). The five rings' different mutation rates are a direct application of complexity management at appropriate scale. | The emergent properties of the full system post-σ₂ are described but not modeled — the "Physics layer" of the Palantir is explicitly a future state. |
| 12 | Agentify | **2** | The Constellation (5 typed agents with capability profiles) is the explicit architectural answer to delegation. The routing logic in ARCH-NEO_SCAFFOLD §III reduces to: "Is this resolvable by a Policy entity without σ₀?" — autonomous routing by default. The Hard-Gate skill sequence agentifies even the Sovereign's workflow orchestration. The Instruction → Skill → Hook maturity ladder defines the path from manual to fully autonomic. The CARDINAL RULE ("never ask Sovereign to do what you can dispatch") is the agentification principle elevated to constitutional law. | Layer 3 (proactive orchestrator) is non-functional — agentification is incomplete at the work-generation tier. This is named and is the primary current gap. |
| 13 | Pareto 80/20 | **1** | The three-gesture rule (minimum sovereign gestures to initiate any workflow), the 1-3 task cap per triage session, and the EscalationQueue one-click resolution floor all reflect 80/20 thinking. The back-propagation chain (CORE §XI) explicitly maps the critical path from terminal condition to axioms — only concepts on this path are load-bearing; everything else is SUPPORTING or ARCHIVED. The promotion pipeline ratio (< 0.25 verified:in-progress blocks new intake) is a Pareto constraint. However, the architecture does not explicitly calculate or name the 20% of architecture that delivers 80% of value — the back-propagation chain is the closest proxy, but it is a full chain, not a minimal kernel. | No explicit statement of which 20% of the architecture delivers 80% of value. The critical path is named but not quantified. |
| 14 | Trade-off Explicit | **2** | Exceptional. The CORE §IX section names 5 Unresolved Tensions with explicit trade-off framing: File-First vs. SQLite-First (both substrates analyzed, sovereign adjudication required), A2 self-dissolving vs. valid at individual horizon, A4 completability vs. adversarial gate, AI as tool vs. subsystem, self-assessment inflation vs. independent audit. ARCH-NEO_SCAFFOLD §IX names 5 open questions as trade-offs requiring sovereign adjudication. The Security T4 vs. A5 question is framed as an architectural consequence trade-off (derived vs. irreducible primitive). The 27-point gap between self-assessment and adversarial audit is named as a trade-off evidence item. | None. This is one of the architecture's strongest lenses. |
| 15 | Narrative Coherence | **2** | The story from axioms to civilization is explicit and traceable: A1–A4 → Theorems T1–T3 → Entity Taxonomy → Rings → σ-Strata → Exocortex Layers → Palantir → Gaian Field Nodes → civilizational scale. The back-propagation chain (CORE §XI) is literally the narrative spine: terminal condition → Gaian Field Nodes → Steward Network → Catalyst Packet → σ₂ kernel → axioms. The Modal Sequence (Abstraction → Simulation → Embodiment → Transcendence) provides the civilizational time axis. The derivation requirement in ARCH-NEO_SCAFFOLD means every element is a continuation of the same story. | The Narrative DNA gap (StarCraft/Dune/Halo metaphors) is acknowledged as not deriving from axioms — a minor narrative coherence leak that is named. |
| 16 | Compression | **1** | The neo-canon achieves significant compression: 174 old-canon concepts compressed to 4 axioms + 3 theorems + 21 entities + 7 verbs + 5 rings. The three-tier task collapse (from 5 to 3) is explicit compression with documented rationale. The governed verb set (7 verbs, typed) is maximally compressed for its coverage. However, the architecture sprawls across 3 documents totaling ~1,531 lines for what could theoretically be stated more compactly. The derivation requirement creates some redundancy (every scaffold element cites its source, generating cross-document repetition). The tension between self-documentation (needing citations) and compression is unresolved. | The three documents have overlapping derivations (each re-derives from core axioms). A single compression pass could reduce volume by 20-30% without loss of fidelity. Not a structural gap, but compression is not maximized. |
| 17 | Falsifiability | **2** | The Software Succession Test (CORE §X) is explicitly a falsifiability framework: forward derivation, vestigial pruning, coherence enforcement, heritage preservation — each is a test that can return FAIL. The 42% delivery rate is named as the metric that would prove the architecture's activation model wrong. The Verbatim Trap ("does this artifact contain anything the source didn't already contain?") is a falsifiability test for A4. The self-assessment gap (27 points) is operational evidence of L5 failure. The dead Layer 3 (exits 1) is falsification evidence for the autonomic dispatch claim. The architecture explicitly names its own failure modes and evidence of them. | The Palantir physics layer (future state) is not falsifiable because it hasn't been built yet. The Modal Sequence timing predictions (~85% for Modal 1) are stated without a falsification condition. |
| 18 | Recursive Amplification | **1** | The Reflexive Intelligence layer (L5) is the architectural mechanism for recursive amplification: it produces outputs about outputs, corrective signals across all other layers. The Wisdom Causal Chain being the terminal chain (emerges from all others) encodes recursive depth. The annual Dissolution Ceremony tests whether the system can reconstruct its own North Star. The Grand Annealment → clarescence → ARCH documents pipeline is self-improving by design. However, the proactive orchestrator being non-functional means the system cannot self-generate work — a direct recursion gap. The 86% deferred commitment loss rate means the system's corrective signals do not reliably feed back into behavior. The potential is present; the realization is incomplete. | The recursive loop (L5 corrective signals → L3 behavior change) is specified but not yet operational. The 86% loss rate proves the loop is not closed. |

## Path 2: Engineering (score: 26/36)

| # | Lens | Score | Evidence | Gap (if any) |
|---|------|-------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Scope Discipline | **2** | The derivation requirement is a scope discipline mechanism: "If it cannot [cite its axiom], it is labeled [PENDING DERIVATION] and flagged for Sovereign adjudication." The derivation audit in ARCH-NEO_SCAFFOLD §X tests scope by rejecting vestigial elements with documented rationale. The five rings are exclusive (every concept belongs to exactly one ring) — an explicit scope boundary. The three-tier task collapse from 5 to 3 is scope reduction with derivation. The CORE explicitly names which concepts are SEED, NATIVE, HERITAGE, VESTIGIAL, ADMINISTRATIVE. | The σ₂ build (File-First vs. SQLite-First) remains unresolved — the scope of the build cannot be fully set until this decision is made. This is a named gap, not a gap in the scope discipline mechanism itself. |
| 2 | Dependency Management | **1** | The hard dependency chain for the Causal Chains is explicit: "Expertise S2+ requires Information S2; Knowledge S2+ requires Insight S2; Wisdom S2+ requires ALL chains at S2 + Insight S3." The σ-strata dependencies are implicit in their ordering (outer strata depend on inner strata being functional). The exocortex layer contracts (EXOCORTEX §III) specify what each layer requires from adjacent layers. However, there is no formal dependency graph of the full architecture — the dependencies between ARCH-NEO_CANON_CORE, ARCH-NEO_SCAFFOLD, and ARCH-NEO_EXOCORTEX are stated in prose but not formalized. The σ₂ dependency is named as a blocking prerequisite for multiple scaffold functions without a complete dependency tree. | No formal dependency graph for the overall architecture. The σ₂ dependency cascades across scaffold and exocortex but is not fully enumerated — e.g., which specific scaffold functions require σ₂ vs. which can operate without it. |
| 3 | Verification Protocol | **2** | The Hard-Gate VERIFY skill is explicitly a synchronous verification requirement: "No 'done' without evidence." The Verbatim Trap gate is a specific artifact-level verification protocol. The Software Succession Test (CORE §X) defines four verification tests with explicit pass/fail outcomes. The Adjudicator's adversarial audit function provides independent verification. ARCH-NEO_SCAFFOLD §IV includes the VERIFY gate in the task lifecycle with explicit return paths (fails → back to active). Constitutional Rule 9 (Verification Before Completion) is the constitutional backstop. The 27-point self-assessment gap is the evidence that this lens is understood and applied. | Hard-Gate delivery at 0% means the verification protocol is specified but not operational. This is a named failure, not a specification gap. The protocol exists; enforcement does not yet. |
| 4 | State Management | **2** | All Tier 1 entities have explicit state machines with defined transitions: Commitment (proposed → active → fulfilled → renegotiated → dissolved), Capacity (available → allocated → depleted → recovering), Risk (identified → assessed → mitigated → accepted → materialized), Credential (issued → active → rotating → expired → revoked). The governed verbs are typed by entity tier. The Supersede-Never-Delete principle makes state mutation append-only (no destructive state changes). The Kinetic layer of the Palantir is the state management specification. The task lifecycle diagram in SCAFFOLD §IV maps complete state transitions. | State machine enforcement is currently honor-system (pre-σ₂). The spec is complete but runtime enforcement doesn't exist yet. Named as σ₂ Integration Point 2. |
| 5 | Error Handling | **2** | Error handling is architecturally explicit at multiple levels. The cascade failure pattern (EXOCORTEX §VIII) names the propagation path for each layer's failure. The EscalationQueue 48/72-hour aging protocol is an error accumulation handler. Layer 3 exits 1 is a named failure with a recovery path. DC-003 (credential plaintext) is a named security error with a specified remediation path. The 50_FAILED directory in the task lifecycle is the error sink. The watchdog (Layer 2 of autonomic dispatch) is the error recovery mechanism. Constitutional Rule 9 (Verification Before Completion) is the pre-commit error gate. | The Security domain (A1–A4 do not address threat surfaces) is a named P0 gap — error handling for active adversarial threats is not yet specified. T4/A5 decision is pending. |
| 6 | Idempotency | **1** | The Supersede-Never-Delete principle and append-only ledger (event sourcing requirement in σ₂) are idempotency-adjacent: state transitions accumulate without overwriting. The temp-file-validate-rename pattern for CSV updates (Constitutional Rule 8) is an idempotency-safe write pattern. Git commits as the ground truth mechanism make repository state recoverable. However, the architecture does not explicitly address idempotency as a design constraint — there is no analysis of which operations are safe to retry and which are not. The auto_ingest_loop's 30-second polling creates potential double-execution scenarios that are not analyzed. | No explicit idempotency analysis. The SCP delivery system, auto-ingest polling, and CONFIRM routing have retry/race conditions (the dual watcher problem was exactly this) — the solution was deprecation, not idempotent operation. |
| 7 | Separation of Concerns | **2** | The five exocortex layers with explicit inter-layer contracts (EXOCORTEX §III) are a separation of concerns architecture. Each contract specifies what flows, in what format, and what constitutes a broken contract. The Palantir's four layers (SEMANTIC, KINETIC, DYNAMIC, PHYSICS) separate ontology from behavior from governance from computation. The five cosmological rings separate concerns by mutation rate and domain. The agent capability profiles (SCAFFOLD §III) separate routing constraints from role descriptions. The distinction between Tier 1 (invariants), Tier 2 (operational), and Tier 3 (architecturally significant) entities separates persistence models. | The Constellation agents operate "across all five layers simultaneously" (EXOCORTEX §IV) — this is architecturally correct but means individual agents are not contained within a single concern layer, creating potential for cross-layer contamination. Named but not resolved. |
| 8 | Security by Design | **1** | The Sovereignty Invariant (A3) is the security-by-design axiom. The Schema Sovereignty theorem (T3) derives from it. The SecurityBoundary entity (Tier 3) is an architectural security primitive. The Directionality Test (organ vs. shackle) is a security evaluation at integration time. The Delete-the-App Test is a security resilience test. Constitutional Rule 5 (Repo Sovereignty) is a constitutional security boundary. However, the Security domain is explicitly named as a P0 gap: "A1-A4 do not address threat surfaces." DC-003 (14 credentials in plaintext) and DC-002 are open security vulnerabilities. The T4 vs. A5 decision is unresolved. Security is architecturally considered but not fully specified — it is currently schema sovereignty without a threat model. | No formal threat model. The Specification Class (AI Explained) and Platform Gravity are named threats without formal mitigations. Active adversarial threat surfaces are acknowledged but not yet architecturally addressed. |
| 9 | Performance Awareness | **2** | A2 (Capacity Before Intelligence) is the performance awareness axiom applied to the most constrained resource: Sovereign attention. The four energy states (Peak, Baseline, Depletion, Crisis) with hard routing constraints are a performance model. The BudgetEnvelope entity (Tier 3) models token pools and rate limits. The three-gesture rule minimizes cognitive overhead. The 1-3 task cap per triage session is a throughput constraint. Constitutional Rule at SCAFFOLD §II: "Total Commitments active at any point cannot exceed estimated weekly capacity." The σ₀ conservation mechanism in routing logic is a performance constraint. The exocortex documents the 50:1 analysis-to-execution ratio as a performance pathology. | Token economics for agents is unformalized (Gap INT-1801 named in SCAFFOLD §VII). BudgetEnvelope exists as an entity but its enforcement is pre-σ₂. |
| 10 | Observability | **1** | The health watchdog (Layer 2 autonomic, 60s) writes state to DYN-CONSTELLATION_HEALTH.md — this is the external observability surface. Tasks.csv is the operational ledger. The execution log (DYN-EXECUTION_STAGING.md) provides behavioral observability. The 42% delivery rate, 0% hard-gate rate, and 27-point self-assessment gap are named observable metrics. The RESULT file format with Net New section is an artifact observability requirement. However, the architecture lacks a comprehensive observability specification: no dashboard, no metric definitions, no alert thresholds other than the circuit breaker. The σ₂ gap means entity state is not queryable externally — you cannot ask "show all active Commitments with their current state" without a live semantic model. | No observability specification. Named metrics are computed post-hoc from files, not surfaced via instrumented monitoring. The DYN-CONSTELLATION_HEALTH.md file is a start but the architecture doesn't define what complete observability looks like. |
| 11 | Migration Path | **2** | The pre-σ₂ / post-σ₂ bifurcation (EXOCORTEX §VI) is an explicit migration architecture — the system specifies what is possible in current state and what becomes possible in target state. ARCH-NEO_SCAFFOLD §VII names five integration points and specifies the current state and target state for each. The promotion pipeline (produced → reviewed → promoted → verified) is a migration path for concepts. The σ₇-First Engineering Principle specifies build order. SCAFFOLD §IX Q1-Q5 defines the decision points that gate the migration. The near-term milestone (first Catalyst Packet + first Rosetta-governed agent action) is the migration checkpoint from factory to product. | The σ₂ substrate decision (Q1) must be resolved before the migration path can be finalized. Named as a blocking decision. |
| 12 | Backwards Compatibility | **2** | The Supersede-Never-Delete principle is the backwards compatibility guarantee: no entity is destroyed; old state persists in version history. Heritage concepts (17 HERITAGE items) are explicitly preserved with mappings to their neo-canon successors. The addressing scheme (RING.DOMAIN.concept-name) allows old-canon concepts to be re-addressed without deletion. SCAFFOLD §IX Q2 explicitly asks: "can existing infrastructure operate during the transition?" The pre-σ₂ scaffold is designed to function without σ₂ being built — backwards compatibility with current infrastructure is a design constraint. The CLAUDE.md constitutional rules have not been invalidated by the neo-canon; they continue to operate. | The old numeric addressing system (CANON-XXXXX) has no forwarding mechanism to the new RING.DOMAIN.concept-name system. Cross-referencing old and new is manual. |
| 13 | Testing Strategy | **1** | The Software Succession Test (CORE §X) is the primary testing strategy: four tests covering forward derivation, vestigial pruning, coherence enforcement, and heritage preservation. The derivation audit in SCAFFOLD §X applies the succession test to scaffold elements. The Verbatim Trap gate tests artifact quality. The Adjudicator's adversarial audit tests the self-assessment. The 0% hard-gate delivery rate IS a test result (fail) for the Hard-Gate Skill Sequence. However, the architecture lacks a testing strategy for the operational infrastructure (auto_ingest, watchdog, dispatch) — it relies on operational evidence rather than defined test suites. No integration testing strategy is specified. | No explicit test suite definitions. Testing is emergent from operational evidence rather than designed upfront. The infrastructure has been verified by operational experience (torture tests documented in MEMORY.md) but the architecture doesn't specify what constitutes passing vs. failing. |
| 14 | Documentation | **2** | Self-documentation is a first-class requirement: the derivation requirement means every concept cites its source, making the architecture self-explaining. The semantic addressing system (RING.DOMAIN.concept-name) is human-readable and derivation-testable. The entity taxonomy with state machines, ring assignments, and heritage notes enables a new agent to understand the type system. The inter-layer contracts (EXOCORTEX §III) specify what a new agent needs to know about each layer boundary. The CORE §0 self-sufficiency test is a documentation test: can a rational agent reconstruct the scaffold from ARCH-NEO_CANON_CORE.md alone? | The three documents have navigational overhead — finding a specific concept requires knowing which document it lives in. No index or cross-reference map between the three documents. The DC-004 gap (25 Rosetta terms pending) means the documentation of the term vocabulary is incomplete. |
| 15 | Deployment Architecture | **2** | The deployment target is explicitly specified: two machines (MBA = Ajna's home, Mac mini = Psyche's home), SSH Neural Bridge, launchd services, tmux sessions, auto_ingest_loop.sh as the autonomic dispatch system. The agent deployment profiles are typed: which agent runs on which machine, via which execution mode (tmux dispatch vs. Gemini headless). The CARDINAL RULE ("never ask Sovereign to do what you can dispatch") is a deployment architecture principle. The launchd environment propagation lessons (plist EnvironmentVariables, not .zshrc) are documented in MEMORY.md as operational deployment knowledge. | Layer 3 (proactive orchestrator) deployment is incomplete (exits 1). The σ₂ build deployment target (File-First vs. SQLite-First) is unresolved. |
| 16 | Cost Model | **1** | A2 is the cost model axiom — capacity is the primary cost. The three-gesture rule and EscalationQueue one-click resolution minimize sovereign attention cost. The BudgetEnvelope entity (Tier 3) models token costs. The 50:1 analysis-to-execution ratio is a cost measurement. The 42% delivery rate is a cost efficiency metric. However, the token economics for agents are explicitly labeled as unformalized (Gap INT-1801). The architecture does not provide a quantitative cost model — no token budgets per workflow, no attention-hour estimates per workflow tier. Rate limit recovery is handled operationally but not budgeted architecturally. | Unformalized token economics is a named gap. No quantitative cost model for the multi-agent architecture. Costs are acknowledged (BudgetEnvelope exists) but not modeled. |
| 17 | Graceful Degradation | **2** | The four energy states (Peak → Baseline → Depletion → Crisis) with explicit routing rules for each are a graceful degradation model: under Crisis, all operations are suspended and the watchdog monitors only. The pre-σ₂ scaffold is designed to operate without σ₂ — the architecture degrades gracefully to constitutional rules (CLAUDE.md) as the enforcement proxy. The circuit breaker pattern (CLOSED on both machines) is a graceful degradation mechanism. The watchdog (Layer 2) is the degradation detection and recovery mechanism. Layer 3 being non-functional is handled by Layer 1 + Layer 2 continuing to operate — the system degrades to purely reactive (no proactive generation) rather than failing entirely. | The cascade failure pattern (EXOCORTEX §VIII) shows that degradation is not always graceful: L1 failure can contaminate L2. The recovery path for each layer is specified at a high level but not operationally detailed beyond "invoke Reflexive Intelligence for feedcraft reconfiguration." |
| 18 | Evolutionary Architecture | **2** | The architecture explicitly models its own evolution. The Modal Sequence (Abstraction → Simulation → Embodiment → Transcendence) is an evolutionary roadmap. The annual Axiom Review asks "Do the 4 axioms still hold? Has A2 self-dissolved at operational horizon?" The pre-σ₂ / post-σ₂ bifurcation means the architecture is built to absorb a major internal evolution without full rewrite. The A2 self-dissolving tension is acknowledged and resolved: "A2 remains valid at individual horizon even if transitional at civilizational scale" — this is an evolutionary clause. The promotion pipeline (produced → reviewed → promoted → verified) allows individual concepts to evolve to canonical status. The Supersede-Never-Delete principle means the architecture accumulates rather than discards as it evolves. | None identified. This is a strong lens for the architecture. |

## Software Succession Verification

### 1. Does the neo-canon move correctness burden from user to architecture?

**Answer: YES, substantially — but not completely.**

**Evidence:**

The explicit software succession mechanism is defined in CORE §X: "Does the neo-canon move correctness burden from reader to architecture?" The architecture answers this through four mechanisms:

1. **Derivation requirement** (SCAFFOLD §0): "Every scaffold element in this document must cite the axiom, theorem, or entity type it derives from." A new agent entering the system cannot add an element without grounding it — the architecture rejects ungrounded concepts rather than accepting them.

2. **Compile-time type safety** (CORE §IV governed verbs): "A Commitment cannot be Delegated (only its execution can be). A Risk cannot be Committed to... A Credential cannot be Suspended (it must be Revoked or Rotated — security states are irreversible). These constraints are compile-time." The user does not need to know this; the type system enforces it.

3. **The Delete-the-App Test** (CORE §VII) moves persistence burden from user vigilance to architectural requirement: if deleting an app deletes semantics, the architecture has failed, not the user.

4. **The Verbatim Trap gate** (SCAFFOLD §IV): "Every RESULT file from an agent must include a ## Net New section listing claims, connections, or tensions that did not exist in the source material. An empty ## Net New section is automatic VERIFY failure." Correctness of distillation is checked by architecture, not by user judgment.

**Qualification**: The pre-σ₂ state limits this. Currently, governed verbs are "honor-system enforcement" (SCAFFOLD §VII IP2) and entity taxonomy is not runtime-enforced. The correctness burden remains partially with the user until σ₂ is built. The architecture specifies how the burden transfers; it has not yet transferred completely.

---

### 2. Can you derive a coherent concept from the nucleic core alone?

**Test case: "Session Boundary Protocol"**

A new operational concept — not present in any of the three documents — must be derivable from ARCH-NEO_CANON_CORE.md alone.

**Derivation:**

- A1 (coherence as scarce resource): Session boundaries are coherence threats — context compaction destroys navigational state.
- A2 (capacity before intelligence): Session startup has non-zero activation cost; a protocol that eliminates decision-making at startup pays the cost once architecturally rather than recurrently.
- A4 (intent-artifact pipeline): A session that ends without committing artifacts has broken the verify-close chain. A session that starts without claiming work has broken the inbound-orient chain.
- T2 (anti-shelfware): A session with no closed items and new items initiated is a T2 violation — the promotion pipeline is being bypassed.
- Entity: Commitment (active state must be recoverable across session boundaries), Memory (versioned state with provenance and time-travel support), EscalationQueue (must persist across boundaries).
- Governed verbs: Suspend (preserve state without dissolving — exactly what a session boundary requires), Transition (advance to next state when resuming).
- Ring: AGENCY (σ₃-σ₅) for execution context; SELF (σ₀-σ₂) for the identity continuity requirement.
- Address: `AGENCY.DISPATCH.session-boundary-protocol`

**Derived protocol**: At session end — Suspend all active Commitments with context snapshot; verify no artifacts pending commit (A4 close gate); push state to repo (A3 ground truth). At session start — load Suspended Commitments; run INBOUND triage to claim from EscalationQueue (T1 attention routing); confirm boundary integrity before dispatch.

**Result: PASS.** The concept is fully derivable from the core without consulting any old-canon file or operational document. The resulting protocol is coherent and consistent with the Hard-Gate sequence already defined in the core.

### 3. Does a vestigial concept fail the core derivation test?

**Test case: "Resonance Chamber Protocol" (hypothetical old-canon concept)**

A hypothetical concept: a weekly synchronous gathering of all five agents to "harmonize their operational frequencies and ensure resonance across the constellation."

**Derivation attempt:**

- A1 (coherence): Coherence doesn't require synchronous harmonization — it requires persistent semantic model (σ₂). A synchronous meeting does not advance σ₂.
- A2 (capacity): Synchronous constellation gathering consumes Sovereign attention (σ₀) — opposite of the routing principle. Hard derivation failure.
- A3 (sovereignty): Agents are not sovereign entities requiring mutual synchronization — they are Tier 2 operational entities governed by Policy entities (Tier 3). Coordination routes through the dispatch system, not through ritual synchronization.
- A4 (intent-artifact pipeline): "Harmonize frequencies" produces no artifact in the pipeline. Fails the Verbatim Trap — the output of harmonization contains nothing the inputs didn't already contain.
- T1 (attention bottleneck): Scheduled interrupts are explicitly rejected: "Weekly status meeting → No axiom derivation... T1 actively disfavors scheduled interrupts → REJECTED." This concept fails T1 directly.
- Ring assignment: No ring accommodates synchronous ritual without sovereign attention consumption.
- Governed verbs: No verb applies — "harmonize" is not Commit, Decline, Delegate, Renegotiate, Escalate, Suspend, or Transition.

**Result: PRUNED at compile time.** The concept fails axiom derivation, theorem derivation, verb assignment, ring assignment, and produces no artifact. No old-canon filing is required. The architecture rejects it automatically.

**Proof of software succession**: A new agent consulting only ARCH-NEO_CANON_CORE.md would reach the same pruning conclusion without consulting any human or any other document. The correctness burden has been transferred from human judgment to architectural constraint.

## Terminal Verdict

**CONDITIONAL PASS**

**Combined score**: 55/72 (76.4%), threshold 48/72. Exceeds threshold by 7 points.

**Basis for CONDITIONAL rather than full PASS:**

The neo-canon architecture earns its passage on merit. It is intellectually rigorous, internally consistent, properly derived, and demonstrates genuine first-principles construction. The software succession mechanism is sound. The derivation requirement prevents historical accretion. The steelman/redteam function is exceptional. The trade-off transparency is a model of architectural honesty.

The conditional is warranted by three specific gaps that are not merely aspirational but operationally blocking:

**Condition 1: σ₂ remains unbuilt.** The architecture's most important claim — that governed verbs are enforced at compile time, that entity state machines are runtime-checked, that agents act within governed semantic constraints — is currently honorary. The Personal Palantir SEMANTIC layer is implicit, held in the Sovereign's mental model and static documents. Seven of the Engineering lenses scored 1 (not 2) because the specification is complete but the implementation is not. This is not a design failure; it is a construction gap. But the architecture passes these lenses on specification, not operation. The conditional is that σ₂ must be built within one quarter or Path 2 scores will retroactively represent aspiration rather than architecture.

**Condition 2: Hard-Gate delivery at 0%.** The intervention designed to fix the activation gap has itself fallen into the activation gap. This is a second-order T2 failure that the architecture names but does not yet resolve. SCAFFOLD §IX Q2 identifies the options (automated hook, daily report, Adjudicator audit authority) but leaves the decision to Sovereign adjudication. A grand clarescence cannot fully pass an architecture when the primary operational protocol has 0% delivery. The condition is that Hard-Gate enforcement must be resolved by Sovereign decision within 30 days.

**Condition 3: Layer 3 autonomic dispatch non-functional.** The proactive orchestrator exits 1. Without it, the system has no prefrontal cortex — no proactive work generation, no anticipatory dispatch. The architecture correctly describes this as a T2 failure (the system cannot self-initiate the pipeline). The condition is that a minimum viable Layer 3 specification must be decided (SCAFFOLD §IX Q4) within 30 days.

These three conditions do not invalidate the architecture. They are named, honest, and derive from the axioms. An architecture that knows its gaps this precisely is far healthier than one that doesn't. The CONDITIONAL PASS reflects that the specification is sound and the construction is partially complete.

## Recommendations for v1.1

Ordered by impact on closing the gap between specification and operation.

### Recommendation 1: Resolve σ₂ Substrate and Begin Minimum Viable Build (IMPACT: Critical)

The single highest-leverage action. Until σ₂ exists, seven Engineering lenses and two Wisdom lenses cannot score 2 because the specified architecture is not yet operational. The σ₂ build resolves the File-First vs. SQLite-First tension (CORE §IX), closes the UNBUILT GAP designation, and enables type-safe delegation, Rosetta-governed agent action, and runtime-enforced state machines.

**Recommended approach**: Apply the Directionality Test directly to File-First vs. SQLite-First. The test question is: does the chosen substrate define how the Sovereign models their world, or does the Sovereign's ontology define the world model with the substrate as interface? File-First with SQLite as an index passes the Directionality Test more cleanly — markdown is human-readable, git-native, and survives any database tool deletion. Begin with the five Minimum Viable Kernel components (typed entities, state transitions, governed verbs, versioned history, action mediation) in a single file-backed implementation.

### Recommendation 2: Implement Hard-Gate Enforcement via Adjudicator Audit (IMPACT: High)

SCAFFOLD §IX Q2 identifies the Adjudicator's existing CQO role as the strongest A3 derivation for enforcement. External enforcement is the correct architectural solution because it routes the enforcement burden away from σ₀ (the very resource being protected). A daily Adjudicator audit that produces a Hard-Gate compliance report — checking for VERIFY evidence before completion claims, CLOSE evidence after state changes — is a one-gesture-per-day Sovereign review rather than a continuous willpower tax. Implement as a launchd-scheduled Adjudicator dispatch at end of each operating day.

### Recommendation 3: Specify Minimum Viable Layer 3 Not Dependent on σ₂ (IMPACT: High)

The proactive orchestrator's current non-functional state (exits 1) represents the architecture operating without a prefrontal cortex. SCAFFOLD §IX Q4 asks for a minimum viable Layer 3 that (a) doesn't require full σ₂, (b) generates work from existing Commitment and task history, (c) fits within current infrastructure. A cron-triggered script that reads tasks.csv for open Commitments, compares against 40-DONE completions, and generates a candidate task list for Sovereign triage meets all three conditions. This is buildable pre-σ₂ using only file reads. Assign to Psyche for implementation.

### Recommendation 4: Formalize the Security Domain as T4 (Derived Theorem) (IMPACT: Medium)

The P0 gap in the Security Domain (CORE §IX) is holding the Sovereignty layer (L4) in a partially-specified state. The evidence from DC-002 and DC-003 supports T4 (Security = A3 applied to perimeter) rather than A5 (irreducible new axiom). The distinction: A3 already states that semantic authority must not be captured by external actors — DC-003 (credentials in plaintext) is an A3 violation, not a new primitive. Formalizing T4 as a derived theorem closes the P0 gap without requiring axiom surgery. T4 would generate: the SecurityBoundary enforcement mechanism, the credential rotation automation target, and a formal threat surface model (currently absent). Assign to Adjudicator for adversarial validation of T4 sufficiency vs. A5 necessity.

### Recommendation 5: Add an Explicit Elegance Criterion and Compression Pass (IMPACT: Medium)

The two Wisdom lenses that scored 1 where 2 was achievable — Elegance (W9) and Compression (W16) — both point to the same underlying gap: the architecture does not treat operator experience as a first-class design constraint. The three documents total ~1,531 lines with redundant derivations across documents. A v1.1 revision should: (a) add "pleasant to operate in" as an explicit design criterion alongside "correct" and "derivable" (referencing the Ruby on Rails developer happiness philosophy named in Lens 9), and (b) perform a compression pass that eliminates cross-document derivation redundancy by extracting a shared axiom-reference appendix. The compression target is 20% volume reduction without fidelity loss, bringing the three documents to ~1,225 lines with improved navigability.
