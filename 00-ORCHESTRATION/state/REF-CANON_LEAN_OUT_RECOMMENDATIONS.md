## Context

A reimagination exercise compressed the 82-document CANON into 8 essential documents (NEW-CANON 2.0). The reimagination is too aggressive for wholesale adoption (token-constrained one-shot, loses cosmological depth and granular chain content), but it reveals **consolidation patterns** that can inform incremental lean-out.

---

## Key Insights from the Analysis

### 1. Gravitational Center
All 82 documents orbit a single principle: **"Consciousness can systematically evolve itself through measurement, differentiation, integration, technology, and transmission."** Documents that merely restate this without adding operational specificity are consolidation candidates.

### 2. Tier Structure (confirmed coherent)
- **Cosmos** (CANON-00000 to 00017): 18 constitutional documents — most redundancy here
- **Core** (CANON-10000, 11000): 2 documents — tight, keep as-is
- **Lattice** (CANON-20000 to 25210): 13 documents — some consolidation possible
- **Chains** (CANON-30000 to 35210): ~50 documents — least redundant, most operational
- **Historical** (CANON-99000): 1 document — keep as-is

### 3. Metaphor Shift: Cosmological → Vectorial
NEW-CANON replaces "celestial bodies orbiting" with "vectors in capability space." The helix visual (visual.png) bridges both — orbital planes with helical trajectories. The actual CANON should retain the cosmological metaphor (it's distinctive and memorable) but could benefit from vectorial language in operational sections.

## Consolidation Candidates (by tier)

### Cosmos Tier — Highest Redundancy

| Documents | Overlap | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| CANON-00004 (Evolution) + CANON-99000 (Historical) | Both track framework evolution history | Could merge; 99000 subsumes 00004's content |
| CANON-00006 (Corpus) | Pure manifest/catalog | Could be auto-generated from file system rather than manually maintained |
| CANON-00007 (Evaluation) + CANON-00008 (Resolutions) | Irresolutions + responses | Natural pair; consider merging into single "Evaluation & Resolutions" |
| CANON-00009 (Strategy) + CANON-00012 (Modal Sequence) | Strategic timeline + technology-gated phasing | Significant overlap in temporal roadmap |
| CANON-00010 (Operations) + CANON-00014 (Content Protocol) | Daily operations + content production | Both are "what to DO" — could merge operational sections |
| CANON-00011 (Artifact Protocol) | Meta-framework governance | Low-traffic reference; archive candidate if governance simplified |

**Estimated consolidation**: 18 → ~12 documents (6 merges)

### Lattice Tier — Moderate Redundancy

| Documents | Overlap | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| CANON-25000 (Memory Arch) + CANON-25010 (Memory Teleology) | Architecture + rationale for same system | Could merge; teleology becomes intro section |
| CANON-25200 (Constellation Arch) + CANON-25210 (Constellation Teleology) | Same pattern as above | Could merge |
| CANON-20010 (Dimensional Coordinators) + CANON-20020 (Meta-Systems) | Both support the Cognitive Palace infrastructure | Could merge into Palace appendix |

**Estimated consolidation**: 13 → ~10 documents (3 merges)

### Chain Tier — Lowest Redundancy

Chain documents are already operational and distinct. No consolidation recommended at this time. However, the lunar/satellite documents (~45) within each chain vary in quality and could benefit from quality triage.

## SN Variable System Implications

The consolidation exercise reveals concepts that repeat across many documents and should become SN variables (DEF blocks):

| Concept | Appearances | Variable Candidate |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Six chains + names | ~40 documents | `$CHAINS`, `$CHAIN_NAMES` |
| Seven Pulses | ~15 documents | `$SEVEN_PULSES` |
| Five Faces / ModusOperandi | ~10 documents | `$FACES` |
| Cognitive Palace layers | ~12 documents | `$PALACE_LAYERS` |
| Avatar/Platform mapping | ~20 documents (ENGINE+ORCHESTRATION) | `$CONSTELLATION` |
| Modal Sequence + timeline | ~8 documents | `$MODAL_SEQUENCE` |
| Energy States | ~10 documents | `$ENERGY_STATES` |
| Omni-Qualities | ~6 documents | `$OMNI_QUALITIES` |

If these become DEF blocks, updating a chain name or avatar mapping propagates globally through SN decode/expand.

## What NOT to Do

1. **Don't wholesale replace** — The 82-doc CANON has depth the 8-doc version can't match
2. **Don't lose cosmological metaphor** — It's distinctive intellectual property
3. **Don't merge chain-level docs** — They're operational and distinct
4. **Don't auto-consolidate without reading** — Each merge needs Sovereign review of what gets preserved vs compressed

---

## Recommended Sequence

1. **Immediate**: Define SN DEF variables for the 8 repeating concepts above
2. **Phase 1**: Merge the 3 obvious pairs (Memory+Teleology, Constellation+Teleology, Evaluation+Resolutions)
3. **Phase 2**: Auto-generate CANON-00006 (Corpus) from filesystem instead of manual maintenance
4. **Phase 3**: Sovereign-reviewed merges of Strategy+Modal, Operations+Content, Evolution+Historical
5. **Ongoing**: Quality triage of chain lunar/satellite documents

**Estimated result**: 82 → ~70 documents with no information loss, plus SN variables enabling global updates.
