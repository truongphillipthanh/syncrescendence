# ORACLE 10 — FINAL SUMMARY

**Duration**: 2026-01-05 to 2026-01-08
**Sessions**: Multiple (Blitzkrieg 39-42)
**Status**: COMPLETE

- **19 CANON integrations** (near 20 target)
- **11 CANON files enriched**
- Processing pipeline proven and documented

### PROJ-011: Automation Infrastructure
- **CLAUDE.md** deployed with constitutional rules
- **4 custom commands** (verify, process-source, update-ledgers, blitzkrieg)
- **Makefile** with 5 standard targets
- **MCP configuration** documented
- **coordination.yaml** defining zone ownership
- **5 automation scripts** in scripts/

## Key Learnings

### What Worked
1. **Blitzkrieg methodology** — Comprehensive packages with parallel streams
2. **Infrastructure-first** — PROJ-011 before PROJ-002 was correct reordering
3. **Research integration** — Deep research directly informed directives
4. **Ledger discipline** — Atomic updates, verification before completion

### What to Improve
1. **Root pollution** — Need cleanup_root.sh automation from start
2. **Research artifacts** — Protocol needed earlier
3. **Multi-account utilization** — Claude 2/3 web apps underutilized

## Handoff to Oracle 11

### Ready for Execution
- **PROJ-002**: IIC Configuration (P1, unblocked)
- **PROJ-012**: Multi-CLI Onboarding (P2, unblocked)
- **PROJ-014**: Multi-Account Synchronization (P2, unblocked)

### Requires Decisions
- ChatGPT Plus subscription for Codex CLI
- Claude Project system prompt content

### Context Documents
- `ORACLE10_CONTEXT_FINAL.md` (this document)
- `DYN-BACKLOG.md` (updated)
- `coordination.yaml` (zone ownership)
- `CLAUDE.md` (constitutional rules)

## Oracle 11 Recommended Focus

1. **PROJ-002 (IIC)** — High impact, unblocked, defines information architecture
2. **PROJ-012 (Multi-CLI)** — Expands execution capacity
3. **PROJ-014 (Multi-Account)** — Utilizes idle resources

**Defer**: PROJ-013 (System Prompt) until PROJ-002 clarifies memory architecture.

---

## Blitzkrieg Pattern (Validated)

The blitzkrieg pattern used in Oracle 10 is validated and should continue:

1. **Pre-blitz research** — Deep context gathering before directive creation
2. **Parallel streams** — Claude 2 + Claude 3 executing simultaneously
3. **Comprehensive packages** — All context in directive, no Principal relay mid-execution
4. **Ledger discipline** — Immediate task/project updates, verification before completion
5. **Git discipline** — Frequent commits with semantic messages

*Oracle 10 complete. Infrastructure solid. Backlog clear. Oracle 11 ready.*
