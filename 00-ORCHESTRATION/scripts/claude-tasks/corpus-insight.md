## Task: Daily Corpus Insight

Analyze the Syncrescendence repo's recent activity and generate actionable insights.

### Steps

1. Read the last 10 git log entries from the repo at `/Users/home/Desktop/syncrescendence`:

```bash
cd /Users/home/Desktop/syncrescendence && git log --oneline -10
```

2. Check for any files modified in the last 24 hours:

```bash
cd /Users/home/Desktop/syncrescendence && find . -name "*.md" -mtime -1 -not -path "./.git/*" | head -30
```

3. Read `/Users/home/Desktop/syncrescendence/00-ORCHESTRATION/state/DYN-GLOBAL_LEDGER.md` — look at the last 20 lines for recent activity.

4. Read `/Users/home/Desktop/syncrescendence/00-ORCHESTRATION/state/ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md` — check active intentions and their statuses.

5. Write a brief insight report to `/Users/home/Desktop/syncrescendence/agents/commander/inbox/pending/TASK-CORPUS-INSIGHT-$(date +%Y%m%d).md` with this format:

```markdown
# Corpus Insight Report — YYYY-MM-DD

**Generated by**: claudecron/corpus-insight
**Status**: PENDING

## Activity Summary
- Commits (last 24h): N
- Files modified: N
- Active intentions: N

## Velocity Assessment
(Is work progressing on stated intentions? What's stalled?)

## Orphaned Work
(Files modified that don't map to any active intention or Linear issue)

## Recommendations
(1-3 concrete next actions)
```

6. Print the report to stdout.

Keep the analysis brief and actionable. Focus on misalignment between stated intentions and actual work.
