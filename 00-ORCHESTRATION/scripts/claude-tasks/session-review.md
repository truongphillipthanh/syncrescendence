## Task: Daily Session Review

Review the day's execution logs and produce a summary of progress vs intentions.

### Steps

1. Read the execution staging log:

```bash
cat /Users/home/Desktop/syncrescendence/00-ORCHESTRATION/state/DYN-EXECUTION_STAGING.md
```

2. Read the session log:

```bash
cat /Users/home/Desktop/syncrescendence/00-ORCHESTRATION/state/DYN-SESSION_LOG.md | tail -50
```

3. Read the global ledger for today's entries:

```bash
grep "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" /Users/home/Desktop/syncrescendence/00-ORCHESTRATION/state/DYN-GLOBAL_LEDGER.md || echo "No entries for today"
```

4. Read the intention compass for active priorities:

```bash
head -100 /Users/home/Desktop/syncrescendence/00-ORCHESTRATION/state/ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md
```

5. Write a daily review to `/Users/home/Desktop/syncrescendence/agents/commander/inbox/pending/TASK-SESSION-REVIEW-$(date +%Y%m%d).md`:

```markdown
# Daily Session Review — YYYY-MM-DD

**Generated by**: claudecron/session-review
**Status**: PENDING

## Sessions Today
(List each session with: start time, duration, key deliverables)

## Intention Alignment
| Intention | Progress Today | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| INT-XXX | What happened | On track / Stalled / Blocked |

## Commits Today
(List commits with semantic prefixes)

## Tomorrow's Priority
(Based on intention alignment, what should tomorrow's first session focus on?)

## Token Economics
(Rough estimate of API spend today if inferable from session count)
```

6. Print the summary to stdout.

Be analytical, not descriptive. Focus on gaps between intention and execution.
