# DIRECTIVE-043A: PLATFORM CONSTELLATION ARCHITECTURE
## Stream A — Claude 2 (Alpha)

**Issued**: 2026-01-11
**Authority**: Oracle 12 under Sovereign direction
**Stream**: A (Claude 2)
**Priority**: P0 — Strategic Architecture
**Estimated Duration**: 60-90 minutes
**Parallel**: DIRECTIVE-043B executing simultaneously on Claude 3

---

## DECISION CONTEXT

### Sovereign's Actual Words
> "Claude Code wielded by Claude Opus 4.5 represents a seismic step change. I have experienced it for myself. We are retaining all 3 Claude Pro accounts for the rest of this month... design/architect for 3 Claude + 1 Gemini + 1 ChatGPT paid."

> "It's imperative we capitalize on these heavy machinery to construct as much of the Syncrescendence and match pace, as it's only going to accelerate from here."

> "The Intention Archaeology Compass extracts from [Oracle conversations] as a linguistic heuristical holism instrument, that may even be useful to the model."

### Oracle's Interpretation
The platform configuration has shifted from redundant Claude accounts to a purpose-specialized constellation. This directive designs the formal architecture for the 5-platform system, including the unified Intention Archaeology Compass as a function of Oracle Pedigree.

### 18-Lens Evaluation Summary
16/18 lenses pass. This architecture gains strength from constraints: platform specialization maps to task types, multi-agent outperforms single-agent by 90.2%.

## V. SUSTAINABILITY ROADMAP

Goal: Accounts self-sustaining by month-end (2026-01-31)

[Document path to revenue generation to cover $100/month platform costs]
```

### Task 1.2: Update CANON-25100-CONTEXT_TRANS with Oracle Pedigree

Add new section to existing [[CANON-25100-CONTEXT_TRANS-lattice]]:

```markdown
## ORACLE PEDIGREE PROTOCOL

### Purpose
As work moves from web app to repository, traditional handoff documents become less necessary. The Oracle Pedigree provides:
1. Historical lineage tracking (Oracle 0 → current)
2. Decision archaeology (what was decided and why)
3. Multi-model integration (tracks decisions across platforms, not just Claude)

### Pedigree Components
- **Thread ID**: Oracle number (e.g., Oracle 12)
- **Campaign/Phase**: Strategic context (e.g., Campaign Phase 2: Architecture)
- **Decisions Made**: Enumerated with Sovereign's words, rationale, 18-lens score
- **Artifacts Produced**: Files created/modified
- **Handoff State**: What next Oracle needs to know

### Relationship to Handoff Documents
Handoff documents remain useful for:
- Session initialization prompts
- Context restoration across model resets
- Cross-platform synchronization

Pedigree supersedes handoff for:
- Decision archaeology
- Multi-model coordination
- Repository-centric workflows
```

---

## PHASE 2: INTENTION ARCHAEOLOGY COMPASS
**Duration**: ~30 minutes

### Sovereign's Words
> "The intention archaeology compass should be unified. All intentions are compounding vectors that are interdependent... In essence, it's a cache, but it's also a rolling snapshot."

### Task 2.1: Create ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md

Design the unified compass as metadata-structured document:

```markdown
# INTENTION ARCHAEOLOGY COMPASS
## Oracle Pedigree Extraction Instrument
**Last Updated**: [timestamp]
**Oracle Lineage**: 0 → 12
**Status**: Rolling snapshot

---

## SCHEMA

Each intention entry contains:
```yaml
- id: INT-XXXX
  oracle: [origin Oracle number]
  timestamp: [ISO datetime]
  category: [urgent|sprint|backlog|pattern|capture]
  priority: [P0|P1|P2|P3]
  status: [active|resolved|superseded|deferred]
  text: "[Sovereign's actual words]"
  interpretation: "[Oracle's understanding]"
  blocked_by: [null|dependency]
  integrated_into: [null|CANON/task/decision]
  notes: "[additional context]"
```

---

## ACTIVE INTENTIONS

### URGENT (Address NOW)
[Intentions requiring immediate action]

### SPRINT (Integrate at Checkpoint)
[Intentions for current sprint cycle]

### BACKLOG (Future Work)
[Intentions queued for later Oracles]

### PATTERNS (Meta-Observations)
[Recurring themes, successful patterns, anti-patterns]

### CAPTURE (Undifferentiated Inbox)
[Raw captures pending categorization]

---

## EXTRACTED FROM ORACLE 12

| ID | Category | Text | Status |
|----|----------|------|--------|
| INT-0001 | urgent | "accounts become self-sustaining by month end" | active |
| INT-0002 | sprint | "audit and anneal the corpus again for alignment/congruence" | active |
| INT-0003 | sprint | "attached reports ought to be canonized" | active |
| INT-0004 | pattern | "automation infrastructure must precede content work" | resolved |
| INT-0005 | backlog | "Manus before Perplexity" | deferred |
| INT-0006 | backlog | "promos for Perplexity and additional Gemini account" | deferred |

---

## INTEGRATION PROTOCOL

1. **Extraction**: During Oracle session, Sovereign's intentions captured verbatim
2. **Categorization**: Oracle assigns category and priority
3. **Tracking**: Compass updated as intentions resolve or evolve
4. **Archaeology**: Historical intentions preserved for pattern analysis
```

### Task 2.2: Extract Intentions from Oracle 0-12

Review available Oracle documents and extract key intentions into the compass. Focus on:
- Unresolved commitments
- Recurring themes
- Pattern observations
- Dependencies and blockers
