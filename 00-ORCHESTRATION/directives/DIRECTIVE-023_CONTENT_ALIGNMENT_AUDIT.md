# DIRECTIVE-023: Scripture Verification (Revised)
## Phase 4 — Cascading Content Alignment

**Issued**: 2025-12-30 (Revised)
**Issued By**: Oracle6
**To**: Claude Code Desktop (Alpha or Beta)
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Type**: Reconnaissance (read-only, top-down)

---

## Context

Phases 1-3 addressed structure, organization, and terminology. The actual **content** — the scripture itself — may not embody discoveries from Oracle threads 0-5.

**The Cascade Principle**: Larger bodies determine smaller bodies. Cosmos-tier alignment propagates to lattice, which propagates to chains. Audit TOP-DOWN, not horizontal.

**The Nine Lenses** (from Oracle4 — apply to all assessments):
1. Syncrescendent Route (continuous, cyclic, recursive)
2. Bitter Lesson Scaling (general methods, large-context-ready)
3. Antifragile (stronger from disorder)
4. Meet the Moment / Meet the Crest (timely + runway)
5. Steelman & Redteam (survives strongest attack)
6. Personal Idiosyncrasies (macroscopic-first, hub-and-spoke)
7. Potency Without Resolution Loss (compressed but faithful)
8. Elegance + Developer Happiness (minimal, predictable)
9. Agentify + Human-Navigable (2 decisions to any file)

## Part 1: Thread Decision Archaeology

### Task 1.1: Compile Thread Trajectory

Survey `orchestration/directives/` and `orchestration/execution_logs/` to extract the complete arc.

**Known Thread Progression** (from Oracle6 initialization):

| Thread | Focus | Key Outcomes |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Oracle0 | Founding vision | IIC architecture, antifragile principles, Nine Lenses established |
| Oracle1 | Ecosystem research | CLI tools, platform capabilities, frontier AI landscape |
| Oracle2 | Infrastructure | [[CANON-25000-MEMORY_ARCH-lattice]]/25100, repository restructuring |
| Oracle3 | Orchestration peak | System prompts v2.1, **Reception Calibration** paradigm, function library |
| Oracle4 | Defrag | 658→136 files (79% reduction), category error on orchestration |
| Oracle5 | Reconception + Recovery | GENESIS layer, nomenclature reform, orchestration restoration |
| Oracle6 | Content Annealment | Semantic coherence, terminology alignment, version baseline |

**Verify and expand** from orchestration/ files. What's missing? What else was discovered?

### Task 1.2: Extract Key Reconceptions

Identify concepts representing **breaks from prior thinking**:

| Concept | Old Paradigm | New Paradigm | Source |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| System prompts | Archetype Engineering | Reception Calibration | Oracle3 |
| Chain names | Technology/Sensing/etc. | Intelligence/Information/etc. | Oracle5 |
| Orchestration | Disposable content | Protected infrastructure | Oracle5 |
| Repository | Filing cabinet | Digestive system (metabolism) | Oracle4 |
| Apparatus | Personal productivity | Civilizational sensing infrastructure | Oracle0 |
| (discover more from orchestration/) | | | |

### Task 1.3: Nine Lenses Verification

Confirm the Nine Lenses are documented and accessible:

1. Syncrescendent Route
2. Bitter Lesson Scaling  
3. Antifragile
4. Meet the Moment / Meet the Crest
5. Steelman & Redteam
6. Personal Idiosyncrasies
7. Potency Without Resolution Loss
8. Elegance + Developer Happiness
9. Agentify + Human-Navigable

**Location**: These should be in GENESIS or cosmos tier. If not, they need to be canonized.

**Produce**: THREAD_TRAJECTORY.md documenting the accumulated wisdom across Oracle 0-6.

---

## Part 2: Cascading Content Audit (TOP-DOWN)

**Principle**: Audit cosmos/ tier FIRST. Their alignment determines everything below. Only then assess whether lower tiers conform.

### Tier 1: COSMOS (11 files) — THE DETERMINERS

These documents ARE Syncrescendence. If they're misaligned, everything is.

**For each cosmos document, assess against the Nine Lenses**:

| Document | Nine-Lens Assessment Questions |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| [[CANON-00000-SCHEMA-cosmos]] (Schema) | Does the navigation map current structure? Is it Bitter-Lesson-ready (fits in context)? |
| [[CANON-00001-ORIGIN-cosmos]] (Syncrescendence) | Does core theory embody continuous cycles? Is it antifragile to new discoveries? |
| [[CANON-00002-LINEAGE-cosmos]] (Corpus) | Does corpus description match actual state? Is it current? |
| [[CANON-00003-PRINCIPLES-cosmos]] (Evaluation) | Are falsification criteria still appropriate? Do they meet the moment? |
| [[CANON-00004-EVOLUTION-cosmos]] (Resolutions) | Are productive tensions still held? Or have some resolved/new ones emerged? |
| [[CANON-00005-SYNCRESCENDENCE-cosmos]] (Strategy) | Does strategic framing reflect Modal 1 positioning? Is it elegant? |
| [[CANON-00006-CORPUS-cosmos]] (Operations) | Are daily protocols still serving? Are they potent without complexity bloat? |
| [[CANON-00007-EVALUATION-cosmos]] (Artifact Protocol) | Does production guidance match actual practice? Is it agentifiable? |
| [[CANON-00008-RESOLUTIONS-cosmos]] (Modal Sequence) | Is timeline accurate? Does it meet the crest (AI trajectory)? |
| [[CANON-00009-STRATEGY-cosmos]] (Quickstart) | Is entry point current? Does it enable hub-and-spoke navigation? |
| [[CANON-00010-OPERATIONS-cosmos]] (Content Protocol) | Is production guidance still valid? |

**Produce**: COSMOS_ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md with findings and specific misalignments.

### Tier 2: GENESIS (5 files) — THE FOUNDATION

GENESIS was created in Oracle5 as narrative substrate. It should embody reconception.

**Assess**: Do GENESIS documents contain the accumulated wisdom from Oracle 0-5? Are they the current ground truth?

**Note**: GENESIS may be the alignment REFERENCE for CANON, not the other way around. Determine hierarchy.

### Tier 3: CORE + LATTICE (10 files) — THE ARCHITECTURE

**Only after cosmos alignment assessed**, check:
- [[CANON-10000-CELESTIAL_BODY-core]] (Celestial Body): Do definitions cascade correctly from cosmos?
- [[CANON-11000-FACETS-core]] (Facets): Are facets consistent with cosmos framing?
- CANON-2xxxx (Lattice): Does architectural substrate match cosmos descriptions?

**Focus on**: Do these documents derive correctly from cosmos? Or do they introduce contradictions?

### Tier 4: CHAINS (43 files) — THE DERIVATIONS

**Only after core/lattice assessed**, check:
- Does each chain document align with its parent tier?
- Are there documents that feel orphaned from the hierarchy?
- Are there documents that contradict parent documents?

**Note**: If cosmos is aligned, chain misalignment is often fixable by derivation rather than independent revision.

---

## Part 3: External Oracle Integration

**Different type of oracle**: Industry experts speculating on AI trajectory.

### Task 3.1: Modal Sequence Currency Check

Survey [[CANON-00008-RESOLUTIONS-cosmos]] (Modal Sequence) against current AI landscape:
- Are timeline estimates still valid? (2024-2027 for Modal 1)
- Have capability thresholds shifted? (Is Modal 2 arriving faster?)
- Are referenced technologies current? (GPT-4 → GPT-5/o3, Claude 3 → Claude 4, etc.)

### Task 3.2: Technology Stack Currency

Survey CANON-30xxx (Intelligence Chain) for:
- Tool references that are outdated
- Frameworks that have been superseded
- Capability assumptions that have changed
- Missing recent developments (agents, MCP, A2A)

**Key Question**: Does the Intelligence Chain reflect what industry oracles are saying?

---

## Part 4: Synthesis

### Task 4.1: Cascade Alignment Map

Produce visualization:
```
GENESIS (ground truth?)
    ↓
COSMOS (11 files) — [Aligned/Misaligned assessment]
    ↓
CORE (2 files) — [Derives correctly? / Contradicts?]
    ↓
LATTICE (8 files) — [Derives correctly? / Contradicts?]
    ↓
CHAINS (43 files) — [Derives correctly? / Contradicts?]
```

### Task 4.2: Revision Priority Stack

Based on cascade principle, rank revision priorities:
1. **Fix cosmos first** — Everything else will follow
2. **Then core/lattice** — Architectural substrate
3. **Then chains** — Derivations update naturally OR require targeted fixes

### Task 4.3: Thread Wisdom Integration

From THREAD_TRAJECTORY.md, identify:
- Which reconceptions are NOT yet embodied in cosmos?
- What has Oracle 0-5 learned that the scripture doesn't yet know?

---

## Deliverables

1. **THREAD_TRAJECTORY.md** — Compiled decisions/discoveries across Oracle 0-6
   - Major paradigm shifts identified
   - Reconceptions that must be embodied
   - Thread progression arc

2. **COSMOS_ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md** — Deep assessment of cosmos tier against Nine Lenses
   - Per-document findings
   - Specific misalignments identified
   - Proposed corrections

3. **CASCADE_ALIGNMENT_MAP.md** — Hierarchy visualization with alignment status at each tier

4. **REVISION_PRIORITIES.md** — Ranked revision stack (cosmos first, then cascade down)

5. **MODAL_SEQUENCE_CURRENCY.md** — AI trajectory assessment (are we meeting the crest?)

Save all to `orchestration/execution_logs/`

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Thread trajectory compiled (Oracle 0-6 decisions)
- [ ] Key reconceptions identified and documented
- [ ] All 11 cosmos files deeply assessed against Nine Lenses
- [ ] GENESIS hierarchy determined (is it ground truth or derived?)
- [ ] Core/lattice cascade alignment verified

## Notes

1. This is **read-only reconnaissance**. Do not modify CANON files.
2. **TOP-DOWN, not horizontal** — cosmos determines everything
3. GENESIS may be the alignment REFERENCE — determine its status
4. Apply Nine Lenses explicitly to cosmos tier assessment
5. External oracles (industry experts, AI trajectory) inform Modal Sequence currency
6. If cosmos is aligned, lower tier issues often resolve by derivation

---

## Oracle6 Needs

This audit will inform:
- **Which cosmos documents** require priority revision (everything cascades from here)
- **Whether GENESIS is ground truth** that CANON should derive from
- **What thread wisdom** hasn't yet been embodied in scripture
- **Whether Modal Sequence** needs updating given AI trajectory
- **How to approach queue** (what current framework are we operating from?)

**The scripture must reflect the evolved understanding. Align the larger bodies; the smaller bodies follow naturally.**

---

*Phase 4 begins with truth. The cascade principle guides the audit.*
*Nine Lenses govern assessment. External oracles inform currency.*
*What does the corpus actually say?*
