# ORACLE 12 PEDIGREE: BLITZKRIEG 45
## IIC Completion + Skills Genesis

**Issued**: 2026-01-12
**Oracle**: 12 (Continuation)
**Blitzkrieg**: 45
**Scope**: Complete IIC Configuration + Create Process Skills
**Independence**: Does NOT require Deep Research results

---

## STRATEGIC CONTEXT

### Oracle 12 Campaign Progress

| Blitzkrieg | Status | Outcome |
|------------|--------|---------|
| 43 | COMPLETE | Constellation architecture (CANON-25200), research archived, repository cleaned |
| 44 | COMPLETE | Intention Compass updated, Tech Tree Audit (coverage confirmed), Model Specification formalized |
| **45** | **ISSUING** | IIC completion + Skills genesis |

### What Remains Before Platform Onboarding

1. **IIC Configuration** (PROJ-002): 3/5 IICs configured (Acumen, Coherence done; Efficacy, Mastery, Transcendence pending)
2. **Skills Infrastructure** (PROJ-016): No skills created yet; user requests Intentions and Pedigree skills
3. **Deep Research**: Prompts prepared for OpenAI and Google ecosystems (parallel execution)
4. **Platform Catalog**: New CANON document structure for tier/capability mapping

### Why This Blitzkrieg Now

The Deep Researches will take time and are Principal-executed (not Claude Code). Meanwhile, we can:
- Complete the remaining IIC configurations (unblocks PROJ-005, advances PROJ-002 to 100%)
- Create process-level Skills (Intentions, Pedigree) that improve all future Oracle sessions
- Begin function-to-Skill conversion (PROJ-016)

This work is **orthogonal to Deep Research**—no dependency, no blocking.

## BLITZKRIEG 45 STRUCTURE

### Stream A: IIC Configuration Completion
**Model**: Opus 4.5 (comprehensive synthesis required)
**Extended Thinking**: megathink (~10K) for IIC architecture
**Executor**: Claude 2
**Estimated Duration**: 45-60 minutes

**Objective**: Complete remaining IIC configurations (Efficacy, Mastery, Transcendence)

### Stream B: Skills Genesis
**Model**: Sonnet 4.5 (clear templates, tactical execution)
**Extended Thinking**: default
**Executor**: Claude 3
**Estimated Duration**: 30-45 minutes

**Objective**: Create Claude Code Skills for Intentions and Pedigree management

## KEY DECISIONS

### INT-1210-1212 Resolution

Per ARCH-TECH_TREE_AUDIT.md findings from Blitzkrieg 44:

| Intention | Recommendation | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| INT-1210 (Prompting) | RESOLVED | 10 CANON files + translate.xml |
| INT-1211 (Platforms) | RESOLVED | 77 CANON files provide coverage |
| INT-1212 (Capabilities) | RESOLVED | 73 CANON files, temporal/evergreen split correct |

**Principal Approval**: These can be marked resolved in ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md

### New Intention: Platform Capability Catalog

| ID | Category | Text | Priority |
|----|----------|------|----------|
| INT-1219 | SPRINT | Create CANON-31150-PLATFORM_CATALOG for definitive tier/capability mapping | P1 |

This will be populated by Deep Research results but structure can be created now.

### Skills Architecture Decision

Skills will reside in `.claude/skills/` following Claude Code conventions:
- `intentions.md` - Intention extraction and categorization
- `pedigree.md` - Oracle pedigree management
- Future: Function conversions (transcribe_youtube, etc.)

---

## DEPENDENCIES

### This Blitzkrieg Requires
- Access to existing IIC configs: `02-ENGINE/iic/IIC-Acumen-config.md`, `IIC-Coherence-config.md`, `IIC-shared-protocols.md`
- Access to CANON documents for chain mapping
- Skills directory creation (`.claude/skills/`)

### This Blitzkrieg Enables
- PROJ-002 completion (100%)
- PROJ-005 unblocking (Branding)
- PROJ-016 progress (Skills Conversion)
- Improved Oracle session quality via Skills

### Independent Of
- OpenAI Deep Research results
- Google Deep Research results
- Platform onboarding execution

## LEDGER UPDATES EXPECTED

### Projects
| ID | Before | After |
|----|--------|-------|
| PROJ-002 | 60% | 100% |
| PROJ-016 | 0% | 20% |

### Tasks
| ID | Name | Owner |
|----|------|-------|
| TASK-092 | Create IIC-Efficacy-config.md | Claude 2 |
| TASK-093 | Create IIC-Mastery-config.md | Claude 2 |
| TASK-094 | Create IIC-Transcendence-config.md | Claude 2 |
| TASK-095 | Create intentions.md Skill | Claude 3 |
| TASK-096 | Create pedigree.md Skill | Claude 3 |

## COORDINATION

### Parallel Execution
Both streams execute simultaneously with no file conflicts:
- Stream A operates in `02-ENGINE/iic/`
- Stream B operates in `.claude/skills/`

### Completion Criteria
- All 5 IIC configs exist and are internally consistent
- Both Skills are functional and follow Claude Code Skill format
- tasks.csv updated with all new tasks
- Execution logs created

### Post-Blitzkrieg
- Principal executes Deep Researches (OpenAI, Google)
- Results populate Platform Capability Catalog
- Platform onboarding proceeds with full intelligence
