# DIRECTIVE-020: PHASE 2 COMPLETION — STREAM ALPHA
## Archive Finalization + Tech Lunar Canonization
**Issued**: 2025-12-30
**Authority**: Sovereign
**Classification**: HIGH — Phase 2 Completion
**Execution**: Claude 2 Code Desktop
**Status**: EXECUTED

---

## CONTEXT

DIRECTIVE-019 restored orchestration infrastructure. Phase 1 (Structural) is 95% complete. This directive completes Phase 2 (Execution) Track A and Track B.

**Visibility Protocol**: All outputs must follow the restored protocol:
1. Save execution report to `orchestration/execution_logs/`
2. Update `orchestration/state/CURRENT_STATE.md`
3. Update `orchestration/state/BACKLOG.md`
4. Archive this directive to `orchestration/directives/`

## TRACK A: ARCHIVE FINALIZATION

### Status: ALREADY COMPLETE (Prior Session)

ARCHIVE/ directory exists with:
- ARCHIVE-COGNITIVE-PALACE-SPECS.md (35K)
- ARCHIVE-ARTIFACT-SYSTEM.md (8K)
- README.md (3K)

Total: ~43K (under 50K target) — compression goals exceeded.
