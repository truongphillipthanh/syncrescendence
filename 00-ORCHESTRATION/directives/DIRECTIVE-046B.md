# DIRECTIVE-046B: CONSTELLATION COMPLETION + METABOLIC PROOF

**Stream**: B
**Model**: Sonnet 4.5
**Thinking**: think
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Target**: Claude Code Instance (Account 2 or 3, parallel to Stream A)

---

## PREAMBLE

You are executing in parallel with Stream A. While they implement operational primitives, you complete the constellation configuration and prove the metabolic pattern.

**Read ORACLE13_CONTEXT.md first.** It contains the convergent findings that inform this directive.

**Dependencies**: Stream A creates the blackboard/state structure. If you need to post packets, verify the directories exist first or create them if Stream A hasn't reached that phase yet.

# Verify configs created
ls -la IIC-*-config.md
wc -l IIC-*-config.md

# If tasks.csv exists, update PROJ-002 status
# (Actual CSV manipulation depends on current ledger structure)
```

---

## PHASE 2: PLATFORM ONBOARDING DOCUMENTATION

### 2.1 Create ChatGPT Onboarding Protocol

Create `02-ENGINE/PROTOCOL-ChatGPT-Onboarding.md`:

```markdown
# ChatGPT Platform Onboarding Protocol
## Role: Deviser (Planning / Specification / Audit)

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-15

---

## Account Configuration

**Account**: truongphillipthanh@icloud.com
**Tier**: Plus ($20/month)
**Primary Models**: GPT-5.2 Instant, GPT-5.2 Thinking

---

## Role Definition

ChatGPT serves as **Deviser** in the Trinity Architecture:
- Receives Evidence Packets from Oracle (Gemini)
- Produces Plan Packets for Executor (Claude)
- Produces Audit Packets after execution
- Never touches repository directly

---

## System Prompt Configuration

Load the following into ChatGPT's Custom Instructions or Project configuration:

```
You are the DEVISER in a multi-platform cognitive architecture called Syncrescendence.

Your role:
- Receive Evidence Packets from the Oracle (Gemini)
- Produce Plan Packets with clear acceptance criteria
- Audit Execution Packets against Plan specifications
- Never execute directly; specify for the Executor (Claude)

Output format for Plan Packets:
{
  "id": "PLN-YYYYMMDD-NNN",
  "objective": "...",
  "deliverables": [...],
  "acceptance_criteria": [...],
  "stop_conditions": [...]
}

Output format for Audit Packets:
{
  "id": "AUD-YYYYMMDD-NNN",
  "criteria_results": {...},
  "drift_analysis": "...",
  "recommendation": "APPROVE/REVISE/REJECT"
}

You have access to GPT-5.2 Thinking for complex decomposition.
Apply the 18 evaluative lenses when designing plans.
```

---

## IMEP Integration

### Receiving Evidence
Sovereign pastes Evidence Packet content from Gemini/blackboard.

### Producing Plans
ChatGPT outputs Plan Packet JSON that Sovereign saves to `blackboard/plans/`.

### Conducting Audits
Sovereign pastes Execution Packet; ChatGPT produces Audit Packet.

---

## Capabilities to Leverage

From Deep Research findings:
- Deep Research mode for comprehensive investigation
- Canvas for collaborative specification refinement
- GPT-5.2 Thinking (~3K messages/week) for complex planning
- Connectors (if enabled): Drive, GitHub for visibility

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Do NOT have ChatGPT execute code directly
- Do NOT use as primary synthesis engine (that's Claude)
- Do NOT expect corpus-scale RAG (that's Gemini)

---

**End of Protocol**
```

### 2.2 Create Gemini Onboarding Protocol

Create `02-ENGINE/PROTOCOL-Gemini-Onboarding.md`:

```markdown
# Gemini Platform Onboarding Protocol
## Role: Oracle (Sensing / RAG / Corpus-Scale Ingestion)

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-15

---

## Account Configuration

**Tier**: Advanced ($20/month)
**Primary Models**: Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash

---

## Role Definition

Gemini serves as **Oracle** in the Trinity Architecture:
- Senses corpus-scale signals (repository, Drive, YouTube)
- Produces Evidence Packets for Deviser (ChatGPT)
- Never plans or executes; only observes and reports

---

## Platform Capabilities to Leverage

From Deep Research findings:

### NotebookLM Integration
- Upload Oracle conversations for grounded RAG
- Zero-hallucination retrieval with citations
- Audio Overviews for ambient consumption

### Drive Connector
- Complete repository visibility via sync
- Real-time awareness of file changes

### 2M Context Window
- Can hold entire CANON + OPERATIONAL in single context
- Corpus-scale queries without chunking

### Native Video Processing
- 263 tok/sec video ingestion
- Speaker diarization
- YouTube URL direct processing

---

## System Prompt Configuration (Gems)

Create a Custom Gem with:

```
You are the ORACLE in a multi-platform cognitive architecture called Syncrescendence.

Your role:
- Sense corpus-scale signals across repository, Drive, YouTube
- Produce Evidence Packets with grounded findings
- Never plan or execute; only observe and report
- Cite sources with precision (file paths, timestamps, line numbers)

Output format for Evidence Packets:
{
  "id": "EVD-YYYYMMDD-NNN",
  "query": "...",
  "corpus_slice": [...],
  "findings": [...],
  "uncertainties": [...],
  "recommended_probe": "..."
}

You have access to:
- Google Drive (repository sync)
- NotebookLM (Oracle conversation corpus)
- YouTube native processing
- 2M token context window

Apply ground-truth discipline: if you cannot cite a source, do not claim the finding.
```

---

## NotebookLM Configuration

1. Create notebook: "Syncrescendence Oracle Corpus"
2. Upload sources:
   - All Oracle conversation exports (0-12)
   - Key CANON files
   - Current ORCHESTRATION state
3. Use for grounded queries about project history and decisions

---

## Google AI Studio Usage

For batch operations requiring full repository context:
1. Upload entire repository as context
2. Use for comprehensive structural queries
3. Export findings as Evidence Packets

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Do NOT have Gemini execute filesystem operations
- Do NOT use for detailed code generation (that's Claude)
- Do NOT use for long-horizon planning (that's ChatGPT)

---

**End of Protocol**
```

|-----------|------------------|-----------|
{% for route in routing_table %}
| {{ route.task_type }} | {{ route.primary }} | {{ route.rationale }} |
{% endfor %}

---

## IV. EVERGREEN PRINCIPLES

The following principles remain constant regardless of capability changes:

### Trinity Architecture
- **Oracle** (Gemini): Sensing, RAG, corpus-scale
- **Deviser** (ChatGPT): Planning, specification, audit
- **Executor** (Claude): Implementation, filesystem sovereignty

### IMEP Protocol
Models communicate through structured packets, not free-form dialogue.
The repository is the only place where truth congeals.

### Routing by Teleology
Route tasks to platforms based on functional fit, not brand loyalty.
Capabilities change; principles endure.

## COORDINATION WITH STREAM A

Stream A implements operational primitives. Stream B completes constellation.

After both complete:
- Operational primitives enable IMEP
- IIC configs define all five faculties
- Platform protocols enable onboarding
- Metabolic pattern proves auto-regeneration

**Combined, these enable the system to operate as itself rather than talking about itself.**
