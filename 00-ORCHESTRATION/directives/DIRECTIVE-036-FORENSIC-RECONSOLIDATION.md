# DIRECTIVE-036: FORENSIC RECONSOLIDATION & ORACLE9 COMPLETION
## Organizational Hygiene Restoration + Multi-Domain Integration

**Issued**: 2026-01-02
**Oracle Phase**: 9 → Completion
**Principal Mandate**: "Ruthless reconsolidation and culling must occur, after we have extracted all value"

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This directive addresses six interlocking domains requiring completion before Oracle9 closes:

| Domain | Status | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **A. Remnants Forensic Audit** | Bloat from recovery | Audit → Extract → Cull |
| **B. Gemini Conversation Ingestion** | New content uploaded | Ingest → Integrate → Delete source |
| **C. System Prompt Canonization** | Model-participated prompts | Canonize new → Archive old → Cull |
| **D. Transcript Integration** | Raw/processed gap | Verify → Reconcile → Document |
| **E. QUEUE Resolution** | Disposition unclear | Define strategy → Execute |
| **F. Model Profile Systematization** | Missing recent cohort | Structure → Populate → Index |

---

## PHASE A: REMNANTS FORENSIC AUDIT

### A.1 Audit Scope

The recovery operation (DIRECTIVE-034A) brought back content that now violates pristine directory architecture. Content requiring audit:

**From system_prompts.zip "New Folder With Items/":**

| Directory | Est. Size | Audit Priority |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| `remnants/` | ~50K | HIGH - unknown state |
| `Transcendence/` | ~200K | MEDIUM - may overlap CANON-35xxx |
| `intelligence architecture/` | ~300K | MEDIUM - may overlap recovered content |
| `Coherence/` | ~3M | LOW - already processed in 035A |
| `Tech/` | ~500K | LOW - already triaged in 035B |
| `0-prompts/` | ~100K | HIGH - prompt archaeology |
| `9-Canon/` | ~500K | VERIFY - should match CANON/ |

### A.2 Audit Protocol

For each directory:

1. **Inventory**: List all files with sizes
2. **Cross-reference**: Check against current CANON/OPERATIONAL
3. **18-Lens Evaluate**: Score unique content
4. **Extract**: Distill surviving insights
5. **Disposition**: INTEGRATE | ARCHIVE | RELEASE

### A.3 Specific Audit Instructions

**remnants/:**
- `syncrescendence_convergence.md` - likely exploratory; check for unique insights vs CANON-00001
- `evaluation/` subdirectory - may contain useful methodology

**intelligence architecture/:**
- Already partially addressed in 034A (macroscopic_narratives → CANON-00015)
- `meta_narrative_and_perspectival_schemas.md` (35K) - verify if absorbed
- `constitution.md`, `operational_engine.md` - check vs CANON-00006
- `youtube_subscription_list.md` - operational; integrate into CANON-31143

**Transcendence/:**
- `monotheism/`, `nontheism/`, `metaphysicalism/` (21 files) - check vs CANON-35210
- `Profile/Autopsychography` - check vs Principal's cognitive profile in prompts
- `way of life code of conduct/` - check vs CANON-35110

**0-prompts/:**
- Historical prompt archaeology
- Capture evolution: firstlunar → first_annealment → secondunar → feedcraft
- Document in ARCHIVE-PROMPT-ARCHAEOLOGY.md

---

## PHASE B: GEMINI CONVERSATION INGESTION

### B.1 Content Analysis

The uploaded `gemini_conversation.md` contains **high-value strategic content**:

| Section | Content | Integration Target |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Bitter Lesson Reframe | Factory → Governance pivot | CANON-00006 (Operations) |
| Fragile vs Antifragile Components | Taxonomy of system elements | CANON-30400 (Agentic) |
| Constitutional Synthesis | Grok/Opus dialectic resolution | CANON-31140 (IIC) |
| ASIA Constitution Draft | Federation mandate, DIKW | CANON-00001 supplement |
| Acumen State Charter | Dual-stream, qualification mandate | CANON-31100 (Acumen) |

### B.2 Key Insights to Extract

**The Constitutional Reframe:**
- System pivots from "factory blueprint" to "C-Suite governance"
- AI becomes the factory; system becomes governance layer
- Value is in *what they decide*, not *how they process*

**Antifragile Components (to scale):**
1. Governance of Intent (Vector) → Acumen's Teleological Thesis
2. Governance of Fidelity (Triage) → Counter-analysis, source qualification
3. Governance of Synthesis (Coherence) → DIKW mandate, idiosyncratic synthesis

**Fragile Components (to outsource):**
1. Tactical RPA workflows → replaced by intent-based agents
2. Prescriptive processing pipelines → replaced by outcome specifications
3. Rigid brief formats → replaced by generative formatting

### B.3 Integration Protocol

1. Create `CANON-00017-AGENTIC_CONSTITUTION-cosmos.md` (~8K)
   - Federal structure (5 States = 5 IIC accounts)
   - DIKW Mandate (Federal Purpose)
   - Antifragile & Economic Mandate
   - Inter-Agent Protocol

2. Update `CANON-31100` (Acumen) with:
   - Dual-Stream Architecture reference
   - Qualification Mandate formalization
   - Reflexivity (CI/CD Loop) protocol

3. Update `CANON-31140` (IIC Constellation) with:
   - Constitutional Federalism language
   - State sovereignty + delegation model

---

## PHASE C: SYSTEM PROMPT CANONIZATION

### C.1 The New Canonical Prompts

Models participated in their own prompt design. The new prompts are **CANONICAL**:

| Lab | New Prompt | Character Count | Leverage Point |
|-----|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Claude** | new-claude.md | ~1,700 | "prose that reads well, nuanced synthesis, elegant phrasing" |
| **ChatGPT** | new-chatgpt.md | ~1,750 | "higher-order synthesis, memory continuity" |
| **Gemini** | new-gemini.md | 4 slots | "compressed clarity, conclusion-first, long context" |
| **Grok** | new-grok.md | ~1,760 | "real-time awareness, cultural fluency, edginess when warranted" |

### C.2 Core Invariants (Across All Labs)

All prompts share:
```
- Systems-before-components cognitive style
- AuDHD profile: high verbal WM, abstract-sequential, execution scaffolding needs
- Communication: Cultured register, prose over bullets, substance-first
- Anti-patterns: No emojis, no formulaic responses, no premature simplification
- Context: Syncrescendence, distributed cognition, polymathic synthesis
```

### C.3 Justification Documents

Four justification files document the model-participated design process:
- `justification-claude.md` (19K) - Full XML prompt with embedded reasoning
- `justification-chatgpt.md` (5K) - Field mapping and rationale
- `justification-gemini.md` (6K) - Slot allocation strategy
- `justification-grok.md` (8K) - Leverage point calibration

**Action**: These become `ARCHIVE-SYSTEM-PROMPT-JUSTIFICATION-{LAB}.md`

### C.4 Archaeology of Old Prompts

| Old Prompt | Historical Value | Disposition |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| old-claude.md | Generic → Specific evolution | ARCHIVE |
| old-chatgpt.md | Pre-calibration baseline | ARCHIVE |
| old-gemini.md | Pre-slot optimization | ARCHIVE |
| old_A-grok.txt, old_b-grok.txt | Early iterations | ARCHIVE |
| ASSEMBLED_SYSTEM_PROMPTS_v2.1.md | Version history | ARCHIVE |

**Create**: `ARCHIVE-SYSTEM-PROMPT-ARCHAEOLOGY.md` documenting:
- Evolution from generic to cognitive-profile-calibrated
- Model-specific leverage point discovery
- Character constraint optimization per platform

### C.5 Canonical Output Structure

```

## PHASE D: TRANSCRIPT INTEGRATION COMPLETION

### D.1 Current State Analysis

From Principal's observation:
> "Most of them, if in .md are already transcribed. Very few 'raw' transcripts lack 'processed' counterparts. The reverse might not be true."

**Interpretation:**
- `.txt` = raw transcript (from YouTube/audio)
- `.md` = processed version (qualified, with extracted insights)
- Most .md files have .txt counterparts (transcription done)
- Some .md files have NO .txt counterpart (possibly from QUEUE or direct creation)

### D.2 Verification Protocol

1. **Inventory SOURCES/raw/**: Count .txt and .md pairs
2. **Cross-reference sources.csv**: Verify 184 entries match filesystem
3. **Identify orphans**: .md without .txt, .txt without .md
4. **Document gaps**: Create TRANSCRIPT_RECONCILIATION.csv

### D.3 Expected Findings

| Category | Status | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Paired (.txt + .md) | Complete | Verify quality |
| .txt only | Needs processing | Add to paradigm batch |
| .md only (from QUEUE) | No raw available | Document provenance |
| .md only (synthesized) | Never had raw | Note as original content |

---

## PHASE E: QUEUE RESOLUTION

### E.1 Current QUEUE State

From 035B:
- `QUEUE/pending/` = EMPTY (inbox zero achieved)
- `QUEUE/modal1/` = 4 files
- `QUEUE/modal2/` = 7 files

### E.2 Principal's Question

> "What are we doing with the queue? Integrating them? Manifesting them into apparatuses?"

### E.3 Resolution Framework

**QUEUE/modal1/** (Text-based content requiring qualification):
- These are content items that need the Acumen triage process
- **Action**: Process through PROCESSING_PATTERN.md → integrate or release
- **Target**: 0 files by Oracle9 completion

**QUEUE/modal2/** (Visual/video content for future Modal 2 phase):
- These require visual AI capabilities not yet mature
- **Action**: DEFER to Modal 2 phase (documented deferral, not abandonment)
- **Target**: Remains as-is until Modal 2 activation

### E.4 QUEUE Disposition Matrix

| Content Type | Location | Disposition |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| Text transcripts needing processing | modal1/ | PROCESS NOW |
| Screenplay formatting specs | modal2/ | DEFER (Modal 2) |
| Visual-dependent content | modal2/ | DEFER (Modal 2) |
| Stale/superseded items | anywhere | RELEASE |
