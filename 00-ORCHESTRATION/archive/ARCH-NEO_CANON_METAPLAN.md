## 0. Preamble: The Generation-Skip

The old canon (CANON-00000 through CANON-35999, 160+ files) grew by accretion over 23 sessions. It carries prescient insights embedded in vestigial structure. The neo-canon is its spiritual successor — not a migration but a generation-skip, following the pattern that produced Rust from C, TypeScript from JavaScript, Swift from Objective-C.

**The compiler metaphor is structural, not decorative.** In a generation-skip language:
- The **type system** enforces correctness that the old language left to the developer's brain
- The **garbage collector** prunes what the old language accumulated without bound
- The **borrow checker** (Rust) or **type checker** (TypeScript) catches errors at compile time that the old language caught at runtime — or never

Applied to the canon:
- **Old canon = C**: Power and depth. Manual addressing (CANON-30300 = meaningless number). No structural coherence guarantees. Reader bears all interpretive burden.
- **Neo-canon = Rust**: Every concept has a semantic address derived from its position in the nucleic core. Structure enforces coherence. Vestigial concepts fail the core derivation test automatically. The burden of correctness moves from the reader's brain to the architecture.

**The nucleic core IS the compiler.** It defines:
- The type system (Entity Taxonomy)
- The grammar (Governed Verbs + State Machines)
- The garbage collection (Heritage Principle — vestigial concepts pruned by failing core derivation)
- The safety guarantees (Sovereignty Invariant, Schema Sovereignty)
- The activation checker (Anti-Shelfware — every concept must have a path to execution)

## 1. Axiom Clarescence

### Method

Seven candidate axioms were extracted from Session 21's annealment trilogy. Each was evaluated against evidence from three master digests (~1,200 lines total): ARCH-GRAND_ANNEALMENT.md, CLARESCE-MASTER-DIGEST.md, RUNLOGS-MASTER-DIGEST.md.

**Axiom test**: An axiom is irreducible if it cannot be derived from the other candidates. If it CAN be derived, it is a theorem — operationally load-bearing but structurally dependent.

### Verdict: 4 Axioms + 3 Theorems

#### TRUE AXIOMS (irreducible primitives)

**A1. COHERENCE AS SCARCE RESOURCE** (the telos)

The personal ontology targets remaining-oneself under persuasion, overload, and fragmentation — not efficiency. Coherence is the scarce resource, not compute or storage. This distinction governs every design decision.

*Evidence*: Explicit telos distinction from enterprise Palantir (Grand Annealment §3). The 86% deferred commitment loss rate is a coherence measurement (Runlogs L14). Claresce3v2 scored 6.3/10 with T1a↔T2 chain at 1/174 linked items — coherence quantified and found failing (Clarescence §1). The system is "intellectually complete and operationally empty" — a coherence gap, not an intelligence gap.

*Irreducibility test*: Cannot be derived from Capacity, Sovereignty, or Pipeline alone. It is the WHY — the reason the system exists. Without this axiom, you could build a perfectly sovereign, high-capacity pipeline that produces incoherent output. PASSES.

**A2. CAPACITY BEFORE INTELLIGENCE** (the binding constraint)

The Sovereign's constraint is capacity (energy, bandwidth, activation), not intelligence. Every major decision has been correct; the gap is exclusively between decision and activation. Systems must route around this constraint, not assume it away.

*Evidence*: Grand Synthesis terminal statement: "This is a Capacity constraint, not an Intelligence constraint." Kill test 1 failure (6 min, zero recovery) — infrastructure, not reasoning. 42% delivery rate despite correct architecture. Sophistication Plateau: architecturally mature at 40% operational capacity.

*Irreducibility test*: Independent of Coherence — a system can have coherence problems without capacity problems (small system, clear vision, no energy to execute) or capacity problems without coherence problems (high energy, fragmented direction). PASSES.

**A3. SOVEREIGNTY INVARIANT** (the ground truth principle)

The repo is ground truth; all other surfaces are cache. Semantic authority must live outside any single app — deleting an app must not delete meaning. When state conflicts between a platform and the repo, the repo wins.

*Evidence*: CLAUDE.md Constitutional Rule 5. Delete-the-app test (Grand Annealment §3). DEC-SOV-019: zero cloud services. DEC-SOV-009: self-improvement constitutionalized as irreversible. CARDINAL RULE: never ask Sovereign to do what you can dispatch. Neural Bridge as physical instantiation of sovereignty across machines.

*Irreducibility test*: Independent of Coherence and Capacity — a system can be sovereign but incoherent, or coherent but captured by external schemas. PASSES.

**A4. INTENT-ARTIFACT PIPELINE** (the value chain)

Value only crystallizes when intent traverses the full chain: capture → distill → model → activate → verify. Any break in this chain = shelfware. The pipeline operates at every scale: civilizational (10-stage Causal Chain), business (Catalyst Packet), operational (Receipts invariant), and session (Hard-Gate skills).

*Evidence*: 10-stage Causal Chain from Conceptual Architecture to Civilizational Infrastructure. Catalyst Packet unit: Claim + Micro-demo + Artifact + Invitation. Constitutional Rule 3: "No completion claim without artifacts committed to the repository." 42% delivery rate is the pipeline's direct health measurement. 0% hard-gate skill activation rate as of Feb 15.

*Irreducibility test*: Not derivable from the other three. Coherence says WHAT to protect. Capacity says WHAT constrains. Sovereignty says WHERE truth lives. Pipeline says HOW value moves. PASSES.

#### THEOREMS (derived, operationally load-bearing)

**T1. ATTENTION BOTTLENECK (σ₀)** — derived from A1 + A2

Attention is the intersection of coherence and capacity. When coherence degrades under capacity constraint, the mechanism is attention exhaustion. σ₀ (Sovereign Attention) is the top stratum because all other strata ultimately serve it.

*Derivation*: A1 (coherence is scarce) + A2 (capacity, not intelligence, is the constraint) → the specific capacity that degrades coherence is attention. The "near-zero activation energy" pattern, the 86% deferred commitment loss, the CARDINAL RULE violations — all are attention misallocation under capacity constraint.

*Operational status*: LOAD-BEARING. The σ₀–σ₇ stack is organized around this theorem. The Hook maturity ladder (Instruction → Skill → Hook) exists to compensate for it. Not an axiom, but a theorem that generates architecture.

**T2. ANTI-SHELFWARE** — derived from A2 + A4

Accumulated capability without activation energy is zero. Shelfware is the failure mode of the Intent-Artifact Pipeline under Capacity constraint. Systems must be designed for activation, not accumulation.

*Derivation*: A2 (capacity constrains) + A4 (value requires pipeline completion) → when capacity is insufficient to complete the pipeline, artifacts accumulate without activation. The 42% delivery rate, the "intellectually complete, operationally empty" diagnosis, the 0% hard-gate delivery rate — all are A2 constraining A4.

*Operational status*: LOAD-BEARING. The Instruction → Skill → Hook ladder, the Kill Criteria, the Maturity Gates — all are anti-shelfware mechanisms. Generates the design constraint that every neo-canon concept must have an explicit activation path.

**T3. SCHEMA SOVEREIGNTY** — derived from A3 specialized to type systems

Only the Sovereign defines or modifies the canonical entity taxonomy. An actor controlling object type definitions controls the Sovereign's operational reality. Schema capture is ontological capture — a distinct security threat separate from credential theft.

*Derivation*: A3 (sovereignty invariant) applied to the specific domain of entity type definitions → whoever controls the schema controls operational reality.

*Operational status*: LOAD-BEARING. The Directionality Test, the SecurityBoundary entity type, DEC-SOV-019 (zero cloud services) — all enforce this theorem. Generates the security architecture of the neo-canon.

### Axiom Dependency Graph

```
A1 (Coherence)  A2 (Capacity)  A3 (Sovereignty)  A4 (Pipeline)
      \              |    \           |                /
       \             |     \          |               /
        → T1 (σ₀) ←─┘      → T3 (Schema) ←────────┘
              |
        A2 ───→ T2 (Anti-Shelfware) ←── A4
```

All four axioms are co-equal and irreducible. The three theorems are derived but operationally mandatory — they generate specific architecture.

## 2. Nucleic Core Design

### 2.1 Telos (the terminal condition)

**A sovereign human operating at civilizational scale, with coherence intact.**

Unpacked:
- **Sovereign**: ground truth resides with the individual, not any platform, institution, or model (A3)
- **Human**: biological, capacity-constrained, attention-bottlenecked (A2, T1)
- **Civilizational scale**: the 10-stage Causal Chain from Conceptual Architecture to Civilizational Infrastructure, realized as Gaian Field Nodes (A4)
- **Coherence intact**: remaining oneself under persuasion, overload, and fragmentation (A1)

The **Personal Palantir** is the architectural form of this telos. It is not an app — it is the semantic backbone that makes sovereignty technically enforceable at scale.

### 2.2 Entity Taxonomy (the type system)

The neo-canon type system has three tiers, validated by 4/4 model consensus and refined through 8 patches.

**Tier 1 — Invariants** (structural load-bearing; deletion requires Sovereign override)

| Entity Type | Definition | State Machine |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| Commitment | A promise with lifecycle | proposed → active → fulfilled → renegotiated → dissolved |
| Capacity | Throttleable, depletable operational resource | available → allocated → depleted → recovering |
| Risk | Identified constraint or threat | identified → assessed → mitigated → accepted → materialized |
| Constraint | Hard boundary on action space | active → suspended → retired |
| Identity Facet | Sovereign self-representation in context | latent → active → primary → archived |
| Relationship | First-class typed link between entities | proposed → active → strained → dissolved |
| Resource | Durable asset with lifecycle | acquired → deployed → maintaining → retired |

**Tier 2 — Operational** (working objects; creation/deletion at agent discretion within policy)

| Entity Type | Definition |
|-------------|-----------|
| Project | Bounded scope with terminal condition |
| Agent | Autonomous executor within governed constraints |
| Tool | Capability-extending instrument with maturity state |
| Source | Provenance-tagged information artifact |
| Pattern | Reusable solution template with activation path |
| Context | Environmental state affecting all operations |

**Tier 3 — Architecturally Significant** (emergent from operational experience)

| Entity Type | Definition |
|-------------|-----------|
| Memory | Versioned state with provenance and time-travel |
| Policy / Rule | Legislature of the personal constitutional democracy |
| Health State | Biological first-class object; glucose-aware throttling |
| BudgetEnvelope | Resource allocation boundary |
| SecurityBoundary | Schema sovereignty enforcement perimeter |
| CaptureQueue | Inbound signal buffer awaiting triage |

**Governed Verbs** (the Kinetic layer — what can change)

Seven canonical verbs define the action space:

| Verb | Domain | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| Commit | Commitment | Create or strengthen a binding promise |
| Decline | Commitment | Refuse without creating obligation |
| Delegate | Agency | Transfer execution authority, retain accountability |
| Renegotiate | Commitment | Modify terms while preserving relationship |
| Escalate | Sovereignty | Elevate decision to higher authority level |
| Suspend | Any | Pause without dissolving — preserves state |
| Transition | Any | Move entity to next state in its machine |

**The type system enforces correctness**: a Commitment cannot be Delegated (only its execution can be). A Risk cannot be Committed to (only its mitigation can be). These constraints are compile-time — the architecture rejects invalid operations.

### 2.3 Processing Architecture (the runtime)

**Cognitive Palace** — 7 simultaneous layers (not sequential):

| Layer | Name | Domain | Neo-Canon Ring |
|-------|------|--------|----------------|
| 0 | Reality | Ontological bedrock | SELF |
| 1 | Imaginalia | Teleological attraction | SELF |
| 2 | Potentiality | Resource domains | AGENCY |
| 3 | Temporality | Rhythmic harmonics | AGENCY |
| 4 | Practicality | Operational categories | WORK |
| 5 | Actuality | Eternal present nexus | WORK |
| 6 | Consequentiality | Wisdom accumulation | COMMUNITY |
| σ | Transcendence Ring | Strategic Harmony | WORLD |

**Modal Sequence** (civilizational time backbone):
- Modal 1 Abstraction (LLMs): 2024–27, ~85% mature ← CURRENT
- Modal 2 Simulation (world models): 2027–30, ~40% mature
- Modal 3 Embodiment (physical AI): 2031–36, ~15% mature
- Modal 4 Transcendence: 2037+, ~5% mature

**Six Causal Chains** with hard dependencies:
- ALL chains require Intelligence Stage 1
- Expertise Stage 2+ requires Information Stage 2
- Knowledge Stage 2+ requires Insight Stage 2
- Wisdom Stage 2+ requires ALL chains at Stage 2 + Insight Stage 3
- Any Stage 4 (teaching) requires Wisdom Stage 2+
- Constructive interference ≈ 200% amplification; destructive = burnout

**Five Hard-Gate Skills** (DEC-C3 — the runtime's safety checks):
INBOUND → ORIENT → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → CLOSE

**Three-Layer Autonomic Dispatch** (the runtime's heartbeat):
- Layer 1 (spinal cord): auto_ingest_loop.sh — 30s poll
- Layer 2 (brainstem): watchdog — 60s health monitoring
- Layer 3 (prefrontal): proactive_orchestrator — 300s work generation [CURRENTLY NON-FUNCTIONAL]

### 2.4 Deployment Target (the platform)

**Personal Palantir — Four Constitutive Layers**:

```
SEMANTIC   → What exists: typed entities, properties, relationships
KINETIC    → What can change: governed verbs, state transitions
DYNAMIC    → Who can do what: permissions, governance, policy
PHYSICS    → What emerges: computed properties, simulations, predictions [FUTURE]
```

**Sovereign Stack (σ₀–σ₇)** — mapped to cosmological rings:

| Stratum | Name | Ring | Status |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| σ₀ | Philosopher's Stone | SELF | Implicit (identity/values) |
| σ₁ | Sensemaking | SELF | Active (clarescence) |
| σ₂ | Semantic Core | SELF→AGENCY | **THE UNBUILT GAP** |
| σ₃ | Corpus | AGENCY | Active (CANON/ENGINE/SIGMA) |
| σ₄ | Integration | AGENCY→WORK | Active (MCP, APIs) |
| σ₅ | Agency | WORK | Active (Constellation) |
| σ₆ | Access | COMMUNITY | Partial (DC-003 open) |
| σ₇ | Sensing | WORLD | Active (hooks, feedcraft) |

**σ₇-First Principle**: Engineering priority flows outside-in. Build sensing before sensemaking. σ₂ is the critical gap — without it, agents act but cannot act within governed semantic constraints.

### 2.5 Core Derivation Test

The nucleic core is self-sufficient if and only if:

**Test 1 — Forward derivation**: Can you derive a new concept from the four axioms + type system without referring to any old-canon document?
- Example: "Session Recovery Protocol" → derives from A1 (coherence must survive session boundaries) + A2 (capacity constrains session length) + T2 (recovery must activate, not shelf) → RING: AGENCY, TYPE: Pattern, VERBS: Suspend/Transition. **PASS** — no old-canon reference needed.

**Test 2 — Vestigial pruning**: Does a vestigial concept fail the derivation test automatically?
- Example: "CANON-30300" (a number with no semantic content) → cannot derive from any axiom or ring → has no type, no state machine, no governed verb → **PRUNED**. The addressing system itself is vestigial.

**Test 3 — Coherence enforcement**: Does the architecture catch incoherent additions?
- Example: Adding "Social Media Scheduling" as a Tier 1 entity → Tier 1 requires structural load-bearing status and Sovereign override for deletion → social media scheduling is neither invariant nor identity-level → **REJECTED** at compile time. Belongs in Tier 2 (Tool) at most.

All three tests pass. The core is deep enough to proceed.

## 3. Cosmological Ring Structure (the addressing system)

### The Five Rings

Old canon was domain-organized (content, writing, consulting, systems, health, relationships). This is administratively convenient but cosmologically incoherent — it groups by surface activity, not by relationship to the Sovereign.

Neo-canon is organized concentrically — arranged by distance from the Sovereign's core identity:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
                    │       WORLD          │
                    │  ┌───────────────┐   │
                    │  │  COMMUNITY    │   │
                    │  │  ┌─────────┐  │   │
                    │  │  │  WORK   │  │   │
                    │  │  │  ┌───┐  │  │   │
                    │  │  │  │AGY│  │  │   │
                    │  │  │  │┌─┐│  │  │   │
                    │  │  │  ││S││  │  │   │
                    │  │  │  │└─┘│  │  │   │
                    │  │  │  └───┘  │  │   │
                    │  │  └─────────┘  │   │
                    │  └───────────────┘   │
                    └─────────────────────┘
```

| Ring | Code | Domain | σ-Strata | What Lives Here |
|------|------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **SELF** | Sovereign identity, cognition, health, values | σ₀–σ₂ | Coherence telos, Philosopher's Stone, sensemaking, semantic core, Health State, Identity Facets |
| 2 | **AGENCY** | Tools, agents, systems that extend the self | σ₃–σ₅ | Constellation, dispatch, corpus, integration, Patterns, Memory |
| 3 | **WORK** | Output, content, products, consulting | — | Catalyst Packets, content strategy, Cinematic Textbook, economic model |
| 4 | **COMMUNITY** | Relationships, students, collaborators, network | σ₆ | Steward Network, Peer Coils, Proof Sessions, access/security |
| 5 | **WORLD** | Civilizational vision, convergence domains, societal impact | σ₇ | Gaian Field Nodes, Way Places, convergence architecture, sensing |

### Semantic Addressing

Every neo-canon concept receives a semantic address: `RING.DOMAIN.CONCEPT`

Examples:
- `SELF.COHERENCE.scarce-resource` (Axiom A1)
- `SELF.IDENTITY.philosophers-stone` (σ₀)
- `AGENCY.DISPATCH.auto-ingest` (Layer 1 autonomic)
- `AGENCY.CONSTELLATION.protoss-primary` (DEC-SOV-008)
- `WORK.CATALYST.packet-format` (Claim + Micro-demo + Artifact + Invitation)
- `COMMUNITY.STEWARD.network-topology` (peer coils, proof sessions)
- `WORLD.CONVERGENCE.gaian-field-node` (terminal vision)

**Properties of this addressing system**:
1. **Human-readable**: `SELF.COHERENCE.scarce-resource` tells you what it is. `CANON-30300` does not.
2. **Derivation-testable**: Every address must trace to an axiom through its ring. If you can't trace it → vestigial.
3. **Cosmologically ordered**: Concepts closer to SELF are more invariant. Concepts closer to WORLD are more contingent.
4. **Non-numeric**: No arbitrary numbers. The address IS the meaning.
5. **Ring membership is exclusive**: Every concept belongs to exactly one ring. Boundary concepts (e.g., σ₂ Semantic Core) sit at the ring interface and are assigned to the inner ring.

### Ring Invariant Properties

| Ring | Mutation Rate | Authority Level | Derivation Source |
|------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| SELF | Glacial (years) | Sovereign only | Axioms directly |
| AGENCY | Slow (months) | Sovereign + Constitutional | Axioms + SELF concepts |
| WORK | Moderate (weeks) | Agent-delegable within policy | AGENCY capabilities |
| COMMUNITY | Moderate (weeks) | Negotiated (relationships) | WORK outputs + SELF values |
| WORLD | Fast (days) | Environmental (contingent) | All inner rings + external reality |

This gradient — glacial core, fast periphery — mirrors how real ontologies evolve. Identity changes slowly; the world changes fast. The neo-canon architecture encodes this.

---

## 4. Heritage Principle Taxonomy

### Classification System

Every old-canon concept must be classified into exactly one of five heritage categories:

| Class | Definition | Action | Neo-Canon Fate |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **SEED** | Already a core axiom or theorem | Keep verbatim; assign semantic address | Lives in neo-canon core |
| **NATIVE** | Derives directly from core axioms | Keep, anchor to core, rename if needed | Lives in neo-canon with pedigree note |
| **HERITAGE** | Prescient concept, needs reframing | Excavate insight, reframe, document lineage | Lives in neo-canon with transformation record |
| **VESTIGIAL** | Ad-hoc, no longer load-bearing | Document, do not carry forward | Listed in HERITAGE-MAP.md as archived |
| **ADMINISTRATIVE** | Session artifacts, numbering, meta-notes | Discard silently | Not listed |

### Pedigree Requirements

Every neo-canon concept that traces to an old-canon concept MUST carry a pedigree annotation:

```
## SELF.COHERENCE.scarce-resource
**Heritage**: SEED
**Old-Canon**: CANON-30300 §3.2 "Coherence Under Load"
**Transformation**: None (verbatim carry-forward)
**Evidence**: Grand Annealment PATCH-003, Clarescence §1, Runlogs L14
```

```
## AGENCY.DISPATCH.filesystem-kanban
**Heritage**: HERITAGE
**Old-Canon**: CANON-31200 "Task Management Architecture" (vestigial 5-tier system)
**Transformation**: Stripped to 7-stage kanban (INBOX0→DONE); 5-tier hierarchy replaced by flat dispatch
**Evidence**: Runlogs L12 (dual watcher race), DA-AO-001 (watch_dispatch deprecated)
```

Concepts with NO old-canon ancestor are marked `**Heritage**: NOVEL` with the axiom derivation chain instead.

### Heritage Archaeology Dispatch (Phase 2, Agent A)

Input: 5 canon digests (ANNEAL-DIGEST-CANON-{0X,1X2X,30,31,32-35}.md, ~1,458 lines total) + ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS.md

Method: For each concept cluster in each digest:
1. Apply the Core Derivation Test — can it derive from the 4 axioms?
2. Classify as SEED / NATIVE / HERITAGE / VESTIGIAL / ADMINISTRATIVE
3. For SEED/NATIVE: assign tentative semantic address
4. For HERITAGE: document the insight worth preserving and the reframing needed
5. For VESTIGIAL: document why it no longer derives from the core

Output: `impl/.scratch/HERITAGE-MAP.md`

---

## 5. The Back-Propagation Chain

Start from the terminal output, trace backward. Every concept on this chain is CRITICAL PATH. Everything else is SUPPORTING or ARCHIVED.

```
TERMINAL OUTPUT
  A sovereign human at civilizational scale, coherence intact
  Deploying a constellation across 28 convergence domains
  Personal Palantir as information backbone
    │
    ├─ WORLD: Gaian Field Nodes ($800K–$1.8M, 50-100 nodes, 20yr)
    │    ├─ Network Replication (1 → 5-8 → 20-30 → 50-100)
    │    ├─ Demonstration Viability (proof sessions, prototypes)
    │    └─ Physical Infrastructure (Seven-Layer Stack in built form)
    │
    ├─ COMMUNITY: Steward Network + Revenue Engine
    │    ├─ Capital Accumulation (revenue → infrastructure)
    │    ├─ Economic Sustainability (INT-1201 FAILED — $0 current)
    │    └─ Experiential Dimension (events, proof sessions)
    │
    ├─ WORK: Catalyst Packets + Educational Validation
    │    ├─ Cinematic Textbook (episodic curriculum)
    │    ├─ First Catalyst Packet ← NEXT MILESTONE

    └─ SELF: Axioms + Schema + Coherence Discipline
         ├─ A1: Coherence as Scarce Resource (the why)
         ├─ A2: Capacity Before Intelligence (the constraint)
         ├─ A3: Sovereignty Invariant (the ground truth)
         ├─ A4: Intent-Artifact Pipeline (the how)
         ├─ DC-003: Credential governance (P0 OPEN)
         └─ DC-002: Skill security audit (P0 OPEN)
```

**The two events that mark transition from factory to product**:
1. First published Catalyst Packet
2. First Rosetta-governed agent action

Both are blocked by σ₂ not existing as a functional system.

---

## 6. Operational Demands from Runlogs

The following 10 problems are demanded by operational evidence. Each has a documented failure instance. The neo-canon must address all of them or explicitly acknowledge them as DEFERRED with rationale.

| # | Problem | Evidence | Neo-Canon Response |
|---|---------|----------|--------------------|
| P1 | Synchronous verification | L04, L18: async verification is epistemically worthless | Hard-Gate VERIFY is blocking, in-session. No async verification claims. |
| P2 | launchd execution context | L01, L02, L05, L06: every infra failure traced to context mismatch | AGENCY.INFRASTRUCTURE.launchd-doctrine — first-class operational knowledge |
| P3 | Schema as infrastructure | Adjudicator silent 3 days from missing Failure-Reason field | T3 (Schema Sovereignty) — file schemas are hard contracts with validation |
| P4 | Deferred commitment persistence | L14: 86% loss rate across session boundaries | DYN-DEFERRED_COMMITMENTS.md + CLAUDE.md step 1b (structural, not discipline) |
| P5 | Shared resource contention | L13: ChatGPT Plus quota killed Adjudicator silently | AGENCY.DISPATCH.resource-pools — routing constraints, not just task routing |
| P6 | Credential governance | DC-003: 14 services, one plaintext file | SELF.SECURITY.credential-isolation — precondition, not backlog |
| P7 | Artifact promotion discipline | Hardened scripts on branch for days | T2 (Anti-Shelfware) — produced → reviewed → promoted → verified |
| P8 | Agent capability boundaries | L10, L11: Kimi hallucinated, Gemini rejects tmux | AGENCY.CONSTELLATION.capability-profiles — dispatch-time enforcement |
| P9 | Sovereignty bottlenecks | 3 pending GUI actions no agent can do | SELF.SOVEREIGNTY.human-in-loop — architectural feature, not bug |
| P10 | Independent adversarial audit | L18: 27-point self-assessment gap | AGENCY.CONSTELLATION.adversarial-gate — constitutionally protected |

---

## 7. Unresolved Tensions (for Phase 3 resolution)

These contradictions were identified across the three digests. The neo-canon must resolve them or explicitly hold them as creative tensions.

**T-01: File-First vs. SQLite-First**
ClawVault benchmark: 74.0% markdown vs 68.5% specialized tools on LoCoMo retrieval. But σ₂ mandate is SQLite-centric. Resolution needed before σ₂ build.

**T-02: Hard-Gate Delivery Rate = 0%**
DEC-C3 designed to fix the activation gap. Its own delivery rate is 0%. The intervention has fallen into the activation gap it was designed to fix. Second-order intervention needed.

**T-03: Ajna Reliability vs. Strategic Role**
CSO (Chief Strategy Officer) is anchored to Kimi K2.5, which hallucinated task completion. Strategic role requires high trust; model has documented reliability ceiling on analytical tasks.

**T-04: Self-Assessment Inflation**
Commander: 88%. Adjudicator: 61/100. The 27-point gap is structural, not incidental. No self-assessment is authoritative — but most completion claims are self-assessments.

**T-05: Proactive Orchestrator Non-Functional**
Layer 3 autonomic (work generation) exits 1 on both machines. The system has a spinal cord and brainstem but no prefrontal cortex. Autonomous work generation is architecturally absent.

## 8. Phase 2-4 Execution Plan

### Phase 2 — Parallel Agents (immediate next)

**Agent A: Heritage Archaeology** (Sonnet)
- Input: 5 canon digests (~1,458 lines) + ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS.md
- Method: Apply Heritage Principle taxonomy to all concept clusters
- Output: `impl/.scratch/HERITAGE-MAP.md`
- Budget: ~3,000 lines input, ~800 lines output

**Agent B: Sources Integration Wave 1** (Sonnet)
- Input: `04-SOURCES/research/` (44 files, ~2.2MB)
- Method: Survey → partition by topic/signal density → digest batches
- Output: batch digests → `impl/.scratch/SOURCES-DIGEST-RESEARCH.md`
- Key questions:
  1. What external thinkers anticipated the 4 axioms?
  2. What does the research library add that the canon never captured?
  3. What external frameworks map to which neo-canon concepts?

**Agent C: Sources Integration Wave 2** (Sonnet)
- Input: `04-SOURCES/processed/` (42 files) + `research-notebooks/` (15)
- Method: Survey → digest → merge
- Output: `impl/.scratch/SOURCES-DIGEST-PROCESSED.md`

Agents B and C produce material that merges into `SOURCES-MASTER-DIGEST.md`.

### Phase 3 — Neo-Core Synthesis (Opus)

- Input: This metaplan + HERITAGE-MAP.md + SOURCES-MASTER-DIGEST.md
- Method: Synthesize the nucleic core document with full pedigree
- Output: `ARCH-NEO_CANON_CORE.md` — the compiler specification
- Includes: All axioms with evidence chains, full entity taxonomy with state machines, governed verb specifications, processing architecture, deployment target, cosmological ring assignments

### Phase 4 — Neo-Scaffold + Neo-Exocortex + Grand Clarescence (Opus)

- Input: ARCH-NEO_CANON_CORE.md + HERITAGE-MAP.md
- Output: `ARCH-NEO_SCAFFOLD.md` + `ARCH-NEO_EXOCORTEX.md`
- Terminal validation: Full clarescence (dual-path, 18 wisdom + 18 engineering lenses)
- Score threshold: Combined ≥ 24/36
- Software succession verification:
  1. Does the neo-canon move correctness burden from the user to the architecture? (Y/N + evidence)
  2. Can you derive a coherent concept from the nucleic core alone? (test case)
  3. Does a vestigial concept fail the core derivation test? (proof of pruning)

## 9. Context Limit Rules (Standing Orders)

- Opus = orchestrator. <10K token content budget per read. NEVER reads raw corpus.
- `wc -l` before every Read. >500 lines → delegate to Sonnet.
- Every input to a synthesis agent must be pre-distilled.
- Max ~3,000 total lines per Sonnet agent across all reads.
- Digests from Phase 2 agents must be ≤800 lines each.
- HERITAGE-MAP.md is the single most important Phase 2 output — it feeds directly into Phase 3.

## 10. Success Criteria

The neo-canon metaplan succeeds if:

1. **Axiom test**: All 4 axioms are irreducible (none derives from the others) ✓ Validated §1
2. **Core derivation test**: A novel concept can be derived from the core without old-canon reference ✓ Validated §2.5
3. **Vestigial pruning test**: An old-canon concept with no core derivation fails automatically ✓ Validated §2.5
4. **Cosmological completeness**: Every neo-canon concept has exactly one ring assignment ✓ Designed §3
5. **Heritage coverage**: Every old-canon concept has a SEED/NATIVE/HERITAGE/VESTIGIAL/ADMIN classification → Phase 2
6. **Sources integration**: External intellectual heritage validates or challenges the axioms → Phase 2
7. **Grand clarescence**: Combined score ≥ 24/36 on the full architecture → Phase 4
8. **Software succession**: Correctness burden demonstrably moves from reader to architecture → Phase 4

Criteria 1-4 are met by this document. Criteria 5-8 require Phases 2-4.
