# STRATEGIC RECALIBRATION: 2026-01-30
## Post-Reconciliation Decision Framework

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Generated**: 2026-01-30
**Stream**: F (AJNA9-RECAL)
**Inputs**: Streams A (ROSETTA-STONE), B (Archaeology), C (Handbook), D (Pipeline), E (Accretion)
**Authority**: Executor synthesis -- decisions require Sovereign ratification

## Triumvirate Update

### Destination (UNCHANGED)

Civilizational sensing infrastructure demonstrating AI-amplified individual capability at institutional scale.

### Method (UPDATED)

**Previous**: SN + Chorus + parallel streams
**Current**: SN + **Constellation in Medley mode** + parallel streams + **ROSETTA-STONE terminology alignment**

Changes:
- "Chorus" corrected to "Medley" per community terminology reconciliation
- ROSETTA-STONE enables shared language with community without losing internal innovations
- Research Pipeline formalized for systematic tool integration
- Five Invariants identified for explicit constitutional status

### Current State (UPDATED)

| Metric | Before | After | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| CANON documents | 82 | 82 | No change |
| SN coverage | 100% | 100% | No change |
| Corpus coherence score | Unknown | **62/100** | Now measured |
| CANON internal coherence | Unknown | **77/100** | Now measured |
| Internal terms reconciled | 0 | **18** | Full reconciliation |
| Community gaps identified | 0 | **8** | Adoption candidates |
| Operational documents | Unknown | **6 new** | This directive's output |
| Ajna deletion readiness | Unknown | **5 items pending** | Pathway clear |

## Decision Resolutions

### D1: Ajna Thread Disposition

**Decision**: B -- Extract all value, then safe delete (with conditions)

**Rationale**: Stream B (Archaeology) identified that most Ajna tribal knowledge is already formalized. Only 5 items remain:
1. Five Invariants need explicit formalization in CLAUDE.md
2. Sovereignty Strata needs CANON/ORCHESTRATION commitment
3. Three new aphorisms need addition to APHORISMS.md
4. Two new proverbs need addition to PROVERBS.md
5. CAPTURE > DISPATCH > RETURN mnemonic needs documentation

**Action**:
- [ ] Complete the 5 pending items from AJNA-ARCHAEOLOGY.md
- [ ] Run deletion readiness checklist
- [ ] Delete Ajna threads 1-9 once all items green

---

### D2: OpenClaw Integration

**Decision**: A -- Deep research first, defer integration decision

**Rationale**: OpenClaw's explosive growth (114K stars) warrants investigation, but the security concerns (Cisco/Checkmarx) demand careful assessment before integration. The Research Pipeline (Stream D) provides the methodology. The integration hypothesis (OpenClaw as local orchestration layer) is plausible but unvalidated.

**Action**:
- [ ] Execute Phase 1-2 of Research Pipeline against OpenClaw
- [ ] Security assessment before any local installation
- [ ] Phase 3-4 synthesis and reconciliation
- [ ] Decision at Ajna10 based on findings

---

### D3: Terminology Adoption

**Decision**: B -- Selective adoption (superior patterns only)

**Rationale**: Stream A (ROSETTA-STONE) revealed a balanced picture:
- 5 terms are UNIQUE (preserve entirely): Triumvirate, Sovereignty Strata, 18 Lenses, SN Format, Chain Matrix
- 4 terms are ALIGNED (already convergent): Wells/Rivers, Oracle-Executor, Ralph Pattern, Chorus/Constellation
- 5 terms are ADAPTED (adopt community framing): Fingerprint/Handoff, Five Invariants, CAPTURE>DISPATCH>RETURN, Blitzkrieg, Lane A/B/C
- 2 terms are DEPRECATED (remove): IMEP, IIC Configs
- 2 terms need definition discovery (resolved): PALACE, Tri-Helix

**Action**:
- [x] ROSETTA-STONE written and committed
- [ ] Correct Chorus -> Medley in COCKPIT.md
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md Extended Thinking section (stale token allocations)
- [ ] Clean orphan IMEP references
- [ ] Adopt git worktree isolation language for Blitzkrieg lanes

---

### D4: Corpus Remediation

**Decision**: A -- Immediate fixes for highest-impact items, batch remainder

**Rationale**: Stream E (Accretion Verification) revealed a 62/100 coherence score with one critical finding: all 82 CANON root files contain zero wikilinks (invisible to Obsidian graph). This single fix would dramatically improve navigability. Lower-priority items can batch with next cycle.

**Action**:
- [ ] **Immediate**: Run `add_obsidian_backlinks.sh` or equivalent to convert bare CANON references to wikilinks in root files
- [ ] **Immediate**: Normalize 62 shortened wikilinks in SN files
- [ ] **Batch**: Add CANON bridge links to SIGMA7 files
- [ ] **Batch**: Add `integrated_into:` wikilinks to processed sources
- [ ] **Batch**: Prune -OUTGOING/outputs/ duplicates

---

### D5: Platform Role Updates

**Decision**: C -- Maintain current Constellation architecture, with research track for OpenClaw

**Rationale**: The current Constellation (8 roles across 7 platforms) is functional. Cowork MCP Apps are interesting but "coming soon" for full integration. OpenClaw requires research (D2). No immediate structural changes needed.

**Action**:
- [ ] Monitor Cowork MCP Apps rollout (Slack, Asana, Figma)
- [ ] Execute OpenClaw research pipeline
- [ ] Reassess at Ajna10 with research findings
- [ ] Consider adding OpenClaw as 9th role if research validates hypothesis

## Updated Backlog

### Tier 0 (Immediate -- this session or next)

1. Complete 5 pending Archaeology items (formalize Five Invariants, add aphorisms/proverbs, document CAPTURE>DISPATCH>RETURN)
2. Fix CLAUDE.md Extended Thinking section (stale since Jan 2026)
3. Correct Chorus -> Medley in COCKPIT.md
4. Convert CANON root bare-text references to wikilinks (highest-impact coherence fix)

### Tier 1 (This Week)

5. Normalize 62 shortened wikilinks in SN files
6. Clean orphan IMEP references from corpus
7. Commit Sovereignty Strata framework to CANON or ORCHESTRATION
8. Execute OpenClaw Research Pipeline Phase 1-2

### Tier 2 (This Month)

9. Add CANON bridge links to SIGMA7 files
10. Add `integrated_into:` wikilinks to processed sources
11. Prune -OUTGOING/outputs/ duplicates
12. Implement Self-Healing Constitution hook
13. Add `context: fork` to skills for subagent delegation
14. Evaluate git worktree isolation for Blitzkrieg lanes
15. Configure external automation (Keyboard Maestro, Hazel, Stream Deck)

## Next Oracle Session Scope (Ajna10)

### Primary Agenda

1. **Ratify decisions D1-D5** -- Sovereign approval of this recalibration
2. **OpenClaw research debrief** -- If Pipeline Phase 1-2 complete, assess findings
3. **Cowork MCP Apps assessment** -- Status of MCP Apps rollout, integration implications
4. **Coherence remediation review** -- Did wikilink fixes improve the 62/100 score?
5. **Five Invariants ratification** -- Sovereign approves constitutional formalization

### Secondary Agenda

6. Quick 5 Lenses variant -- Lightweight decision framework for low-stakes decisions
7. 30-Lens extension -- Decide: formalize or abandon
8. Automation priorities -- Which external tools to configure first
9. Lobster assessment -- If OpenClaw research reveals workflow shell capabilities

### Context to Carry

- Fingerprint: [generate at session start via `make token`]
- ROSETTA-STONE: `02-ENGINE/REF-ROSETTA_STONE.md`
- Coherence baseline: 62/100 overall, 77/100 CANON internal
- Deletion readiness: 5 items pending for Ajna 1-9 deletion
