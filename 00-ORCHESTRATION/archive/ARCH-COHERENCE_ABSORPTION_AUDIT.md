## WHAT THE DIRECTIVE-018 CLAIMED vs REALITY

### The Claim (Oracle5)
> "2.8M → 85K (97% compression)" — Coherence distilled into ARCHIVE/

### The Reality
- ARCHIVE/ contained only ~12K of preserved content
- [[CANON-20000-PALACE-lattice]] contained ~16K (conceptual framework, not implementation)
- **Gap**: 57K+ of claimed distillation never existed or was never committed
- **Original Coherence/**: Deleted after "completion" was claimed

### Why This Happened
1. DIRECTIVE-013 (Oracle4) surveyed Coherence
2. DIRECTIVE-018 (Oracle5) claimed distillation complete
3. Verification step was skipped
4. Original deleted based on claimed completion
5. Actual preservation was ~1% of claimed amount

### The Save
- Git preserved everything at commit `96edf93` (Initial commit)
- All 3.8M of content fully recoverable
- Recovery executed successfully on 2026-01-02

## ABSORPTION STATUS MATRIX

| Content | CANON Location | Absorption Level | Gap |
|---------|----------------|------------------|-----|
| Cognitive Palace conceptual | [[CANON-20000-PALACE-lattice]] | Adequate | None |
| Cognitive Palace implementation | ARCHIVE-001 | Partial | 95% detail lost |
| Metahumanism | CANON-35xxx (references only) | Minimal | 99% content lost |
| Mental Models | None | None | 100% lost |
| Artifacts | ARCHIVE-002 | Index only | 99% content lost |
| Macroscopic Narratives | None | None | 100% lost |
| Meta-Narrative Schemas | None | None | 100% lost |

## RECOVERY RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (Completed)

1. ✅ Recovered all content from git commit `96edf93`
2. ✅ Copied to `outputs/recovery/` for review
3. ✅ Created this audit document

### Integration Recommendations

1. **Create CANON-00015-MACROSCOPIC_NARRATIVES-cosmos.md**
   - Use recovered macroscopic_narratives.md as source
   - Essential for source triage interpretive framework

2. **Decide on Coherence/ restoration approach**:
   - Option A: Restore full Coherence/ to repository (adds 3.2M)
   - Option B: Create condensed ARCHIVE entries for each major section
   - Option C: Leave in outputs/recovery/ as reference archive
   - **Recommendation**: Option C for now, with [[CANON-00015-MACROSCOPIC_NARRATIVES-cosmos]] creation

3. **Update ARCHIVE/ with proper distillations if needed**
   - Metahumanism deserves proper archival treatment
   - Mental Models deserve proper archival treatment

## FAILURE MODE ANALYSIS

### Root Causes

1. **Verification Failure**: Claimed completion without size/content verification
2. **Trust Without Verification**: Accepted claim of 97% compression without checking
3. **Premature Deletion**: Removed source before confirming preservation
4. **No Recovery Test**: Didn't verify content could be reconstructed from distillation

### Prevention Protocol (For Future)

1. **Verification Before Deletion**: NEVER delete source until distillation VERIFIED by:
   - Size check: Output must exist with claimed size
   - Content spot-check: Random items must be findable in output
   - Reconstruction test: Can original be approximated from distillation?

2. **Sovereign Review**: Major deletions (>100K) require Sovereign confirmation

3. **Git Safety Net**: Always commit before major deletions (this saved us)

4. **Audit Trail**: Document what was preserved vs deleted with evidence

---

## CONCLUSION

**The feared 99% loss was averted through git archaeology.**

All content exists at commit `96edf93` and has been successfully recovered to `outputs/recovery/`. The Sovereign's foundational work on Cognitive Palace, Metahumanism, Mental Models, Artifacts, and Macroscopic Narratives is fully preserved.

The gap between claimed and actual distillation represents a process failure that has been documented for prevention. The content itself remains intact.
