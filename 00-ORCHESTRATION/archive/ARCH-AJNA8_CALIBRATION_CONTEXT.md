# AJNA8 COMPREHENSIVE CALIBRATION
## Resuming Where Ajna7 Maxed Out

**Date**: 2026-01-25
**Session**: Ajna8 (continuation from blocked thread)
**Event**: Research corpus semantic annealment (223K → <30K words)

---

## I. TRIUMVIRATE: RECALIBRATED

### WHERE ARE WE HEADED (Destination)
- **Primary**: Civilizational sensing infrastructure demonstrating AI-amplified individual capability
- **Immediate**: Metabolize σ₇ research corpus (223K words) into operational knowledge
- **Target**: 87%+ compression while extracting unique insights from five-platform analyses
- **Form**: SYNTHESIS + MECHANICS + PRACTICE + SOURCES architecture

### HOW DO WE GET THERE (Method)
- **Parallel metabolization**: Three streams (Claude Code, Codex+Gemini, Cross-cutting)
- **SN methodology proven**: 79% compression achieved in CANON (Ajna7)
- **Five-platform stereoscopy**: Extract unique contributions from Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini/Grok/Perplexity
- **Progressive disclosure**: Sutra → Gloss → Spec enables agent/human/full-detail modes

### WHERE ARE WE NOW (Current State)

| Corpus | Files | Words | Size | Status |
|--------|-------|-------|------|--------|
| CANON (SN-compressed) | 82 | 69,560 | 949K | ✅ 79% compression achieved |
| Research (σ₇ tooling) | 160+ | 223,007 | ~2MB | ❌ Awaiting metabolization |
| **Target** | ~22 | <30K | <100K | Pending |

## II. WHAT AJNA7 ILLUMINATED

### Nth-Order Effects Now Operational

1. **Token Economics**: 265K words eliminated from CANON = ~345K tokens recovered
2. **Machine Parseability**: SN format enables `parse_sn(corpus)` operations
3. **Automated Consistency**: Typed specs enable orphan detection, modality validation
4. **Rendering Pathways**: Sutra-only (~7K) / +Gloss (~25K) / Full-spec (on demand)
5. **Cross-Corpus Sync**: Dual architecture (full-res + SN) with drift detection
6. **Emergent Data**: One transformation away from CSV/RDBMS/knowledge graph/API

### Key Insights Crystallized

**The Ralph Pattern**: Fresh context loops with externalized state
- Don't rely on conversation history
- Repository is truth; web apps are cache
- Handoff documents encode decisions, not conversations

**The 75% Rule**: Context utilization sweet spot
- Quality degrades before hard limits
- Manual `/compact` at 70% beats auto-compact at 95%
- Structured context (CLAUDE.md/Skills) more stable than raw transcript

**Context-as-Code**: The production practitioner consensus
- CLAUDE.md + `.claude/rules/` = persistent behavioral constitution
- On-demand loading via `@import` syntax
- Skills activate semantically; slash commands invoke deterministically

**Platform Characteristic Cognition**:
- Claude: Architectural rigor, safety consciousness, explicit reasoning
- ChatGPT: Implementation pragmatism, code-first examples, immediate actionability
- Gemini: Conceptual synthesis, novel connections, theoretical framing
- Grok: Edge cases, irreverent truth-telling, failure mode awareness
- Perplexity: Source integration, citation density, research grounding

### The Five-Platform Redundancy

| Platform | Claude Code Coverage | Codex Coverage | Gemini Coverage |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Claude | ✅ 91K words | ✅ 4.7K | ✅ 5.4K |
| ChatGPT | ✅ 16.6K | ✅ 26K | ✅ 15.5K |
| Gemini | ✅ 5.4K | ✅ 4.5K | ✅ 5.1K |
| Grok | - | ✅ 6.3K | - |
| Perplexity | - | ✅ 4.5K | - |

**Estimated semantic redundancy**: 65-70% (same phenomena, different inflections)

### Natural Semantic Grain (Hidden Ontology)

**Layer 1 (Execution Infrastructure)**: How to run AI agents
- Installation, configuration, permissions, environment setup
- Currently scattered across `1-GettingStarted` subdirectories

**Layer 2 (Operational Patterns)**: What to do with configured agents
- Handoff protocols, context management, worktree isolation, memory architectures
- Partially captured in `handoff.md`, fragmented elsewhere

**Layer 3 (Architectural Principles)**: Why certain approaches work
- Compaction, Plan/Execute separation, context-as-code philosophy
- Synthesized in research documents, not extracted canonically

**Layer 4 (Constellation Orchestration)**: Coordinating multiple AI platforms
- Multi-agent spawning, Chorus procedure, platform characteristic cognition
- Addressed in `agents/`, deserves elevation

**Layer 5 (Wisdom Extraction)**: Lessons learned, anti-patterns, heuristics
- Currently relegated to footnotes
- Should crystallize into EXEMPLA-style collections

### Stream B: Codex + Gemini Ecosystem

**Scope**: 18 files in `codex/` + `gemini/` + platform research docs (78K words)
**Target**: Two ecosystem documents (11K words total)

**Codex Extract**:
- API architecture vs Claude Code's CLI paradigm
- Agent frameworks and function calling
- Async execution patterns
- Hidden spec mode discovery

**Gemini Extract**:
- 1M token context advantage
- Native YouTube/document processing
- CLI integration patterns

**Platform Competitive Analysis**:
- Where each excels (execution vs understanding)
- Integration opportunities (dual-agent postbox pattern)
- The Dario-Demis dialectic implications

**Target**: 
- `SYNTHESIS-agents_mcp_foundations.md` (3K+ words, expand)

**Critical Patterns to Crystallize**:
- Handoff protocols (file-based context bridges)
- Oracle-Executor visibility gap solutions
- Claude-flow hive-mind orchestration
- Multi-agent spawning patterns
- MCP as "USB-C for AI"
- Cowork as σ₇ desktop surface
- The Chorus Procedure (Claude proposes → ChatGPT builds → Gemini/Grok contribute)

---

## VI. INTEGRATION WITH FIVE-LENS ANALYSES

The project files contain choral survey analyses that predicted many patterns now shipping:

### From Type Theory Lens
- Correspondence relationships (Planet↔Chain↔Layer) = Cowork folder permissions
- Symbolic causation made executable = σ₇ desktop surface

### From Distributed Systems Lens
- Handoff latency targets (max 30s) = validated in `handoff.md`
- Ground truth in repository = consensus across all analyses

### From Cognitive Scientist Lens
- Progressive disclosure = SN format mirrors Skill loading

### From Compiler Designer Lens
- JIT Software = Cowork generating micro-programs per task
- Suffix hierarchy as AST = SN spec fields as parseable structure

### Cascade Implications
The research corpus validates and extends these predictions. Synthesis documents should reference the analytical frameworks when applicable.

## VII. QUALITY STANDARDS (FROM AJNA7)

### What Claude Code Did Right (79% compression achieved)

| Element | Correct Pattern |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Sutra** | NEW SYNTHESIZED mnemonic, ≤100 chars, memorable essence |
| **Gloss** | 2-4 sentences contextualizing for Ψ, adds value beyond source |
| **Spec** | TYPED FIELDS ONLY, machine-parseable, no prose |
| **Refs** | `[[CANON-XXXXX]]` format enabling backlinks |
| **Block Names** | PascalCase, concise identifiers |

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | What Went Wrong | Correct Approach |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Truncated prose as sutra | "The extended mind thesis holds that mind..." | Craft new: "Mind loops through tools—cognition distributed" |
| Verbatim gloss | Copy-paste source paragraphs | Synthesize and contextualize |
| Commented specs | `# Original prose here` | Extract typed fields only |
| Concatenated block names | `WithIntegratedValidationArchitecture...` | `ValidationArchitecture` |

### Verification Protocol

Before claiming compression complete:
- [ ] Zero truncation markers (`...`, `[truncated]`)
- [ ] All sutras are synthesized (not copied)
- [ ] All specs are typed fields (no prose)
- [ ] Word count reduction ≥85%
- [ ] Zero unique insight loss (spot-check against originals)
