## Axiom: CC32-B1-AX01 — Constitutional AI as Operational Pattern (Central Dogma Enforcement)

> Constitutional AI is a method where AI training, specifically the post-training steering phase, involves a central document of values and principles that the model reads and keeps in mind for every training task, aiming to produce a model that consistently follows this constitution. This atom is preserved as the living Central Dogma of Syncrescendence: canon/01-CANON is DNA, AGENTS.md is mRNA, make configs is the ribosome translating it into agent behavior (protein). It hardens the ontology gate as MHC self-recognition — every incoming atom must present the Five Invariants or be lysed. It closes the 4-connection minimum by making config propagation the enzyme that prevents retroviral drift (agents editing sources). It validates the existing architecture and turns theoretical Constitutional AI into operational immune memory.

- source_atom_ids: [ATOM-SOURCE-20260204-website-article-darioamodei-the_adolescence_of_technology-0028]
- why_preserved: Constitutional AI pattern is the theoretical foundation for AGENTS.md inheritance — canonicalizing closes the loop between external research and internal practice. Canon is DNA, AGENTS.md is mRNA, make configs is the ribosome.

## Axiom: CC32-B1-AX02 — Three-Layer Memory Architecture (Hippocampal-Neocortical Consolidation)

> A three-layer memory architecture for personal AI assistants includes a Knowledge Graph (long-term declarative memory), Daily Notes (episodic memory), and Tacit Knowledge (procedural memory). This atom is preserved as the synaptic consolidation protocol that turns praxis/05-SIGMA (hippocampus buffer) into canon/01-CANON (neocortex). It formalizes the minimum viable memory stack for the next 30 days (repo MEMORY.md + DYN-DEFERRED_COMMITMENTS + ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS) and enforces weekly Sleep_Cycle pruning (LTD for noise, LTP for canon_delta ≥1). It resolves C-012 and turns partial agent memory into measurable throughput.

- source_atom_ids: [ATOM-SOURCE-20260131-002-0003]
- why_preserved: Three-layer taxonomy (declarative/episodic/procedural) maps directly to existing agents/*/memory/ structure — canonicalizing formalizes what already works and resolves C-012 (minimum viable memory).

## Axiom: CC32-B1-AX03 — Observe-Before-Act Pattern (Free-Energy Minimization Gate)

> The PAI Algorithm's OBSERVE phase is a thinking-only phase, designed to analyze feedback and generate improvement recommendations without implementing changes. This atom is preserved as the thermodynamic activation-energy gate that minimizes free energy waste. It is the exact INBOUND → ORIENT → IMPLEMENT sequence (DEC-C3) and the nucleation event that ends every session with a git commit. It connects to the 4-connection minimum by making triangulation quality the catalyst only when Shannon entropy exceeds 4.0 bits. It anchors the observe-before-act pattern as the immune checkpoint that prevents means-ends inversion and guarantees every pathway terminates at canon.

- source_atom_ids: [ATOM-SOURCE-20260213-019-0003]
- why_preserved: Observe-before-act is the research basis for INBOUND → ORIENT → IMPLEMENT gate sequence — canonicalizing validates the existing protocol design and prevents means-ends inversion.
