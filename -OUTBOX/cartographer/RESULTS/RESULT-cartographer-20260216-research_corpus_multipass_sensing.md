**Agent**: Cartographer

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the findings of a 5-pass deep sensing inspection of the 14 research notebook directories located at `04-SOURCES/research-notebooks/`. The corpus is generally well-organized, with file counts matching the manifest and high thematic relevance within each notebook. Several cross-cutting themes emerged, including the rise of AI agents, security concerns, the future of work, agent memory, and multi-agent orchestration. A ranking of the top 15 most valuable articles shows significant overlap with the existing "VERY HIGH" signal list, validating the current curation strategy. Finally, several gap topics were identified, suggesting areas for future research and acquisition.
