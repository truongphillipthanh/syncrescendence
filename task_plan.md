# Task Plan: Cartographer Reactivation & MODEL-INDEX Refresh

## Goal
Reactivate the Cartographer agent (CIO) and execute a high-fidelity refresh of the model intelligence ledger (`02-ENGINE/REF-MODEL_INDEX.md`) and platform status (`02-ENGINE/DYN-PLATFORMS.md`). Prove CIO efficacy by producing detailed, high-signal intelligence output (>100 lines).

## Current Phase
