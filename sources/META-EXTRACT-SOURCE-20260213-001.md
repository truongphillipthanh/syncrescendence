## Claim (5)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260213-001-0001
**Lines**: 6-8
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.90

> Traditional methods of capturing engineering team knowledge (wikis, READMEs, onboarding docs) often become stale quickly because the effort of documentation is deprioritized compared to shipping features.

**Lines**: 10-11
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.90

> Stale documentation leads to longer ramp-up times for new engineers, senior engineers repeatedly answering the same questions, and recurring mistakes due to conventions residing only in individuals' minds.

**Lines**: 24-25
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The @cognition system allows knowledge to emerge from natural corrections, eliminating the need for engineers to consciously think about documentation while working.

**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The described system allows team conventions, deployment quirks, internal library preferences, and common pitfalls to accumulate organically from corrections, rather than through explicit documentation efforts.

**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> A new engineer using this system can benefit from the accumulated team conventions immediately through the agent, without needing to read documentation or search communication channels.

## Praxis Hook (5)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260213-001-0003
**Lines**: 15-15
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> @cognition captures knowledge as a side effect of engineers making corrections, rather than requiring dedicated documentation writing.

**Lines**: 17-20
**Context**: method / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.50

> When an engineer corrects an AI agent (e.g., @DevinAI) with a specific instruction, the system suggests saving that correction as a knowledge item for future retrieval across the organization.
