## Description (no transcript available)

🔥 *WHY YOUR 2026 RESOLUTIONS ARE ALREADY DEAD*

Stop setting goals. Start building identity. The Buddha never taught New Year resolutions—he taught something far more powerful: identity transformation through karma as training. While your goals die by February 12th, Buddhist wisdom offers a 2,500-year-old system that actually works. This isn't about achieving more—it's about becoming someone different.

🎊 *Happy New Year from Matt & Peter!* 
As this new year is just starting, we want to thank you for walking this path with us.
Wherever you are in your journey, may the coming year bring clarity, presence, and compassion.
Happy New Year from Matt & Peter 🙏

Instead of asking "what will you achieve in 2026?" we're asking: "who will you become?" This video is our gift to you... a different way to approach this year.

*DISCOVER:*
- Why 92% of resolutions fail by February (and what the Buddha knew about this 2,500 years ago)
- How karma actually works: every action is a vote for who you're becoming
- What the Buddha actually taught about change and becoming
- How craving disguises itself as motivation
- A Buddhist way to approach the New Year without false promises

🙏 *If this changed how you think about New Year resolutions, subscribe to Buddha's Wisdom for weekly videos that make ancient Buddhist teachings relevant to modern life. Drop a comment with ONE identity you're building in 2026: "I'm someone who..."*
