## Description (no transcript available)

We are delighted to award Jensen Huang (CEO of NVIDIA) with the Professor Stephen Hawking Fellowship Award for 2025, as Presented by Stephen Hawking's family.

This event took place in the Debating Chamber at 6pm on Tuesday 4th November 2025.

The Professor Stephen Hawking Fellowship is awarded to an individual or group who has made a significant impact on science, technology and its communication, with an emphasis on impacts affecting the younger generations. It is particularly notable in that it is awarded by the students of Cambridge, rather than the University itself. 

The fellowship is presented at an event in our chamber during Michaelmas term, during which the fellow gives an address and to which we also welcome the scientific advisory panel and members of the Hawking family.

JENSEN HUANG

Jensen Huang founded NVIDIA in 1993 and has served since its inception as president, chief executive officer, and a member of the board of directors. 

Since its founding, NVIDIA has pioneered accelerated computing. The company’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, and ignited the era of modern AI. NVIDIA is now driving the platform shift of accelerated computing and generative AI, transforming the world’s largest industries and profoundly impacting society.

Huang has been elected to the National Academy of Engineering and is a recipient of the Semiconductor Industry Association’s highest honor, the Robert N. Noyce Award; the IEEE Founder’s Medal; the Dr. Morris Chang Exemplary Leadership Award; and honorary doctorate degrees from Taiwan’s National Chiao Tung University, National Taiwan University, and Oregon State University.

He has been named the world’s best CEO by Fortune, the Economist, and Brand Finance, as well as one of TIME magazine’s 100 most influential people. 

Prior to founding NVIDIA, Huang worked at LSI Logic and Advanced Micro Devices. He holds a BSEE degree from Oregon State University and an MSEE degree from Stanford University.
