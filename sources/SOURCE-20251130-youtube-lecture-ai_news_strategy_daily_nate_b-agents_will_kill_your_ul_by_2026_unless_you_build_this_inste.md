_______________________
What’s really happening with software interfaces in the age of AI agents? The common story is that great products live or die by their beautiful, coherent UI — but the reality is more complicated.  ￼

In this video, I share the inside scoop on how generative UI, agentic software, and disposable pixels are reshaping B2B SaaS and enterprise tools:
• Why coherent interfaces were an economic hack, not destiny.
• How agentic layers sit over durable substrates and systems of record.
• What disposable pixels mean for SaaS moats, schemas, and APIs.
• Where designers, PMs, and engineers must reskill around intent.

For B2B SaaS leaders and builders, the opportunity is to treat AI strategy as substrate-first and agent-ready, while the risk is clinging to pixel-perfect monoliths that agents and users will route around.
