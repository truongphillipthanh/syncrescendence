What if everything you know about human history is just the last 5%?

For 100,000 years before civilization, our ancestors thrived in a world we've almost completely forgotten. They created stunning art, survived ice ages, migrated across continents, and built complex spiritual beliefs—all without writing, cities, or agriculture.

This episode of Sleepy Time History explores the missing millennia of human existence. Discover who the first anatomically modern humans really were, how hunter-gatherers lived, the mysteries of prehistoric cave paintings, and why humans suddenly decided to abandon nomadic life for farming and civilization.

We'll dive into ancient human migration patterns, lost technologies, and the spiritual beliefs that shaped our ancestors' understanding of the world. These aren't just dusty historical facts—they're keys to understanding who we are today.

Whether you're a history enthusiast, archaeology lover, or just looking for a fascinating deep dive before bed, this video reveals the untold story of humanity's deep past.

Subscribe to Sleepy Time History for more episodes exploring the mysteries of human history, ancient civilizations, and the stories that shaped our world. Perfect for sleep, study, or pure curiosity.

Note on Process & Accuracy:
Every story on this channel begins with a deep respect for history. We act as directors and editors, using AI tools to help research and draft the script while we shape the narrative and verify facts. The narration comes from a digital replica of a professional voice actor, and the images are individually crafted artistic impressions using AI. Even with these tools, creating a story of this depth still takes hours of work.

Please note that while the narrative is thoroughly based on historical research, its primary purpose is storytelling for entertainment and relaxation. As such, it is not intended to be used as a formal academic or scientific source. Thank you for your trust and support.
