What's really happening in AI infrastructure as we enter 2026? The common story is it's just about faster chips — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on 10 AI stories shaping how we build in 2026:
- Why NVIDIA's Vera Rubin platform defines the AI factory future
- How power constraints became the real compute bottleneck
- What Meta's $2B Manus acquisition means for AI agents
- Where MCP joining Linux Foundation enables enterprise AI adoption

Chapters:
00:00 - Introduction: 10 AI Stories That Matter for 2026 
00:27 - Story 1: NVIDIA's Vera Rubin Platform at CES 
01:37 - Story 2: Meta Acquires Manus for $2B 
02:20 - Story 3: AMD's CES Counterpunch and Enterprise Play 
04:11 - Story 4: Microsoft Partners with MISO on Grid Modernization 
05:55 - Story 5: The Bring Your Own Power Fight 
08:05 - Story 6: MCP Joins the Linux Foundation 
09:10 - Story 7: Google Launches Managed MCP Servers 
10:42 - Story 8: OpenAI Says Prompt Injection Not Solvable 
12:20 - Story 9: Cursor Acquires Graphite for Code Review

The winners in 2026 won't be who generates code fastest — they'll be who makes AI infrastructure boring, reliable, and governable as power grids, prompt injection battles, and agent security become permanent strategic dependencies.
