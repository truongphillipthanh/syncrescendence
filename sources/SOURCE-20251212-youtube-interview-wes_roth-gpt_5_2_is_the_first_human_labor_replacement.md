VIDEO SUMMARY
In this video, we test the newly released GPT 5.2 Pro and its "extended thinking" capabilities. We push the model to create complex 3D simulations—including a spherical Conway's Game of Life and a destructible city game—in a single prompt. The results show a model that acts less like a chatbot and more like a remote engineer, taking up to an hour to reason through code architecture before delivering a final project.

We also break down the new "GDPval" benchmark. unlike traditional tests, this evaluates AI against human experts with an average of 14 years of experience in fields ranging from finance to mechanical engineering.

The latest AI News. Learn about LLMs, Gen AI and get ready for the rollout of AGI. Wes Roth covers the latest happenings in the world of OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, NVIDIA and Open Source AI.
