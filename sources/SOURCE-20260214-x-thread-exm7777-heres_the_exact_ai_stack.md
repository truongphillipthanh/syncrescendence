# AI Stack Thread
here's the exact AI stack i'll be using from now on for my business, content creation and OpenClaw...
> writing: Claude Opus 4.6 + Kimi K2.5
> coding: GPT-5.3-Codex + Opus 4.6
> general tasks: MiniMax M2.5
> images: Nano Banana Pro
> video: Seedance 2.0
now here's what i really think:
if you're just starting with AI... ignore all of this
pick ONE provider, learn prompting, build real workflows and get the fundamentals down before you touch a second model
but bro if you want to get the best out of AI, you need to be in the trenches
