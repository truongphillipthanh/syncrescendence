In this episode of Silicon Valley Girl, Marina Mogilko sits down with Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI and co-founder of DeepMind, to explore how AI is reshaping the future of work, education, and everyday life.
Mustafa has spent the last decade building the systems that sparked the modern AI revolution. Today, he’s leading Microsoft AI and shaping how billions of people will interact with intelligent agents in the coming years. From the race toward AGI to the rise of AI assistants that remember everything, Mustafa offers a rare inside look at where the next decade is heading.
He shares why routine work is disappearing, what jobs will matter most, whether children will even need college, and how superintelligent systems could change the rhythm of a normal day. This conversation is a clear, grounded roadmap to the future — and to the skills we’ll all need to stay ahead.
