## Description (no transcript available)

Nvidia’s blowout earnings Wednesday affirmed its place as the world’s most valuable company, thanks to “off the charts” sales of GPUs that excel at AI workloads. But as inference needs outpace training, a smaller cheaper AI chip is gaining ground. Custom ASICs are now being designed by all the major hyperscalers. Google led the way with its TPU, followed by Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI’s plans with Broadcom. CNBC talked to experts and insiders at the Big Tech companies making them all.
