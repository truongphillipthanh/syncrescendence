## Claim (4)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260203-020-0001
**Lines**: 6-7
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.90

> The cost of integrations and simple CRUD software glue has collapsed to near zero, allowing anyone to wire together an app doing some API calls in minutes.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260203-020-0002
**Lines**: 13-16
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The user of software is changing, moving beyond human users, which has significant and underestimated implications for software and infrastructure.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260203-020-0005
**Lines**: 31-36
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Agent UX is critically important, and tools should be intuitive to agents by being similar to tools they already know or by solving problems in a way agents prefer to think.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260203-020-0008
**Lines**: 55-59
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Most software built today, especially simple API wrappers or LLM calls, will not survive because the barrier to shipping is low, and agents can synthesize such components on demand.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260203-020-0007
**Lines**: 48-51
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Agent DX (Developer Experience) means creating interfaces that align with how agents are trained (e.g., Reinforcement Learning), enabling them to configure, deploy, query, and optimize their own systems through self-reinforcing loops.

## Framework (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260203-020-0003
**Lines**: 21-23
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Software will survive the rise of agents if it saves cognition, according to Steve Yegge's 'Software Survival 3.0' model.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260203-020-0009
**Lines**: 62-62
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Software that will survive the rise of agents includes systems that compress hard-won insights, operate on cheaper substrates than inference, solve hard universal problems agents cannot easily route around, and are built for how agents actually work.

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260203-020-0006
**Lines**: 43-46
**Context**: method / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> To enable agents to use an API not in their pre-training data, make the API verifiable by returning structured feedback so agents can self-correct through a loop of querying, observing failure, reading errors, and correcting.

## Prediction (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260203-020-0004
**Lines**: 26-29
**Context**: speculation / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Code search will become harder as LLMs produce 10x-100x more code, necessitating better search tools for agents than current solutions like grep.
