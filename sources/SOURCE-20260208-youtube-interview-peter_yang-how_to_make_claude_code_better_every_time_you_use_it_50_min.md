## Description (no transcript available)

Kieran my favorite Claude Code power user and teacher. In our interview, he walked through his Compound Engineering system that makes Claude Code better every time you use it. This same system has been embraced by the Claude Code team and others. Kieran is like Morpheus introducing me to the matrix, so don’t miss this episode 🙂

Kieran and I talked about:
(00:00) The compound engineering loop: Plan, work, assess, compound
(03:40) Live demo: The /workflows command to plan your app
(13:25) How to use Claude Skills as just-in-time context
(25:27) Why you should always ask Claude to ask you questions first
(30:00) Live demo: Using Playwright MCP as your AI QA team
(35:03) Code reviews by AI agents playing security, architect, and more
(40:33) The LFG command: one prompt to go from 0 to production
(46:39) Slash commands vs sub-agents vs skills — when to use each
