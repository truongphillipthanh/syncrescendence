## Description (no transcript available)

Nvidia reported blowout results and framed three platform shifts: GPU-accelerated computing, generative AI transforming applications, and the emergence of agentic and physical AI. U.S. approval of advanced AI chip sales to Middle Eastern firms and a proposed federal "Genesis" AI initiative highlight geopolitical and regulatory shifts. OpenAI rolled out a teacher-focused ChatGPT workspace while AI music startup Suno raised $250 million amid copyright battles and rapid consumer-driven revenue growth.
