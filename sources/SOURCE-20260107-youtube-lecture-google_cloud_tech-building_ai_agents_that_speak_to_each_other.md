Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A) →https://goo.gle/4ape29o

Integrating AI agents shouldn't feel like hacking a travel adapter. If you're tired of writing endless "glue code" to make your Python agents talk to your Node backend, you need a standard interface. 

Join Amit Maraj as he introduces the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol—a universal standard that lets agents communicate like microservices using a simple .well-known/agent.json contract. We’ll also dive into critical architecture patterns, treating your Orchestrator as a "Project Manager" with a "Master Clipboard" of state, ensuring your worker agents remain stateless, scalable, and crash-resistant using the Agent Development Kit (ADK).
