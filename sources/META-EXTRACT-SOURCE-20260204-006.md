## Claim (5)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260204-006-0001
**Lines**: 9-13
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.20

> The narrative that "Software is Dead" and that anyone can now build complex applications like Facebook or Shopify using plain English programming is prevalent across various online platforms and even in stock markets.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260204-006-0002
**Lines**: 18-23
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.30

> The current boom in mobile app development, particularly within the Apple ecosystem, is driven by the ease of entry, requiring only an Apple Developer subscription, an AI subscription (e.g., Claude or Codex), and design tools like Figma.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260204-006-0003
**Lines**: 28-33
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.30, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Despite the ease of entry into coding with AI, the reality is a proliferation of low-quality, unoriginal applications (e.g., 1 million habit trackers, screen time apps, broken fitness apps) rather than innovative alternatives to major platforms.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260204-006-0004
**Lines**: 33-34
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.30, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Many new applications developed by 'non-technical guys' exhibit security negligence, such as leaked API keys and exposed credentials.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260204-006-0006
**Lines**: 45-47
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Building complex software projects requires more than just AI tools and plain English; it necessitates fundamental knowledge of cybersecurity, architecture, and effective scaling.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260204-006-0005
**Lines**: 39-42
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.30

> The 'Temu of tech' describes low-quality apps that gain temporary visibility (e.g., via TikTok views) but are not sustainable and will likely disappear within a year due to their lack of utility and the continuous development of similar alternatives.

## Prediction (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260204-006-0007
**Lines**: 50-50
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.20

> The number of low-quality, 'vibe-coded' apps is expected to double or triple, posing a problem for platforms like Apple as it becomes increasingly difficult to find functional applications.
