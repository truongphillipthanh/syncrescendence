synopsis: "Argues that AI-caused unemployment may never materialize because AI agents will create massive demand for physical labor that robots cannot yet fulfill, and historical precedent shows that scaling from villages to billions consistently produced more employment and higher living standards, not less."
key_insights: ["The bottleneck through the 2030s is physical labor — millions of AI agents will generate work orders that fewer than 100M humanoid robots cannot fulfill", "Historical scaling from villages to nations to global economy consistently increased both employment and median living standards at each order-of-magnitude population increase", "Post-labor economics may become an option people choose, but not an inevitability forced by displacement"]

# AI-Caused Unemployment May Never Come

(Description: A futuristic industrial warehouse scene. On the left, a humanoid robot with a white and black metallic face and glowing blue eyes stands facing right. On the right, a human worker in a blue hard hat and navy work jacket smiles while holding a cardboard box. Multiple other robots work in the blurred background under bright industrial lighting.)

I'm very skeptical that agents and robots will reduce human employment opportunities. I think they will instead massively expand them.

## Why? Because for years and years, we'll likely have four true things at the same time:

1. **AI Agents that are incredibly competent business leaders/innovators/operators.** Probably by 2027 in a big way.

2. **LOADS of real physical work that must get done** that these agents, who live in the cloud in data centers, literally cannot do.

3. **A shitload of humans who can do real physical work.**

4. **Not even 100 million humanoid robots deployed in the workforce.** Possibly as few as a million or less by 2027. Thus, not even many orders of magnitude enough physical laborers to do all the work these AI agents will have cued up. And because these AI agents will be in swarms by the millions... they're gonna want to create LOADS of businesses and will soak up human labor like WOAH.

I think that up through maybe even the early 2030s, we simply won't have enough robots to make a dent into overall human employment numbers.

## But what about after?

Well, back when we lived in villages of 1,000 people, it would have been inconceivable to most people that city-states of tens of thousands of people could have both gainful employment for that many people and a higher standard of living for the median human.

When we lived in city states of tens of thousands of people, it would again have been inconceivable to most that we could have nations of MILLIONS of people that again, had full employment and again, even higher standards of living.

Ditto for nations to world economy. From millions to billions, and, once more, we arrive in modern times with nearly full employment and massively high standards of living.

So when we add billions of agents and billions of robots... shit... trillions of both... why would we suspect that employment and/or compensation for humans would fall? Especially given that artificially superintelligent agents can find more productive uses for humans than other humans can, and that more teammates (robot and human) mean the team produces exponentially more and everyone benefits more?

To me it seems that while many people may choose not to work because we'll be able to afford amazing lifestyles just on investment income, there doesn't seem to be a principled reason to expect humans to become less valuable over time. The more intelligent entities interact, the more tech they leverage, and the higher total populations of productive, coordinated agents get, the seemingly more value the system produces and the higher the median standard of living becomes.

So yeah, post-labor economics might be an option, but I don't see why it's going to be inevitable. I think it's more likely that humans will have even more comfortable, more rewarding, more immersive, and better paying work than ever... into the quadrillions and quintillions of actors in our economy.

**I could be wrong!**
