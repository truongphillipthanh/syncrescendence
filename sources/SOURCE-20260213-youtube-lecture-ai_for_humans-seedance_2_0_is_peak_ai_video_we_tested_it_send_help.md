# Seedance 2.0 Is Peak AI Video. We Tested It. Send Help.

## Description (no transcript available)

Seedance 2.0 is the best AI video model we’ve ever seen. Bytedance’s new AI tool generates 15 second clips of basically anything. But what happens next? And where do we go from here?

Gavin got early access before it got locked down. We tested it with original animation, fake sitcoms, anime, and a McDonald's ad. The results are genuinely shocking - multi-shot editing, cinematic camera work, and real celebrity voices coming straight out of the model. People are making fake Seinfeld episodes, Avengers deleted scenes, and Rocky working at a fast food restaurant with Optimus Prime.

Plus two new Chinese LLMs beating American models on benchmarks, Google Deep Think scores 84% on ARC-AGI, OpenAI’s Codex Spark model, that viral AI post your mom sent you, and Kevin loses his mind building an Open Claw agent named Mr. Tibs who now requests server upgrades at 3am.

LAWYERS ARE GOING TO HAVE A VERY INTERESTING YEAR. ITS FINE.
