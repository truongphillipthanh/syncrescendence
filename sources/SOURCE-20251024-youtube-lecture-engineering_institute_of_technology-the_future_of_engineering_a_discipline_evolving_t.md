# Henrik von Scheel: Engineering in the Fourth Industrial Revolution

## Core Thesis
Engineering as a discipline is fundamentally transforming from specialized technical mastery to "integrative intelligence"—the ability to connect domains, think in systems, and adapt continuously. The Fourth Industrial Revolution demands engineers who can integrate physical and digital, work across disciplines, and design for resilience.

## Key Insights

### Fourth Industrial Revolution Characterization
- Third/fourth wave currently hitting
- Megatrends colliding create paradigm shifts
- 250-year-old principles breaking down
- Three conditions met: technological advancement, economic necessity, social readiness

### New Engineering Competencies
**Core shift**: Technical mastery alone → Integrative intelligence

**Four cross-competencies required:**
1. **Systems thinking**: See component interactions and emergent properties
2. **Digital fluency**: Understand digital logic and data architecture
3. **Collaborative design**: Work across disciplines and cultures
4. **Adaptive learning**: Continuously update as technologies evolve

**Critical insight**: Half of current knowledge obsolete in 5 years

### Megatrend Domains

**Energy Transformation:**
- Centralized fossil → distributed renewable networks
- Smart grids becoming intelligent ecosystems
- Electrification of everything (transport, heating, industry)
- Grid needs 2-3x capacity expansion while becoming smarter

**Manufacturing Revolution:**
- "Intelligent reconfiguration"—adaptive, responsive, continuously learning factories
- Mass production → mass customization
- Efficiency optimization → resilience optimization
- Product-as-a-service replacing ownership (Rolls-Royce sells thrust hours, Michelin sells kilometers)

**Supply Chain Resilience:**
- Pure cost efficiency → resilience, visibility, adaptability
- Regionalization, near-shoring, diversification
- Circular economy: linear → circular material flows
- Design for supply chain resilience from beginning

### Automation vs. Digitalization vs. AI
| Type | Application | Scope |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Automation | Non-core, repetitive processes | 60-80% routine |
| Digitalization | Complex, performance-driven | New capabilities |
| AI | Strategic, judgment-required | Learning and adaptation |

**Key principle**: Nature of activity determines appropriate approach

## Canonical Relevance
- Supports CANON-33110 Business Backbone operational frameworks
- Informs Expertise chain capability development
- Validates CANON-00004 Evolution industrial transformation thesis

Hello everyone and welcome to today's
webinar. Uh my name is Tippiso and I am
the marketing assistant from the
Engineering Institute of Technology. I'd
like to welcome you all to today's
webinar. It proves to be different as
well as exciting. Uh if this is your
regular and you always attend the
webinars, please note that this one is
going to be a little bit different. Uh
however, it's just going to be as
enjoyable uh as you all note. So I'm
going to skip the formalities of the day
uh so that we get right into the
business of it. I would like to mention
that you are going to receive a
recording as well as the copy of the
slides uh for this particular webinar as
per norm uh and you can as well as
receive a certificate of attendance.
Please note that we will send them in
about two business days. Please make
sure to monitor uh your email inboxes so
that you are aware uh where you'll
receive them. So today's webinar
presentation uh is going to be quite
exciting. we have professor Hank Vaniel.
Uh he is actually a professor and an
industrial 4.0 originator and
strategist. So he's going to be taking
us through this particular webinar. All
I need for you guys to do for me right
now is actually confirm that you can
hear and see me clearly so that when the
professor takes over the slides and
uploads his presentation uh we know that
you are able to hear and see us clearly.
As I've mentioned, the certificate of
attendance and information pertaining to
it will be shared as perm and I'll do so
at the end of the webinar. Any
questions, please make sure that you
also leave them in the chat box or Q&A
function. Uh, and then let's just get
into the business of things. Could I
please have a thumbs up uh if you can
hear and see me clearly.
Thank you so much. Much appreciated.
Thank you so much, DSA. Uh, Professor
Henrik, you may go ahead and upload your
slides as well as your presentation for
the day. Uh, and I will do uh, the
business of the day, which is answer any
questions that come through and wait for
the post Q&A session so that you are
able to answer uh, our participants for
the day. Thank you so much guys for
attending. I will see you at the end of
the presentation.
Hello. Hello everybody.
As you all here, I'm excited to be with
you together for the next 45 minutes. I
think it's a good idea you use the
thumbs thumbs up because I will ask
rhetorical questions or if you like
something, take some screenshot of it,
share it. Some of it will be new for
you. I'm a professor in economics and a
professor in strategy. I teach at two
universities on engineering and my big
passion is actually um focusing on the
future of engineering because co the
core and the heart of the fourth
industrial revolution which I will go
through I will go through a little bit
about your capabilities development in
terms of what is changing in um in your
cross competencies that you need to
comply or apply in the next couple of
years as engineers and how the
discipline is changing then I will talk
a little bit about um some of the key
mega trends that are in energy in
manufacturing and supply chain and then
I'll open up for question. This will be
um um a speedy and interactive session.
So the first element I want to focus on
is you and I will um start with that
because the centerpiece of the fourth
industrial revolutions
are you as people and that's why I'm
introducing the fourth industrial
revolution on how it's actually working
and I will come to that actually in the
middle of the fourth industrial
revolution. I will I will focus on it
based on what are we in which situation
are we now. So, do anybody of you feel
that the world is in changing in all
sides and corners?
That should be a thumbs up. If you feel
the world is changing. If you don't feel
the world is changing, that's a thumbs
down.
Do you think it's changing more than
traditional?
So can you all see my screen?
>> Yes, we can see your screen professor.
>> Perfect. Because then I'm actually just
see the situation we are in today is
that we are in something called the
third um the third the fourth wave of
the fourth industrial revolution. So
what you're seeing now is mega trends
colliding together and as trends collide
together they creating um a paradigm
shift and a paradigm shift is something
that happens rare. I know marketing they
use the term a lot but a paradigm shift
happens quite rarely and um when a
paradigm shift hits it hits the water
and everything around it changes and in
the economic revolution the biggest
change is in three different waves. So
um we are going through right now a
monitoring reset system. So we have a
monitoring system which is the central
banking system. We have the stock market
system and we have the real economy.
These three econ economies are not
related to each other. So you all feel
inflation coming. You all feel the stock
markets the richer get richer. But your
own economy in terms of your inflation
rate minimum within the last two years
your inflation rate your buying power
has decreased by 10%. What you actually
experience is there's an economic power
shift towards the east and the east is
the silk road. So that's from China all
the way over to um Turkey all that way
and there's an economic power shift that
they are the ones that are in charge.
That's 75% of manufacturing and that's
the largest um workforce and supply
chain is there. What you are
experiencing right now is that Europe is
aggressively going to war because then
in a recession there's a geopolitical
reset where everybody is trying to grow
but they're unable to grow. So the only
way out if you cannot grow is actually a
war and we have globalization reset. So
if you haven't noticed um one and a half
years ago or two years ago um MBS the
prince of Saudi Arabia he went off the
petro dollar and the petro dollar was
the only element where the rest of the
world paid the US debt down that's the
marriage between US dollar gold and oil
so everything should be bought on US
currency hence everybody was paying the
down US depth MBS decided you can buy
oil in whatever whatever currency you
want. That means when the new president
of the USA came in, the Federal Reserve
only comes in to a president to an
incoming president if they do um accord.
And an accord has only been written two
times before. So that's the third
accord. The accord is when there's a
monitoring reset system. They are
describing an age pages. Look it up at
the web on on the internet. is called
Malago accord. They are describing in
certain phases what the US will do. They
will decrease the value of the US
dollar. They will increase to get
manufacturing back and they will
implement tariffs. If these three things
are not working, they will go to war. So
the reasons why US is doing that they
had over 70 to 90 years mingled in the
world economic powers and they're losing
that power. So there's an globalization
reset that is happening a
multipleization
there will be wars for the next 10
years. So these wars are a reset system
in a monitoring system. The reasons why
I'm starting off where we are right now
is because then we go back seeing where
did we come from and where are we moving
because this is this creates clarity for
you to see which situation are we in
now. How come the richer become richer?
The poorer can barely come by. How come
all organizations are structured by
shareholder values and are raising
capitals in the fund but the last three
years there's no merchant acquisition.
there's no IPO. So these are the alarm
clocks that are shouting out what is
coming. What you see that one part of
the world is growing and expanding and
the other part of the world is colliding
together. So this is what's called the
economic revolution. It's a power shift
towards the east. So the east is also
part of Africa because the silk road
goes down to Africa. South Africa goes
to Africa, Middle East and and Central
Europe. This is the situation that we
are in right now. So the economic pillar
is the backbone of any economy.
But any economy is always based on
manufacturing or supply chain. And the
backbone of that is normally energy and
trade and how the economy works. So what
you're looking at right now is the
fourth industrial revolution, the first
industrial revolution, the second
industrial revolution and the third
industrial revolution. And the backbone
of each revolution
has actually been engineering.
engineering um in the first one um
decided on how we can use steam powers,
how we can do the assembly line, how we
can structure work and they they they
used material to engineer their way out.
In every industrial revolution,
engineers have been the guys that have
been inventing stuff, making stuff and
reorganizing stuff. They've been
changing the way we work, changing the
way materials are using, changing the
way we transport, changing the way we're
doing financing. Engineering has been
the backbone of everything in society.
So as the field is a very structured
scientific field, it becomes a bigger
and bigger responsibility for engineers
to innovate certain aspects to it. And
that's what I want to go through with
you. So as you see the energy source
that is coming here right we're also on
a crossroad because the renewable
energies
are we using since 2022
we're increasing every year our input
output of fossil oil to produce
renewable energies. Renewable energies
are not that renewable. They're not
lasting very long. The life cycle is no
longer than 5 to 10 years. if that's an
electric cars or if that's a solar panel
or whatever. So they're not really
giving the effect back that we're
desiring even though we're focusing on
it. So that's one of the field where we
need to focus on to focus to get a
better cleaner source of energy, more
sustainable water and a better way we we
we can drive most of these elements. So
the reasons why I'm showing you this
piece, the fourth indust revolution, it
looks for your picture a little bit more
like this. There are 77 mega trends that
are colliding in the fourth fourth
industrial revolution. The fourth
industrial revolutions is the collisions
of the digital world, the physical world
and the virtual world. So when I did the
strategy for Germany in 2008, we did the
strategy because we were in in recession
in Europe and the mother of Europe is
Germany and normally in strategy you go
in and look at productivity. You need to
restart productivity for three four
quarters before you can grow. That's
called organic growth and then you do
competitive growth and some other parts
of growth. And what we realized there at
this time
trends mega trends is one thing that was
there only for 5 to 10 years and you can
easily react on it. In 2008,
mobile phones, big data, internet and um
and and cloud were and and consumerism
were all colliding and so on. Your phone
when you look here was not the same in
2008 than it is today. Internet was
divided. So today it's virtually,
physically and digitally. So everything
is connected into one. And this world
has increased since then. These 77 mega
trends are divided into science and
technology trends, regulatory trends,
workforce trends, environmental trends,
globalization trends, demographic
trends, economic trends and consumer
trends. And there are normal archetypes
and archetypes is has normally an
inclination towards something. So when
you look at AI, AI has an archetype that
it can do transformation
for productivity and growth or
innovation. So it depends on what you
use it for everything it has a certain
inclination to something. So the
important element I want to demonstrate
to you here is that since everybody is
obsessed with technology the driver of
the next decade would not necessarily
come from technology.
We think it will come from technology
but it's the combination and collic
collision of all these other trends that
are making the shift towards that.
That's why the economic power shift is
towards the east. So that's a quite an
important element to it and I want to go
through some of these skills that are
relevant for that. So when you see the
fourth industrial revolution,
the fourth industrial revolution emerges
in eight evolutionary stages.
The first one is digitalization. It's
IoT. Today it's called AI OT. So
most AI projects are by design today 90%
digitalization. Digitalization is quite
easy. You do it by digital sensory
connectivity.
Then you do it by digital engineering.
So you connect devices with machines
with systems with people. And then you
go to the next level where you go
digital operations. These faces are the
faces that you go and within each phase
you use AI. So AI I will demystify that
a little bit later but that's where
we're getting at now. Right? So then we
have technology revolution technology
revolutions with robots 3D printing and
all of this. And in 2008, people thought
when I was talking about AI that I was
smoking
and they told me, Henry,
in 2016, they were all afraid that their
jobs would be taken. And in 2018,
we got the noral um networks, the neural
connections. But AI has been there for
quite a while. AI is categorization
categor classification of data. How you
use algorithms to do machine learning.
How you are um using rags and other
parts to segment data to get more out of
it. Then we have virtualization of data.
We have um augmentations of data. We
have all these pieces that we use. Today
we call it all AI but it's business
intelligence. All of this is all part of
it. Today it's under this big umbrella
of AI but AI is something very specific.
It's the automation of intelligence at
it emerges in eight different um waves.
I'm going through that with you in a
second. Then we have the environment
revolution. The environment revolution
is a regulatory force. So suddenly you
realize oops one of it is technology the
other one is technology. Then you have
one which is mainly a regulatory
revolution. And the environmental
revolution is the Paris agreement,
Coyoto agreement where all countries
agreed on scope one, scope two and scope
three. And scope one and scope two and
scope three. I was part of forming that
in the European Union is actually how do
companies pollute less
in terms of scope one direct income. So
water and energy consumption they have
and how much they pollute with the water
that come out and energy. Scope two is
how are they sourcing products, which
type of energy are they using, how are
they packaging, how are they
distributing, how they're shipping out
and all of this in one cycle. So they
can have a circular in decrease on their
pollution. Scope one and scope two are
both reporting
and scope three is the inherit send
between one supplier to another supplier
to another supplier to another supplier
until it comes out. So scope one and
scope two is a reporting element. It's a
little bit like I'm writing you as a as
a participant a sin letter like the
Catholic Church in the 200 years ago and
the I declare you a sinner and you can
only buy your way out by reporting. So
you need to demonstrate via report that
you're good but that report needs to be
validated because you cannot say that
you are net zero. You have to validate
you every year improve. So that's called
deduction where they get tax deduction
in every country. Scope three works a
little bit different. Scope three is
where I gather one product to another
product to another product together to
assemble it to transport it to ship it
until the products in Germany.
Whoever receives the product in Germany
every time it crosses the border you
have to pay for example Cban
um where you have to based on the
product either you have subsidized the
product in the country
or you are paying the tax when you go
over so scope one scope two and scope
three is a taxation element but most
companies can profit around 5% in eida
when they're proactively in it so it's
the first time regulations as a
regulatory revolution is there to
decrease the pollution that
manufacturers and suppliers are doing
and actually getting a benefit out of it
to invest more to get less pollution out
and the last couple of years has shown
that companies are doing it and it's
actually working but it's all starting
next year actively where they deduction
from it so most of them will panic so
whatever you design in products or
whatever you design you have to have
that in mind both on scope one and scope
two and scope three because they are the
regulations and somehow in this world we
have decided on some funny thing
everything has a life cycle except
regulations
regulations never die so this is
something you have to have in back
mountain and then we have the economic
revolution we just went through wave one
and wave two and wave three and we are
currently in wave two that means we will
be in 10 year period of war. And war is
not necessarily bad. War is where we're
resetting the pillars on trade,
resetting the pillars on manufacturing,
resetting the pillars on innovation,
doing something better and even more
effective. That's where engineering
really comes in. So then we have the bio
revolution that is coming. I'm going
through this in a second. the consumer
revolution going through this fusion um
science revolution and the quantum
revolution. I will go through each of
them in details because then you realize
holy macaroni
the future is actually based on
engineering
and what is changing in engineering that
engineering has the ability to focus on
this and one of it is that the
discipline is changing one of it
discipline moves out of its core
discipline to add more to it and the
other part is that we're going back to
fundamental research because part of
that fundamental research we hadn't done
really well.
So that is in summary the fourth
industrial revolution how it's moving
and I'm now moving into each of these
pillars and now a short word on AI right
so the reality check on AI is a little
bit more like this
we have symbolic AI and we have narrow
AI symbolic n and narrow AI they already
work just nobody talks about it that's
machine learning and that's robotic
process optimization
so 10 years ago
Mckenzie and Deoid, they went out to the
world preaching robotic process
optimization like this was God's gift to
mankind. The funny thing is nobody talks
about it today
because today they are selling large
language models. So what most companies
need is robotic process optimization.
It's just cheap. you can buy for 500
euros your robotic process optimization
for forecast planning budgeting for HR
recruitment for all these simple
elements 95% of AI projects fail with
enterprise information so this is where
you need to go back to the fundamentals
so AI by design
is a colonization tool you have very big
players
that are infringing on intellectual
capital stealing your information and
reselling your information. So, um,
large language models
work for consumers really well. They're
very very limited in how they work with
corporate information and very very
limit on specialization tools. So when
you look at the big providers for health
care, IBM's solution and all these other
ones, they work for journals, they work
for all medicine's information, all of
this, but they're quite limited to how
they work and structure their data. So
you need to be specialized in building
your own rats, your own machine learning
agents that are localized where you own
your own information and you use your
own mathematical models to work on this.
So a golden rule I can give you here,
don't use the large language models
where the open source is closed. use one
where you have for example Grock you can
download the mathematic matable formulas
you can reuse them on your own servers
so you have an ability to learn and
relearn and that's one of the most
important elements the way you can
structure your data in this
then you have the other parts you have
generative type AI and artificial
generative intelligence these two things
are do not exist
it's marketing that they are racing
capital for this to work. We are fooled
because they look like us but they are
not us. So there are eight disciplines
in AI and one of the disciplines is
language. So it's a replications on what
we are doing. So when I'm talking I'm
nothing else than a large language
models. I'm forming my words as I'm
speaking.
My thoughts and my words are not
necessarily connected. So this is quite
important to understand. So it reflects
something that we are but we need to
learn to author our own information and
structure our own information.
And then the big AI revolution actually
happens in the bio revolution because
most of what we are are organisms are by
design algorithms and algorithms is what
we are based on. So this will be the big
revolution that is the one that is
coming and I will go through this but I
want to highlight to you one thing here
that you as engineers need to focus on
very very much. The idea of prototyping
is core to engineering studies.
Prototyping is that you're going through
a one element and you are intentionally
looking for the mistakes to learn
something out of it.
So large language models is an easy way
to get information but it avoids for you
the mistakes. So you're not seeing or
learning the same way. So you can easily
write
uh Porter's uh value chain and you can
it will give you description but next
week you cannot repeat the same element.
If you're not written down Porter's
value chain you're trying to do it and
you failed with it a couple of times.
The learning of this does not work. So
the way we learn and the way we innovate
as humans is actually by doing mistakes
and engineering has that discipline at
the core that we're doing prototyping to
explore
where we go wrong to go back to do it
differently and that's an important
thing that we need to re-emphasize. So
when you look at from an engineering
perspective, engineering consists of
three different disciplines. Enterprise
engineering which are the principles of
design think um
um design thinking, design principles,
planning concepts, structural concepts,
quality concepts, integration concepts
and testing. So that's classification,
categorization, simplification
um of working out of the complex
elements or decomposing. Right? So
decomposing to a simple by order right
so you take a car and you split in
thousand pieces to see how you can
structure and order in a different way
together right so for this piece
enterprise engineering the most
important element you need for this is a
model of understanding so this is a
principle we need to go back to we learn
in school but we are derating from so
let me show you
a model of understanding
And I guess you have all seen it but I
just want to show it to you because
sometimes
you see something and you learn in
school but you just leave it behind.
Right? So
if you all can see the screen this is a
simplified model of understanding right.
So this is
strategic
tactical
and operational. That's a normal
organization. So within that you have
strategic, you have strategy, planning,
forecasting, budgeting and value. And
you see how they're going forth and
back. This is a very simplified way you
do it. This is a more complex model of
understanding of an enterprise. What
pieces work with what? It's the same
model just in with semantics and
ontology. So you're relating the things
together. what sends out, what receives,
what can be modeled, and what can be
changed. So,
I'm going back again to the
presentation.
Have you all seen a model of
understanding before? Just thumbs up if
you've seen one.
Just thumbs up if you've seen a model of
understanding before.
Okay, that's good. And so the reasons
why this model of understanding is
really really important because in the
model of understanding you can decompose
something, how it relates together to to
decompose it and to assemble again
because part of this is how we look at
things, how it relates, what affects it
and what do we need to change. This is
where the transformation and the
innovation comes in. And then we have
the other pieces that we have which is
enterprise modeling and enterprise
modeling.
Enterprise modeling has come in from the
element where we are designing business
models to rules information modeling. So
data and infrastructure enterprise
architecture. We do measurements. We do
process notations. Process notations are
decision cycles in information flow,
data flow, performance flow. Right? We
do performance modeling, service
modeling and value modeling. So
enterprise architecture from the
discipline of a core enterprise
architecture has moved into the core of
an how an organization works and how it
operates within that organization. So
that's also capability modeling within
services. So you structure the people
you structure how they form, how they
design, how the organiz is designed, how
financing works. So beyond organizing an
engineering tool, you actually go into
the IT elements to it. So if you want to
build a drone, if you want to build a
robot, this is where these two pieces
come together. And then you have the
enterprise architecture
which is the element of architecting the
backbone for the serviceoriented
solution information flow process flow
technology and solution flow. Each of
them are the relationship connectivity
design and physical expectations of
something. So from conceptual to
physical. So this is where IoT comes in.
This is where AI relates to the other
three. This is where these three worlds
collide together. And there's no other
discipline where this is happening. That
means in biioinformatics,
nanotechnology, all of these
disciplines, they all collide together
in these three worlds together. So even
though if you learned in school some
pieces of it, today your discipline
includes all of these three disciplines.
So you have to relate to them in terms
of how you do your ontology,
semantics,
object description of the nature. So
what is the nature of this? Is this
non-core? Is it core differentiating?
Right? How can I model it? What's the
description of it? What is the
relationship to and what rules does it
have? Right? So let me ask you, this is
where I'm just going to ask a question
to everybody. Right?
Do you all know what semantics and
anttology is?
Have you worked with it before?
So the ontology is the meaning of a
word.
And so for example, when you look at me,
I'm a dad, I have a wife, I have
children, I um
Right. So uh I'm a grandfather. So for
my children, I'm a coach. I'm a taxi
driver. I'm a supporter. I'm a
financeier. I'm a project manager.
Right? And to my wife, I'm a I'm a
lover. I'm um husband. I'm a um peer.
I'm so many things. But I'm to my sons,
I'm not a lover. Right? So the word is
that I'm a father. I'm a grandfather and
I'm a husband and I'm a lover. is the
hat I carry of what it is to be me. But
being me is the relationship to who I'm
have a semantic. So the semantic is the
relationship I have to my wife, the
relationship I have to my um um sons or
to my grandchildren. So this is how you
create a model of understanding and the
model of understanding is how you
decompose it. So you're defining the
archetype of something what is core and
you cannot split it anymore. And then
you see how's this archetype relating to
the other pieces and then you're
creating step by step. So a piece of
advice I'm doing here for myself
normally every morning I have in my at
home I have two whiteboards and I write
every
month I have two questions of unsolved
problems
and these unsolved problems I'm creating
thereby a classification
and a categorization
and the classification is a simple by
order and I looking at the archetypes
and Then I look at how they relate to
each other and then I decompose it and
then I assemble again. And it's not that
I'm going to the internet a large
language models to find a solution. I'm
training my brain to see what I cannot
see. So semantics and ontologies is a
core tool within engineering.
categorization, classification,
decomposing are the tools box you have
as engineers to see things, make a model
of understanding how you can change it,
how you can alter it and you do scenario
thinking, prototyping until you get out
to it. So this is the core tool you will
use for anything in your discipline. So
I'm sharing the slides again.
Um
I guess I was already sharing them.
Good.
So why is this important? Because the
discipline of an engineer
relates to any organizations in terms of
the trends are coming. You can see them
in a visual element in your value chain
where you do a strategic positioning.
You can do a business model where you do
strategic tactical operational in terms
of running the business or developing
the business. This is normally what
you're involved in. Then you have your
service model, your capability modeling
with people, right? And you have your
operating model, your information model,
data model, technology model, inf
infrastructure model. Suddenly you
realize, holy smokes, Henrik, you just
went through all of these principles we
have. So some of the principles are in
systems, some of them are digital, some
of them are virtual, right? And some of
them are physical. And they are the four
worlds that you are going from one
rainbow color to the other color. You're
the only one in your discipline that
does that. So you have to be really good
at moving from one piece to the other
piece. You have to have this hunger for
knowledge to constantly learn new things
and new elements because you are the
guys that need to manage strategy, the
physical world to develop stuff and
systems. So this goes forth and back. So
let's move to the bio revolution. The
bio revolution is the biggest AI
revolution that is coming and as I was
mentioning the first out of the eight
discipline in AI is language models. The
second one is AI molecular data and AI
molecular data. There is 100 times more
data out there in the world than
language models. will be finished in two
years in that the large language monster
has consumed all information then it's
just producing crap comes out with more
mistakes. So AI molecular data is our
cellular data. So the secret with our
cellular data it's the binding of it the
information that it has and it's based
on algorithms how it's binding. So as
our cells can carry data if you didn't
know it our cells are 99% empty space
the rest of it is the cellular wall and
the cellular information that is in
there. So your cell can already carry
information.
So what you will see the next couple of
years is bios so living software is
moving in that direction. Biocomputing
so bio machines and cyber physical
systems. These three elements is how
your nervous system will work, how your
DNA strings are working and how your
body, your chemical body is interacting
with the algorithms that you're
programming within these three layers.
Then you have the promise of cure is how
promise of cure is going to to that it
will be customized element in terms of
your body how you have evolved and uh
how your body can work on and that
agriculture the future of food biotech
agriculture how we have come the last 80
years in terms of we can harvest even
more it will even change far more the
one thing we have care be careful about
is that we're not using losing biod
diversity
than smart material.
Do you know why plastic is so difficult
for us?
Plastic is so difficult for us because
it's a molecular binding that is so
strong. It lets no air in. So it cannot
decompose.
So will we develop material where we can
decompose it? Yes.
Think about it. The future of food and
the future of material relates to each
other. The orange you eat today was not
the orange 200 years ago. The strawberry
you eat today is also not the strawberry
you ate at that time. These strawberries
has been polonized, polonized,
polonized, polonized. The orange was a
gift to the Dutch king, right? That's
why they love the orange colors in
Holland. So this is part of the biggest
change that you will see there where all
data and information comes from outside
to your body. Think about the speed of
how you put your data into your
information is in terms of how fast you
can transform your data from here to
here and that will change that will
change quite radically. Then we have the
bio interface. It's where our reality
changes.
So the bio revolution will be the
biggest AI revolution. So what you see
today in AI is AI language models. The
biggest AI revolution will happen in AI
molecular data. And molecular data will
be open for everybody and shared for
everybody.
The after the bio revolution we have the
consumer revolution and the consumer
revolution emerges after the bio
revolution because today when you are on
the internet you are the product when
you gather your data and web 3.0 was
always designed to come before
blockchain or AI but they were so hungry
for money that they were more willing to
have the money than protect the
consumers. So web 3.0 is still to be
built and merged in the consumer
revolution. That means you own your
information
like they are doing in Europe right now.
So you own your pictures, your
information, your medical data, all of
this you you own. So you can monetize it
later. So the privacy, the ability to
monetize what you own,
whatever information, attention you
give, you also earn money on. that is
shifting in the consumer revolution. It
changed the way that we consume and how
companies are interacting with us. So
that's the big big shift. That's why
it's the revolution after the bio
revolution. And then we're coming to the
fusion revolution. That's your biggest
revolution. That's unlimited energy,
abundant water from desanitation,
interplanetary
uh species traveling to whatever like
like these big guys wants to do. It
would be an economic reset on the
monitoring system. It would be a change
on the society on how society works
because the consumer revolution will
change society. Humans will be a
bioobotic elements where we are our bi
by by biometrics life cycle will change
based on this. I'm not talking about
living forever. I'm talking about
optimizing our intention and willpower
and optimizing our bi biology. And then
there will be a future on trans um
transportation. In all of these, they're
driven by engineers, they're driven by
you guys. So most of this is futuristic,
but it's not that far off,
right? Nuclear fusion, salt infusion,
molten view fusion, water desanitation,
it's already happening. So all of this
is not that far off, but it needs
engineers like you that are imagining
the future and inventing the future.
So my saying to this is always the more
technology we driven we become the more
human humanity we need to become in
there. So think about the following
things. Humans we are the only ones who
have the ability to adapt.
We are emotional beings and because we
are emotional beings our output is not
always both based on machines. So in the
first
two revolutions we replaced our
workforce hands
with horsepower or machines. Right? In
the third and fourth revolution we're
exchanging our brain power
for automation. But that doesn't replace
the humans. The human is still the
centerpiece of any evolution. And we
need to make sure that the human is
there. Then we come to the quantum
revolutions. I know most of you will not
really touch this because this is only
something between China and US and then
in Switzerland and Germany maybe but
it's a discipline that is is is the
science of
crazy science.
If you probably listened quite carefully
to your physics schools you realize both
Einstein and Nilso are right. So, um,
if you look, if this would be
a pen and I'm putting I have 100 million
fibers here and I put in one of it one
ticky,
where do you think the one tab comes out
here?
on the same one or on one of the other
ones or on any one.
The answer is quite simple. It comes
wherever I'm looking at. So with this
I'm changing both the past I'm changing
on where it was actually I'm moving back
in time. So there's quantum is the the
science of the freaks. That means it it
um
the high the lower down you go, the more
quantum you have, the higher up you go,
the more physical science you have. So
we need to go back to some of the
fundamental physics and chemistry that
we have and rethink the different
models. So some of these things are
already quite real. So when you see what
is proven and what has an impact today
and what is theoretically that will be
coming there right quantum
communications is already real quantum
entanglement meaning that I can sit here
and I have entangled two atoms he has
the same machine and I have the same
machines we have split the two atoms and
wherever I'm moving this it's moving in
the same direction so we can communicate
without any connection between us.
That's called quantum communications.
Then we have quantum computer, quantum
cryptologology and quantum machine
learning. These four elements are
already real. Then you have most of them
are evolving or in prototyping and are
in testing. So you can ask yourself am
I'm touching them and I'm interested in
them and I'm interested to move below
that. Right? Because when you have
quantum energy storage,
our biggest problem today with energy
storage, it actually doesn't last very
long. Lasts 5 years, 10 years. So yes,
then we use the material. But if we can
move towards a better, more efficient
and sustainable way to do that, holy
smokes, then we can really move towards
electronics elements. Electronics today
is seems like a dead horse riding
because the capital of return the
storage element the infrastructure all
of this is not proving it has it's like
machine learning in AI it has hit like a
death well and we need engineers to
bring us out of the death valley so
energy storage is a big theme we need to
get you guys to focus on and work on so
this was quite short about the fourth
industrial revolution. I think it gave
you a picture in reality. I'm taking you
very very quickly
through some you can take a picture you
will get them. They are the trend radars
I'm doing for the world economic forums.
That's why you see I'm doing that with
the different universities. You can see
which trends are affecting which
industries in which way and what are
they implementing and how they
implemented are depending on you. So
this is from for manufacturing. This is
for supply chain. This is for energy. So
there's energy generations, energy
storage and energy transportation or
getting it from A to B. So you can take
a picture of it. You will get the
presentation anyway. But this is the
shortest version I want to get at. This
is the piece I want to close off with
before I'm opening up for questions.
Right? Your discipline is under a huge
change. That means you need to learn
more technology in terms of which
merging technologies are
merging up and how can you use your
basic discipline on engineer engineering
um engineering IT or strategy and
engineering architecture you're going
across all of these fields then
financial engineering so how you do
inventory financing how you do setup in
terms of assets how you can leverage
assets You're using the same disciplines
you're using for engineering you use for
financing. Financing works silos. You
are the only one that can look I'm
decomposing it and I'm assembling it.
You look at the profit and loss and
saying okay how do we need to model the
profit and loss. This is your
discipline. The same thing with
businesses. Businesses have a certain
structure and you need to redesign
business engineering to say good should
we change the structure we have today on
inc is with shareholders should we sh
change it with a shares and b
shareholders so we instead of having a
stock market out then we create a stock
market inside the company this is where
you guys need to come in because that's
a discipline of business modeling it
where you understand the rules of
engagement of the structure of the
organization on how it works. That's why
you move into corporate engineering.
Right? So then I'm proposing that you
guys
hold the key for the future of work.
And the future of work is quite simple.
The future of work is
you have program management, portfolio
management,
um project management and portfolio
management. Project management is over
150 years old. It's nothing else than a
gun chart within that if the portfolio
management changes the project
management changes and when the PR
management changes the program
management changes. So if you change the
organizations you're moving the head
like this. The link between portfolio
management project management
and program management is often not
established. This is your job to
establish this link in terms of
performance SBOS's, performance
measurements, roles, activities, right?
If you align them together, you
strengthen the organization for
performance and output. This is your job
by the way, right? Then you need to
foster more humanentric cross
discipline. You need to add new skills
to your disciplines
and always have the human as the
centerpiece of this. And my final
element that is a strategic imperative
for you. We have been really really bad
and I'm going out of the presentation so
you can have the last slide here. All
right. So I can see your face. We have
been really really bad as research.
And I'm not blaming you guys. You
probably written some research. Most
research today, I'm a professor in
economics and strategy
is not real research.
Most are a gathering of
reports that are gathering something.
I'm so disappointed by the current
generations on the research. I'm
advising them to take some of the
biggest problems, do a model of
understanding, try to solve the problem,
but they want to go for what is what
they can get an output on and what they
are making sure that they can succeed.
the most valuable research. If you do a
research on a problem and the conclusion
is that we tried this and this and this
was the outcome that means in four or
five years later somebody in the same
discipline comes in and sees your
research and say oh he had this approach
and that was the outcome. Ah I think if
we change this pieces he's in a
different field he can leverage it. So
our research today is not based on
things that are not working. It's only
based on success stories and we need
good to go back to basic physics, basic
chemistry, rethink some of our basic
models and allow ourself in research to
focus on mistakes. Hypothesis
do the research come with the outcome
and be honest about it even if it
doesn't work because that would be the
biggest value for you guys later when
you try to build something and you
cannot see it, you cannot work with it.
That's the dis discipline that you need
to work on.
So in closing for you guys,
I believe you live in one of the most
exciting times.
We are under the biggest change ever.
And you guys that are in the sound of my
voice, the future's on your shoulder to
engineer the future, to think about it,
to challenge old principles, to
decompose, to reassess. The biggest gift
that you have been given as a human is
your ability to think strategically.
So use your time
when you have I use my time in the
morning where I'm alone to think about
things not because I want to solve
something because I want to train my
brain when I'm driving my car. I drive a
Porsche Panamera Turbo S. I'm not using
my GPS. Why? Because I need to train my
brain indirectly. Right? So use your
most powerful tool to train them. Try to
see what is not seen. The big difference
between you and AI is very simple. AI
only works from the known. When you and
I work together,
you come from one area, you come from
another area. So as we come from two
areas, you and I have the ability to
touch the unknown. And that's the unique
thing we have as human beings. So thank
you very much for your time. I think the
field that you live in as engineers are
one of the most exciting fields. The
biggest innovation is currently
happening in manufacturing and supply
chain if that's the field of your
interest because that's where products
are developed. That's where machines are
developed. That's where um the future
resides on in manufacturing. So thank
you very much for your time and my
opening up for question.
>> Thank you so much professor Hill. It was
quite an interesting one. uh today. So
you actually do have a couple of
questions and ladies and gentlemen I did
ask for questions from the beginning. So
it is going to work on a first confessor
basis. If your questions come too late
then it means we will not be moving
forward with your questions. So the
first question that I have professor is
from Charles and he asks what frameworks
should be established for regulating
AIdriven biotechnological
uh innovations and whilst you're
answering that I will upload the
information for the certificates of
attendance.
>> So I'm actually leading with Dr. Abia
Hadak the world economic formed
regulatory intelligence committee where
we have gathered all the countries
together to create best practices on how
we can regulate that I'm establishing
for the world economic forum tons of
committees I'm only participating in
three in the regulatory ones in a
manufacturing one and in the supply
chain one because I want to make a real
big difference there so um the
regulatoratory aspects on AI is
different Right. So the US has barely
none,
Europe is overregulated
and and China is um doing their own
stuff. Australia has gone baloney. They
have just overloaded everything. So
Europe is taking the following approach.
We have AI regulations one which
protects the consumer and their
information. I've been working on this.
I'm also working on the second one which
is this AI act two which is focused on
number one um children below 16 should
not have access to social media that's
already implemented in in the Nordic
countries that will come to the other
ones too number two um people under 21
should not have access to large language
models because it in interferes with
human development and number two um all
chips that are running 24/7
uh needs to have a tax model to them so
they can be able to compensate the
governments to um reskill people. So we
have a tight element on regulations. I'm
talking quite a lot to governments to
help them and support them. Um for
governments regulations is difficult.
It's very very difficult um because
first they're not technology guys.
Secondly, once they write it in law, you
need the approval of God, Muhammad, and
Allah and Buddha all at the same table
to approve that it's not relevant
anymore. So once they write it in the
pen, it cannot be unwritten. So they're
very careful to do anything. So this is
something um that is quite important
question.
>> So Tom asked a very long question.
However, I've just gone on to summarize
it. Basically, what it's asking is, is
it still worth it to learn or master a
software skill that isn't based on AI or
will AI become so advanced that the only
jobs that will matter will be a real
world handon work experience like uh
field engineering? Would it still be of
interest for someone to learn a software
or should they get field um should they
get skills rather uh in fields that are
of hands-on working?
So what you hear about AI isn't hype.
It's the big guy selling you something.
If you do AI yourself, you do robotic
process optimization on an existing
system. If you build your own farm,
right, you have classification,
categorization of data, you have
mathematical models, you do um machine
learning, you deep machine learnings
which are mathematical models that are
linked together. I can show you the
whole list. You can download them for
free. You categorize data, you censor
data, you supervise data, you you do
unsupervised learning. So the machine
produces outcomes and you optimize the
outcome of the machine. The difference
is really are you giving this to large
language models or you keeping that data
yourself. That means it's the same thing
as a model of understanding. You're
creating the data flow model of
understanding to understand the output
and input. The big problems with large
language models, they don't know how it
does it. And that's the first alarm
clock for you engineers. If you don't
understand something that comes with an
output, you step back and says, "Oops, I
need to understand how the input and
output works." Why? Because if you don't
understand it, you cannot model it. It's
actually really important. Um, so it's
the same thing if you look at the car
and says, "Whoa, why is the car moving
forward?" You decompose the machine. You
look at the wheels. You look at all of
this. So you know which wheel can I
optimize? Can I run on smaller wheels?
Which material do I need for the wheels?
Okay. Can I run besides can I run it on
water or just can only run on gasoline?
Right? This is what you do as engineers.
And that's important that you do that in
AI too. So whatever they tell you, don't
drink the Kool-Aid. You have to learn it
to understand it yourself. So AI is part
of the IT part of engineering. You need
to understand technology, architecture,
information flow, data flow. You need to
understand this because you are the ones
who model this for the business and you
model this for engineering. So you have
these three disciplines. So just saying
well large language model will work. I'm
not going to work it anymore. I'm going
to raise my fingers. Oops. You're the
only ones that can do the right thing
for us. If you understand it, you can
put brakes in it. You can put securities
bottles in it. You can structure it and
so on. I would not trust the guys that
are earning money on it.
So I do believe John's question is the
same as uh the previous question. He's
just asking is it worth it to master the
field or just look at reskilling in
another field to which I believe you
just answered. Um Elijah asked, "How can
I incorporate
>> let me ask a different
>> Is it worthwhile for you if you do
robotics and you do drones?
Robotics and drones you can buy cheap.
>> If you need to do software for robotic
and drones,
you customize the software. If you use
robotics to drive to drive over a field
and you need to sensor and connect it in
a certain way, you cannot download that
program. You need to develop that AI
program yourself. You need to write the
code yourself. You cannot ask large
language mod just to write it because
it's a very customized model. If you
have a drone going over the mine to scan
the mine and you look for gold or you
look for what you are the guys that
needs to think okay what is the
composition of gold and copper and water
or diamonds right you are the guys that
are going into that field and you need
to customize it so is it worthwhile
going there yes because AI needs to be
highly specialized in a field and who's
highly specialized you guys.
So there's two questions similar again
however one is for civil engineering and
then the other is for chemical
engineering disciplines. So the same
question is how does one incorporate AI
in either civil engineering disciplines
uh and the other in chemical
engineering. This is to answer both
Elijah as well as Michael.
So in if you go in chemical so chemical
engineering I would go in nanotechnology
biioinformatics right they're highly
chemical elements and then I would focus
on within that element you have a very
different version of AI because AI works
on language and pro probabilities of
languages but a monocular data is not
the same way so it's it's it's a DNA
string you take and you squeeze it
around like this and you squeeze it and
you put in a thousand pieces and then
you drill it out and you see which piece
relates to what in which manner what can
I model so you're not you're doing drug
discovery modeling so AI modeling not AI
machine learning so you use still
software and programming but you use it
towards something very different what is
the binding elements you can do with
this and that and this so don't think
because large language models are there
that everything in AI guys done. I rely
on you guys to saying okay this is the
noise from here I need to go down there
right
>> so uh another question um I've actually
closed the questions uh professor so
these are the questions that you have to
answer and then after that we will close
the session so Leslie asked what
disciplines can boost or can one is a
mechanical engineering um professional
or with a mechanical engineering uh
background can they adapt into these
mega trends? So he wants to know as
someone who's in mechanical engineering
how can they boost these skills and
adapt them to the mega trends of uh
today's topic.
So trends are forces and drivers that
come from outside. I think the biggest
adoption you can do as yourself is that
you develop the hardcore skills of an
engineer.
The decomposing, conceptual thinking,
physical thinking, relationship
thinking, classification,
categorization, data, all of this,
right? But that you develop yourself.
You de you develop yourself your
personal self to see at something.
And I would expect everybody of you
who's on the call that you when you look
at an apple that you look at the apple
with awe and say, "Wow, how beautiful."
You cut the apple and you see the outer
shell, you see the apple, you see the
seeds in it and all of this. And even
though you can describe the apple and
all of this, it's still an awe that
should take you as an engineers away and
see, okay, how can I create a model of
understanding of this? How can I learn
more of this? How can I see more of
this? So, what I'm asking you to do is
to train yourself to be hungry. Train
yourself to view the things differently.
Train yourself to be that each of you
are one of the guys that will challenge
old models to find something new. The
world is going through a radical change
and we need people like you that are
willing to find solutions that it will
become a smarter,
a wealthier and a healthier earth. And
that's the foundation for me in closing
to decide on how do you make sure that
this world becomes a better future for
all. It's only because everybody if they
can get smarter, wealthier and
healthier. Not few but all. So this
should be your principle as engineers.
How can you design this? I put my faith
in you guys and with a little blessings
I can give you. I hope that you um have
can have the ability to see what is not
seen. I hope you one of you guys will
find solutions for things that nobody's
looking for.
Uh, professor, do you still have time to
take about four more questions?
>> Sure. Okay.
>> So, Isabelle asks, "Are there any
resources that you could share to help
to help people rather uh in deeper
realistic and more insightful research?
As you mentioned, you're quite
disappointed uh with the material from
research these days. So, she's asking
for resources for such.
>> Oh, very very good.
So the research is today it's so
disappointing. It's so um diversity
identity driven that I mean like we the
we have got so little output on research
and we have so little fundamental
research. Some of the fundamental
elements in physics and chemistry we
have not even solved. So I would suggest
if you find one of these problem I have
20 of these problems I have on my list
go through them and says oh we still
don't have an answer to that why don't
we have an answer to that and think
about it and challenge it right so um if
if I want to add something to you right
we are in a generation
um where we're looking for about ourself
right but here's the funny part our own
evolution ution depends on other people.
When I got married, it changed me. When
I got children, it changed me. So, what
I'm recommending for you in your
personal evolution to see more to be
better at things is not only train
yourself, but also commit yourself to
marriage. Commit yourself to be
responsible for something. It changes
the way that you look at things. I have
grandchildren now and I see how they see
the world.
They look at it differently. I see my
children. I see my wife and through that
I see more. So if you want to see more
in your life, if you want to be gifted
to develop more, it's actually probably
by committing to something.
>> Um so we do have another question. I do
believe in Song is asking or before
inissor asks where do you rate
environmental engineering on future
innovation as well as growth.
>> So where do what
>> where do you rate environmental
engineering on future innovation or
growth?
>> Zero.
We are just mind masturbating.
We can do far better in putting down the
pollution. We can do far better than
this. I work with the biggest
organizations and regulation is only set
up that they're only blessed. They only
rewarded. They could do such a leap frog
but they only do that much because they
have to do every year
a 10% improvement. So companies are not
doing I do 10% improvement on polluting
less. No, no, they're waiting. Okay, I
can take the slap this year, next year
and then I do a big push but not too
much because then I have these three,
right? So we can do more.
We can do far far more on in in terms of
this, right? So our challenge with
environmental innovation is that the
people that are responsible for
sustainability today in organizations
they are people that came from marketing
that moved over to sustainability and
sustainability is moving the financial
officer needs to move in together with
the marketing because before it's about
how great they are now it needs to be
about the numbers because companies are
only moving to hardcore sustainab
ability to decrease the pollution when
it matters in the pocket.
Okay. And Cis asks for instrumentation
uh for an instrumentation and automation
engineer or engineers rather uh how do
how does it relate to the future
technology? Um I'm reading it as it is.
I'm not sure what he meant but from my
understanding he's asking how does
instrumentation and automation tie into
the future technology especially in an
era where there is AI models
>> so AI is normally used for automating so
if you look at a warehouse and you look
at an assembly line or warehouse
management and so on right you're using
it in anything which is noncore so when
you look at any object normally right
you normally look and saying okay I
should optimize and integrate
the 60 to 80% should be automated
because it's noncore everything which is
in nature this is the principle you do
in engineering first what is the nature
of this is this noncore then you
automatically know if it's non-core I
can automate it integrate it and align
it you can use AI principle into it then
you say everything which is unique in
nature or complex in nature so when is
complex in nature like warehouse
management you realize oops if I use the
same the principles to non-core I
automate it then I'm doing something
wrong I'm siloing what it's doing and
because it's complex in nature it needs
to move all the time because it's
performancedriven so warehouse
management you do digitalization
you don't do automation so
digitalization is different than AI
automation right so it's the nature
Natures what you do with it. When it's
unique or strategic in nature, you
either have risk assessment to it,
governance to it or forecast to it.
Right? So the nature of what it is
decides on how you use. So these are I'm
telling you engineering principles. So
engineering principles is also life
cycles.
life cycle of information, life cycle of
processes, of activities and outcomes.
And the life cycles decide in which life
cycle you are which principles you will
use.
So I'm just teaching you the same
principles that are in engineering.
So you're just moving away from the
theory to the practice.
>> So here is our last question for today's
webinar. Uh Charlie asks if you can
please provide info or resources for
understanding and implementing AI
modeling and creating the customized uh
artificial intelligence models. I'm
guessing that you are talking about
>> so
if you have robotic process optimization
search on the internet robotic process
optimiz I think I have the slide here
somewhere for you guys.
Let me see if I
good. I'm just sharing the slides with
you very fast. So you can see you you
will not get this one. So take the
screenshot of it. Right. So this is the
hype cycle of AI. Right? So if you look
here,
these models are nothing else than
mathematical models that you use.
So you can download them free from the
internet.
Machine learning, all these models are
free.
Vector databases, all these models are
free. If you come up here, you need an
experts to it. But this none of this is
is something where you say well Henrik
well this is rocket science. No it's not
rocket science. If you're in data and
you do machine learning you are hardcore
going into mathematics.
You're doing mathematical formulas
supervised learning and non-supervised
learning. You're programming it in this
way and this way. You can download
models free from Groc. Brock is the only
large language models that shares all
its sources for free. You can download
the mathematical models. You should be
so excited about it. You should anybody
you should not use open source anymore.
You should only use crop. Why? Because
you should support as an engineer
somebody that shares opensource
information that you can take these
mathematical models and build your own
one in Africa to say, "Oh, I like these
ones will work. I think I'm using this
for my drone solution for the props
because today you don't get it anywhere
else, right? And I must say uh Elon Musk
is probably a figure that is on both
sides, good and bad, but in this side he
does the right thing, right? Our field
is closed on AI mathematical formula and
he's the only one who opens it up for
everybody. So you should praise him from
your own form so you can use it.
>> That is it. We are done ladies and
gentlemen. Thank you so much Professor
Henrik. It was quite entertaining as
much as it was informative. Uh ladies
and gentlemen, you will receive uh a
copy of this recording as well as the
information that the professor has
provided us with. Thank you so much,
Professor Hendrik. It was a pleasure.
Enjoy the rest of your
