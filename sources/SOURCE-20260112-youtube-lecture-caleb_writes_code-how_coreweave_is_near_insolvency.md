## Description (no transcript available)

How will growing competition among neoclouds and hyperscalers all play into the factor of the AI industry continuing to battle for more compute. What does GPU and model depreciation and deprecation cycle look like as CoreWeave continues to compete with new innovations being introduced everyday?
