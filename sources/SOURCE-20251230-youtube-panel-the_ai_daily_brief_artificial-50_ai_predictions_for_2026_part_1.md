## Description (no transcript available)

Fifty AI predictions for 2026 explore model and capability trajectories, accelerating release cadence, multimodal competition, emerging world models, and next‑generation hardware like Blackwell. Vibecoding and personal software will move from prototypes into production across non‑technical enterprise functions and bespoke consumer apps. Enterprise priorities will shift to memory, last‑mile user data, data and context engineering, agent‑friendly interfaces, and quantitative ROI measurement as agentic workflows redefine knowledge work.
