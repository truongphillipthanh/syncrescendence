Every major shift in consumer tech has a moment when it suddenly becomes accessible to millions.

Now at Lightspeed, he sees AI bringing a similar leap to music, media, and everyday apps.

In this conversation, he and Garry trace the arc from the early days of social audio to today's consumer AI boom—and dig into what founders should focus on as the next generation of creative tools takes shape.
