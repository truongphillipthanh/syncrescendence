the best OpenClaw setups i've seen were built by people who can't write a single line of code...
and that's not a coincidence
when you can't code, you can't brute force your way through problems
you can't just "write a script" when something breaks, you can't fix things by yourself
so what do you do instead?
you learn to explain things clearly... painfully clearly
and that's exactly what AI models respond to best
these people spent months (sometimes years) compensating for their lack of technical skills by getting absurdly good at one thing:
turning a messy idea into a clear, structured instruction
> what do i want this to do
> what happens first, what happens after
> what does "done" look like
it goes beyond prompting
and this isn't changing anytime soon
prompting matters for years... probably until models can read intent directly from your brain through sensors
until that day comes, your ability to turn your vision into a clear instruction is the most valuable skill you can develop
the people winning right now aren't writing the best code
they're thinking the clearest
