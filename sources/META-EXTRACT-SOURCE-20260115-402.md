## Concept (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260115-402-0001
**Lines**: 16-18
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Emotional dysregulation in ADHD is characterized by emotions feeling overwhelming, fast, or hard to control, and is not indicative of being broken, lazy, or "too sensitive."

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260115-402-0004
**Lines**: 25-26
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260115-402-0002
**Lines**: 19-20
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The brain science behind ADHD and emotional dysregulation involves delayed prefrontal cortex development, differences in dopamine and norepinephrine, and the phenomenon of rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD), which can cause emotions to manifest before inhibitory mechanisms activate.

## Praxis Hook (2)

> A key skill for emotional regulation with ADHD is learning to pause before reacting, which can help slow reactions, calm the nervous system, support working memory, and enable a more thoughtful response.
