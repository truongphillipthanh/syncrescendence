## Description (no transcript available)

The next global leader is waiting in the wings — and no, I don’t mean China. India is the major power with the fastest-growing economy and the world’s largest population, and on the heels of trade deals with the United States and the European Union, it’s poised to become even more influential. I wanted to speak with Amitav Acharya, a prominent international relations scholar, about whether a new Indian century is about to be born.

01:30 - India vs. China: The race to development
03:53 - “The mother of all trade deals”
11:01 - India's “multi-aligned” foreign policy
17:32 - What is India’s grand strategy?
26:15- The diaspora’s cultural and civilizational influence
41:14 - India in 2060
