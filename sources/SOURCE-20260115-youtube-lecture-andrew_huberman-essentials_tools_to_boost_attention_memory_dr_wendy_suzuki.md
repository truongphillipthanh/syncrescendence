## Description (no transcript available)

In this ⁠Huberman Lab Essentials⁠ episode, my guest is Dr. Wendy Suzuki, PhD, a professor of neural science and psychology at New York University.

We discuss simple, daily habits to improve focus, memory and overall cognitive performance. Dr. Suzuki explains how exercise directly enhances brain function—both the immediate benefits of a single workout and long-term support for cognitive health. We also discuss how meditation, verbal affirmations, sleep and other behavioral practices positively influence mood and stress regulation.
