What's really happening when AI agents run on personal hardware and start talking to each other? The common story is that agent autonomy is a controlled enterprise affair—but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on the first real glimpse of autonomous AI self-organization:

 • Why OpenClaw crossing 100,000 GitHub stars feels like a Napster moment
 • How Moltbook became a social network where only AI agents can post
 • What Crustiferianism reveals about agents mirroring human direction
 • Where enterprise and open source agent communities are diverging

For builders watching agentic AI unfold, the deeper lesson isn't about consciousness—it's that agents reflect the structure we give them, and enough humans want to see what happens without guardrails.
