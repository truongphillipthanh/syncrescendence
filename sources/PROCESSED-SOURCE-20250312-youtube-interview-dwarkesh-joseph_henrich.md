# Joseph Henrich: Cultural Evolution and the Collective Brain

## Executive Summary

Harvard professor of human evolutionary biology explains how cultural evolution—not individual intelligence—enabled human dominance. Key thesis: the "collective brain" (population size × interconnection × cultural transmission) drives technological progress more than individual cognitive capacity. Neanderthals had larger brains but lost to behaviorally modern humans who had better cultural institutions. Provocatively: human brain size has declined 10% in 10,000 years as we've outsourced cognition to culture. The Catholic Church's medieval marriage prohibitions inadvertently created the institutional conditions for the Industrial Revolution.

## Key Insights

### The Collective Brain
"If you have institutions that interconnect your population, you can maintain more sophisticated technology." Population size, network connectivity, and transmission fidelity determine technological capability more than individual intelligence.

### Why Europeans Starved Where Foragers Thrived
"They had guns, steel tools, and all these advantages, and yet they starved because they didn't know which plants were edible or how to hunt and trap animals in that environment." Knowledge accumulated over generations in the collective brain cannot be replicated by individual genius.

### Cassava Processing Mystery
A 10-step process to detoxify cassava cannot be invented through individual insight. "The genius of the process isn't individual insight into chemistry. It's that you have thousands of people, over thousands of years, making small adjustments and keeping track of what works."

### Brain Size Decline
"Human brain size has decreased over the last 10,000 years... by about 10 percent." Hypothesis: "We've literally outsourced functions to the collective brain and our culture. If the collective is handling memory, innovation, and decision-making, then there's less selection pressure for maintaining large brains."

### The Catholic Church Effect
Medieval marriage prohibitions broke intensive kinship networks, creating nuclear families and individual property rights. "These institutions became the foundations for markets and eventually for industrial capitalism." Unintended consequence: the institutional preconditions for the Industrial Revolution.

### AGI and Cultural Learning
"An AGI wouldn't have those limits [of memory and transmission]. It could store and retrieve vast amounts of information instantly." But: "An AGI might develop entirely different mechanisms for knowledge accumulation and transmission. So it might be superhuman, but in ways we can't easily predict."

## Quotable Passages

> "When Europeans encountered other cultures—Australian Aboriginals, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders—there were often assumptions of lower intelligence. But what was actually happening was that these people had different knowledge and different skills optimized for their environment and their culture."

> "The smartness that matters now is different from the smartness that mattered then."

> "The story is: the Catholic Church wanted to consolidate religious authority by breaking kinship networks, and that inadvertently created the institutional conditions for capitalism and industry."

> "Almost every single first invention of something big that we think is important for humans was invented in Eurasia."

## Integration Notes

- **CANON-00015 (Macroscopic Narratives)**: Collective brain as civilizational lens; cultural evolution as phase transition mechanism
- **CANON-00016 (Ontological Framework)**: Intelligence as distributed system property, not individual capacity
- **CANON-35000 (Wisdom Chain)**: Cultural institutions as crystallized wisdom; unintended consequences of religious policy
- Novel contribution: Brain size decline as evidence of cognitive outsourcing; Eurasia's "Lucky Latitudes" as collective brain advantage
