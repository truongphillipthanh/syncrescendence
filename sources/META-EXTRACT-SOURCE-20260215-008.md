## Claim (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260215-008-0008
**Lines**: 50-50
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The current state of the 'lobster internet' is somewhere between Phase 2 ('Claws' Hosted in the Cloud) and Phase 4 (Verticalized Bundles).

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260215-008-0001
**Lines**: 12-13
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.40

> The 'lobster internet' describes the progression of openclawification of the internet, where AI agents become increasingly integrated and central to online activities.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260215-008-0002
**Lines**: 15-47
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.90, consensus_pressure=0.10, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.90, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.30

> The 'lobster internet' evolves through phases: 1) Hackers at Home (local, niche), 2) 'Claws' Hosted in the Cloud (browser-accessible agents), 3) Multi-Model Orchestration (focus on orchestration over model intelligence), 4) Verticalized Bundles (pre-wired workflows for specific domains), 5) Agent as Employee (agents with job titles), 6) Agents as the New SaaS (paying for outcomes, not tools), 7) Outcome-Based Pricing (agents charge per result), 8) Personal Agent Layer (persistent, context-aware agents), 9) Agent-Native Apps (apps designed for agents first), 10) OnPrem Becomes the New Cloud (secure, local enterprise agent stacks), 11) Regulated Agent Frameworks (audited, compliant agent systems), 12) Invisible Infrastructure (abstracted agent infrastructure), 13) Agent-Native Companies (human-directed agent clusters), and 14) Leverage Premium Humans (scarce skills are taste, orchestration, judgment).

## Prediction (5)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260215-008-0003
**Lines**: 24-25
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.50

> From 2026 and beyond, the 'model wars' will shift from 'who's smarter' to 'who orchestrates better' as orchestration becomes the primary driver of AI output.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260215-008-0004
**Lines**: 33-34
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.90, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Software will shift from being an interface to being an executor, with users paying for outcomes (e.g., 'an agent that closes 20 deals/month') rather than CRM software.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260215-008-0005
**Lines**: 36-37
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.90, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Subscriptions will fade as outcome-based pricing expands, with agents charging per lead booked, bug fixed, page ranked, or deal sourced.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260215-008-0006
**Lines**: 41-44
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.90, consensus_pressure=0.10, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.90, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.30

> Every major human application will eventually have an agent equivalent, leading to 'Agent-Native Apps' where applications become programmable surfaces for agents rather than being designed for humans first.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260215-008-0007
**Lines**: 46-47
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Enterprises will increasingly run secure, local-first agent stacks with private models and internal data, making 'local' a key selling point.
