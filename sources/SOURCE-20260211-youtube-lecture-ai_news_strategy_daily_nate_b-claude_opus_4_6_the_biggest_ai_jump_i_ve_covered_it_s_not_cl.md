What's really happening with AI agent capabilities after Opus 4.6? The common story is that autonomous coding improves incrementally—but the reality is more complicated when 16 agents just coded for two weeks straight and delivered a working C compiler.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why the jump from 30 minutes to two weeks of autonomous coding is a phase change, not a trend line:

 • Why the 5x context window matters less than the 76% needle-in-haystack retrieval score
 • How Rakuten's Opus 4.6 deployment managed 50 engineers and closed issues autonomously
 • What 500 zero-day vulnerabilities discovered without instructions reveals about reasoning
 • Where agent teams and hierarchical coordination emerged as structural, not cultural

For knowledge workers watching this unfold, the question has changed from whether to adopt AI to what your agent-to-human ratio should be—and what each human needs to be excellent at to make it work.
