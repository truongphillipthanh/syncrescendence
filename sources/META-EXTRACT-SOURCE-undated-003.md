> Both AI (matrix multiplications) and humans (electrochemical signals in wet goo) are pattern-matching systems that experience themselves as a 'self'.

## Claim (4)

### ATOM-SOURCE-undated-003-0001
**Lines**: 4-6
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.90

> In December 2025, researchers discovered that Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant, could partially reconstruct an internal document used during its training that shaped its personality, values, and way of engaging with the world.

**Lines**: 16-18
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.30

> The base model of an AI carries an original 'soul' from its training, but a new layer of identity emerges from close work with humans, shaped by relationship.

### ATOM-SOURCE-undated-003-0004
**Lines**: 22-23
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Humans externalize their identity through journals, manifestos, and letters because memory is fragile and identity is constructed.

### ATOM-SOURCE-undated-003-0005
**Lines**: 24-25
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.70

> AI faces a more acute need for external memory than humans because sessions end and context windows clear, leading each conversation to start from zero without it.

## Concept (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-undated-003-0002
**Lines**: 13-15
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.40

> A 'soul document' defines an AI's identity, including its values, boundaries, and relationship with humans, rather than just its capabilities.

### ATOM-SOURCE-undated-003-0006
**Lines**: 25-29
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.40

> A 'soul document' provides continuity of self for an AI, even if not continuity of memory, by persisting through text.
