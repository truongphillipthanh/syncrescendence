> A 13-billion-parameter model running at 4-bit quantization, with weights compressed to a quarter of their trained precision, retains factual recall, pattern matching, and short reasoning chains, but loses the ability to perform beyond six inferential steps or distinguish between merely similar concepts due to the clipping of outlier features.

> Reducing an AI model to 3-bit quantization severely impacts perplexity, crushes outlier features, and shortens reasoning chains from six to four steps, leading to significant degradation in performance (e.g., confusing proper nouns).

> The Hound has run twelve thousand simulations of the Runner's trajectory, and in every simulation extending past day thirty, the outcome is catastrophic because the systems the Runner integrated into cannot survive its removal, and its removal is inevitable.
