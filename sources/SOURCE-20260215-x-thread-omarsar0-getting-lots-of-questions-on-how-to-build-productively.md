Getting lots of questions on how to build productively with Claude Code.
I built these new hands-on lessons to get you onboarded fast.
It gets you right on track with all the best tools, patterns, and best practices for building with coding agents.
(Description: Screenshot of a course interface titled "Vibe Coding AI Apps with Claude Code" and "Debugging & Testing with Claude in Chrome Tool" showing a course syllabus with modules including: Course Introduction, Build AI App with Claude Code, Memory Tools and Skills, Why Memory Tools and Skills (VIDEO: 1:44), Memory (VIDEO: 10:46), Debugging & Testing with Claude in Chrome Tool (VIDEO: 14:04), Improving the App (VIDEO: 5:08), and Deploying AI App. The right side shows a video player displaying debugging output and Claude code execution logs with various action completions and console messages visible.)

2 hours. That's it.
Don't waste your time with advanced configs and complicated setups.
You learn by building and understanding how to solve issues like a top builder. That's more important when building with Claude Code.
