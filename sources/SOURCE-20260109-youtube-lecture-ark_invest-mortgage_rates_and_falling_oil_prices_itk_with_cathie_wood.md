## Description (no transcript available)

On the January episode of ITK, ARK CEO/CIO Cathie Wood explains how cheaper energy, easing shelter dynamics, and unit labor cost trends could pull inflation and interest rates down and why recent developments in Venezuela could help push oil prices lower. She also ties in China’s deflationary export pressure and tariffs, the AI/power buildout and productivity rebound, and what it all means for innovation assets—including the “digital gold” debate around Bitcoin.
