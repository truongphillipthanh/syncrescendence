# Ashpreet Bedi Thread - Dash: Self-Learning Data Agent

## Post 1 (Feb 2, 2026, 4:21 PM)

I'm fairly confident we're at the cusp of a new architecture for agents. Going from stateless tools in a loop to machines that learn and improve.

Every Agent 1.0 will evolve into this pattern.

Dash not only solves a clear pain point, it does so with an architecture that enables the agent to learn from its mistakes, layer in context as needed, and get smarter with use.

Github repo if you want to check it out: https://github.com/agno-agi/dash

(Description: An embedded information card titled "Dash: Self-learning data agent" containing the following text:
```
Here's a link to the GitHub repo if you want to dive right in.

OpenAI shared how they built their internal data agent. 6 layers of context, a self-learning memory system, and real lessons from running it in production. The best enterprise data agent out there.

I've been working on a similar agent and their architecture validates the gpu-poor continuous learning approach I've been testing.

Today I'm open-sourcing my version. It's called Dash.

Dash is a self-learning data agent that grounds its answers in 6 layers of context and improves with every run.

- Table Usage: schema, columns, relationships
- Human Annotations: metrics, definitions, gotchas
- Query Patterns: SQL that's known to work
- Institutional Knowledge: external docs, research
- Memory: error patterns, discovered fixes
- Runtime Context: live schema when things change
```

Hi @Teknium, i'll skip the core agent loop as you know that well. What im excited about (and what Dash adds) is a self-learning component that runs in parallel.

When the agent makes a mistake, it captures the fix and stores it in a learning store it can search later. When something works, it identifies the pattern and adds it to its knowledge base. Over time it stops repeating mistakes, learns how the team uses it, and picks up on what they care about.

The bigger picture imo is that most agents today are stateless tools in a loop. What I'm excited about are agents with a dedicated learning component that travels with them. That's the extra layer of context via ICL that makes them improve with use.
