_______________________________________
What's really happening when two competing visions of AI agents ship 20 minutes apart? The common story is that this is a benchmark race—but the reality is more complicated when the choice between Codex and Claude determines how your entire week changes.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why OpenAI and Anthropic built fundamentally different answers to the same question:

 • Why Codex bets on autonomous correctness while Claude bets on integration and coordination
 • How the three-layer orchestrator architecture enables hand-it-off-and-walk-away work
 • What Agent Teams with peer-to-peer messaging means for interdependent problems
 • Where the meta-skill of evaluating new capabilities becomes the durable advantage

For knowledge workers choosing between delegation-shaped problems and coordination-shaped problems, the right question is not which tool wins—it's which organizational muscle you want to build.
