## Description (no transcript available)

OpenAI releases GPT-5.2 after desperate attempt to stay on top of the competition from other frontier labs, as Google, Gemini, Anthropic, Claude, and xAI continues to push OpenAI to innovate faster and better.
Meanwhile, the hyperscaler and data center build out also faces strong competition, and it has a huge economic impact depending on how this plays out.
AI race is changing every day and model releases like this helps us understand where we stand and what to look out for as private credit is entering into the equation and cash flow based capex build out is becoming short.
