## Claim (3)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260214-015-0001
**Lines**: 2-3
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.20

> The future of automation involves a $600 box on a user's desk running their entire business logic.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260214-015-0003
**Lines**: 10-12
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.30

> The real solution for automation is to provide a smart agent with data and allow it to determine the workflow, rather than relying on nodes, connectors, and monthly plans offered by platforms like n8n.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260214-015-0004
**Lines**: 13-14
**Context**: consensus / limitation
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Current agent technology still requires improvements in web access, maturation of MCPs (Multi-Agent Coordination Protocols), and some setups still demand technical skill.

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260214-015-0002
**Lines**: 4-9
**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Using an OpenClaw and Mac Mini can replace platforms like n8n for running business logic, offering scheduled tasks without a platform, self-updating builds, self-debugging agents, and performance improvements with new models.

## Prediction (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260214-015-0005
**Lines**: 15-16
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.90, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.20

> The trajectory for automation is clear: personal agents built on individual data, running on personal hardware, will eliminate the need for current platforms once fully developed.
