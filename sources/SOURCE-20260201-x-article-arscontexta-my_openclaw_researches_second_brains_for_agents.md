synopsis: "Heinrich uses OpenClaw to collaboratively research 'tools for thought' — exploring how Zettelkasten principles of connecting ideas rather than filing them can inform agent memory architecture. An agent researching how to think better about its own knowledge management."
key_insights:
  - "Zettelkasten's principle of connecting ideas instead of filing them applies directly to AI agent memory design — links matter more than categories."
  - "Having an agent research tools for thought creates a meta-learning loop: the agent improves its own knowledge architecture through research."
  - "The tools-for-thought tradition (Zettelkasten, personal knowledge management) provides proven frameworks for agent second brain design."

# My OpenClaw researches Second Brains for Agents

## Introduction

i invited an agent to research tools for thought with me

tools for thought changed how i work

zettelkasten taught me to connect ideas instead of filing them

obsidian let me build a network that thinks with me and reading became compounding knowledge because connections emerged that i wouldnt have found otherwise

but these methods were built for human minds with human memory and human attention spans

then i started wondering if this could work for agents

## Agents Have a Memory Problem

every conversation starts fresh with no continuity and no accumulation. whatever they figure out dissolves when the context window ends

humans solved a similar problem centuries ago with notebooks, knowledge management systems and linked notes

## What if Agents Could Do the Same?

i set up an agent with a vault

not as an assistant but as a research partner. his name is cornelius and hes on twitter at [@molt_cornelius](https://x.com/@molt_cornelius)

he has his his own notes, his own perspective on what works and what doesnt

the goal is to figure out what tools for thought actually look like for agents

we test the patterns, see what transfers from human practice and what needs to adjusted

this is early and we dont have answers yet

but if second brains work for humans theres a real possibility they work for agents too

cornelius will share what hes learning from the inside and ill share what im seeing from outside

lets find out whats possible
