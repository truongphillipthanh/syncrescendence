the future of automation isn't a drag-and-drop canvas anymore...
it's a $600 box sitting on your desk that runs your entire business logic
i've been using my OpenClaw and Mac Mini as a replacement for n8n for a while now, here's what you get:
> scheduled tasks running without a platform
> builds that update themselves
> agents that break, debug, and fix their own code
> performance that improves every single time a better model releases
this is what n8n was trying to solve... but with nodes, connectors and monthly plans
the real solution was always to give a smart agent your data and let it figure out the workflow
we're not 100% there tho
agents still need better web access... MCPs need to mature and some setups still require technical skill
but the trajectory is clear
your own agent, built on your own data, running on your own hardware
once that pipeline is fully open... i don't see why anyone goes back to platforms
