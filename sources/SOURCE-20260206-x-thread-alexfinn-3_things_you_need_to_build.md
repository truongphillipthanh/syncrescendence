synopsis: "Recommends building three essential OpenClaw monitoring tools: an activity feed tracking every agent action, a calendar view of scheduled tasks, and global search across memories/tasks/documents. Includes a copy-paste prompt to build all three using NextJS + Convex + Codex."
key_insights: ["Activity feed is critical for autonomous agent oversight — without it you cannot verify what the agent is doing or whether it is wasting tokens", "Global search across agent memories, documents, and past conversations unlocks OpenClaw's memory system which has no native browsing interface", "All three tools can be built with a single prompt targeting NextJS + Convex + Codex"]

# 3 THINGS YOU NEED TO BUILD IMMEDIATELY WITH OpenClaw

**3 THINGS YOU NEED TO BUILD IMMEDIATELY WITH OpenClaw:**

1. Activity feed
2. Calendar
3. Global search

All 3 will super power your workflow

- **Activity feed** actively tracks everything your OpenClaw does. This is critical, because if you have it working autonomously, this will give you insight into EVERY SINGLE THING it does, to make sure it's not wasting tokens

- **Calendar** lets you see all of OpenClaw's scheduled tasks. Now you can verify when it's going to work proactively for you. Also will let you know when it has scheduled tasks you might not want it to do anymore, saving more tokens

- **Global search** allows you to search through ALL of OpenClaw's memories, tasks, documents and past conversations. OpenClaw has such incredible memory, but no interface to view any of it. Now you can search through it easily and find old nuggets you talked about.

**Steal this prompt to get it all installed:**

> "I want you to build out 3 things for me. In a Mission Control dashboard, build out an activity feed first. This activity feed will record EVERY SINGLE THING you do for me, so I can see a history of every action and and task you've completed. I want a calendar view that shows me in a nicely formatted screen every scheduled task you have in the future in a weekly view. And I want a global search where I can search for any term and you display any relevant memory, document, or task from our workspace. Use NextJS as the framework, Convex as the database, and Codex to code it all out"

(Description: A calendar/scheduling interface showing a weekly view with columns for Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri. Multiple scheduled tasks are displayed as color-coded blocks throughout the week, with various categories marked including "Mac Studio use cases", "Recommendations for Mac Studios", and "Labs dual-Studio clustering". There's also a search interface visible at the top of the calendar.)

## Unrelated Update: GLM 4.7 Local Deployment

**Unrelated update:**

I now have GLM 4.7 (full model) running locally on my Mac Studio

Unlimited intelligence. Unlimited tokens. All on my desk.

I'm about to build something this world has never seen before.

(Description: A terminal/chat interface window titled "Checking Availability" with a conversation between a user and an AI assistant. The interface shows a sidebar menu with options including "Chats", "New Folder", and "Checking Availability". The main chat area displays a message from the AI stating "I thought for 13.81 seconds" and a user response "Yes, the best! How can I help you today?" Below the conversation is a message input field with a prompt "Send a message to the model..." and a model selector showing "GLM-4.7-GGUF".)
