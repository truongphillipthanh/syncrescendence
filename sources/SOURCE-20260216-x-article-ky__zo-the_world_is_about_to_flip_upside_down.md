synopsis: "Founder reflects on the inflection point where AI agents eliminate coordination problems (dinner bill splitting as metaphor), UI-based software becomes obsolete (APIs over interfaces), and 99% of code is AI-written. Argues products must be built for agents not humans, and the collapse of distance between intention and execution makes consciousness itself the scarce resource."
key_insights:
  - "If your software isn't accessible via API, it effectively doesn't exist in an agent-driven world"
  - "The blank canvas problem: anything is possible with AI, yet most people don't do anything with it"
  - "We're heading toward collapse of distance between intention and execution - the real leverage is the thought itself"

# The world is about to flip upside down
(Description: Black and white illustration of Earth in an abstract space setting with a human figure appearing to float or flip above it, surrounded by stars, orbital lines, and geometric elements suggesting transformation and cosmic scale.)
We're lucky enough to witness it all.
## The Dinner Table Problem
After having a group dinner with friends yesterday, we got to a time of payment. One of my friends paid deposit for the booking beforehand, hence he paid the full amount after we ate. Then the ritual started. Everyone started taking pictures of the receipt to calculate how much they should transfer, with the tax, and tip, and service fee. Someone reminded someone else about money owed from a previous dinner. What should've been a simple split turned into a mini financial reconciliation process between eight people.
"I wonder when this problem will be solved" someone threw.
I said: within the six months, it will be solved forever. People have no idea what's coming.
In a few months, the person paying won't open Revolut or Splitwise. They'll take a picture of the receipt and send it to their agent. That agent will identify items, match them to people, and talk to everyone else's agents. I'll get a message: "let me guess, steak and coke zero again? Approve transfer of $42 to Jon?" I tap a button. Done.
The dinner table perfectly illustrates what's about to change. The point isn't bill splitting. The point is that coordination problems disappear when software talks to software.
And that's where the shift really starts.
## The interface is changing
Remember Splitwise? It's dead in 6 months if I'm right. What is the point of such an app if we can solve in realtime, without even having to be accurate with our inputs, and getting a delightful UI generated on the fly?
UI-based software is not needed anymore when humans stop being the primary user of it. If your software isn't accessible via API, it effectively doesn't exist in an agent-driven world. If an agent can't call it, compose it, and automate it, it becomes invisible.
Before AI, great software meant great user experience. From now on, great software increasingly means reliable infrastructure and clean, accessible APIs.
The surface layer becomes secondary. The composability layer becomes everything. That's a massive architectural shift.
## We are at an inflection point
If you've read The Three-Body Problem, there's a moment where humanity is recognized as being on an exponential path of growth. Then the timeline jumps forward, and the pace of progress becomes disorienting.
Today, we not only have to deal with change, but also with the speed of the change itself.
Human development was relatively slow until the 19th century. Then steam engines. Electricity. Flight. Computers. The internet. AI. On a smaller scale, the dot-com bubble was only 25 years ago. Twenty-five years ago I didn't even have a computer at home.
My own career mirrors that curve in a strange way. I started coding in early 2023. My first HTML course felt like unlocking a superpower. For two years, coding gave me flow in a way only a few other things in life do. It felt like snowboarding in deep powder - full focus, no noise.
And then, first gradually, then suddenly, it changed.
By the end of 2025, I had almost stopped writing code manually. Not because I don't like it anymore. But because it stopped being the highest-leverage use of my time. Now I plan features in the evening. I have agents running on my VPS overnight. My OpenClaw bot keeps track of my support queries, linear tickets and PRs. There's a whole team of agents helping me with product and customer success. Every morning I review, steer, and deploy the next iteration. I go to the gym while they keep building.
This is it. We're now experiencing the inflection point of the exponentially growing society, and the thought, the feeling of experiencing it gives me goosebumps. We might live in the most beautiful moment of human history, and we're here to witness it all.
The product I'm working on was in build mode for ten months. In the last two months, the speed of shipping has been almost absurd. Ninety-nine percent of the code is written by AI. That's not exaggeration.
AI builds the software. AI consumes it.
The world flips.
## Why does it matter, a.k.a will you lose your job?
**Yes**, if you're anti-AI*
**No**, if you learn to harness its power
The most important moment in the human history is exciting, but also scary for many. It is undeniable many people will lose jobs, but as a whole the society will move forward.
We might try to protect those that don't want or don't have the capacity to understand the weight of these changes, but ultimately it's up to these individuals to make sure they aren't left behind.
On the positive note, there's still going to be the blank canvas problem.
Anything is now possible with AI, yet most people don't do anything with it. What do you do if you can do anything? The hardest part of working with AI is figuring out what to do with it, figuring out which problem to solve.
Here comes the thing that will matter in the next months and years: distribution, brand, trust, expertise, taste, creativity, network effects, regulatory moats.
Intelligence is on tap, software is free. Ability to accurately pick the right problems to solve is the biggest point now.
If your job today is boring and you do repetitive tasks every day - try to automate it. Either you automate it and put everyone else out of the job, or someone else does it and makes you obsolete.
AI is here and it's not going anywhere, no matter if you like it or not.
Where to start? Download ClaudeCode or OpenCode. Ask it to help you automate something. Ask it to interview you, tell it you don't know how to do it. Turn it into your first real AI assistant.
## What does it mean for me
I started writing this to clarify my own thinking.
For the last year I've been building Fluar as a data enrichment platform, focusing heavily on the product and less on distribution. I genuinely enjoyed building, creating a product that's crazy fun to work on.
But the market is shifting under our feet. If Claude Code can generate a custom enrichment workflow in minutes, what exactly are we selling?
The question about optimising for the wrong layer is uncomfortable, although I'd like to think I'm ready. My product is AI ready. Fully accessible throught API.
### Here's what I believe is true about the future:
- **Products will make sense if they are built either to be used by agents or if they themselves are agents.** This is true because I'm already removing non-API native tools from my daily life. My OpenClaw replies to my users on Intercom while chatting to me on Telegram.
- **Open ecosystems will outperform closed ones.** The easier it is for an agent to compose and build on top of something, the more leverage it gains. That's why OpenAI (looks like they'll win this race) will buy OpenClaw within the next couple of days.
- **A personal agent will become standard.** Everyone tells me I live in a bubble, but I also lived in a bubble using GPT-3.5. Now my mom uses "Chat" every day. It might look like today's tools, or it might emerge from one of the big labs, but most people will have something acting on their behalf.
- **If your product can't be integrated into that ecosystem, it becomes irrelevant.**
- **There will be an entirely new layer of infrastructure:** agent-to-agent communication, marketplaces, wallets, identity systems. None of this fully exists yet.
This opens whole new market for making business. It's like the rise of Social Media. Maybe B2B sales will be done through Agents too (where they scope providers and negotiate prices).
**Tl;dr - if you're building, build for Agents, not Humans.**
## Something even bigger is coming and we don't understand it
Six months from now, that dinner won't look like that. Nobody will open Revolut. Nobody will calculate tips. The "optimistic" prediction is that Agents will sort everything out in the background. We'll just keep talking.
There's one more path I can't wrap my head around - what if I'm wrong not by overestimating AI, but underestimating it? There's something incredibly huge coming our way and we don't even know what it's going to be.
OpenClaw proves there's a space for a layer that makes SaaS obsolete. There is a world in which everyone has access to a perfect code, perfect strategy, perfect reasoning, perfect writing. If being smart stops being special and intelligence is on tap, where's the power? What becomes rare?
We're heading towards the collapse of distance between the intention and execution. You think - it happens.
If this is true, the real leverage is the thought, the intention, the consciousness. I just have no idea what that means (yet)
