📌 Description
In this video, Dave Ebbelaar, discusses the future of artificial intelligence as we approach 2026. He addresses the limitations of large language models (LLMs) and the potential for artificial general intelligence (AGI). He highlights emerging paradigms, such as VL-JEPA, recursive language models, and the significance of practical applications in AI. He reviews the advancements made by major players like Google, focusing on their technologies and AI interoperability. The video also contrasts workflows with agent-based systems and explores the rise of agentic coding and context engineering. Dave predicts a shift towards voice technology as a primary interaction interface and concludes with an optimistic view of the AI landscape for developers and professionals.
