## Claim (5)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-012-0001
**Lines**: 23-25
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The traditional economics of software, based on the idea that building software creates an asset, is breaking.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-012-0004
**Lines**: 33-37
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The assumption that building software creates assets, which held for fifty years due to the difficulty of software development, is now failing because AI is converting software from assets to inventory.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-012-0006
**Lines**: 43-54
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The 'line' is constantly moving, with AI capabilities rapidly expanding to automate tasks previously considered complex, such as building entire components (by 2025) and full CRUD applications (by 2026).

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-012-0007
**Lines**: 55-58
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Software that remains 'above the line' includes compilers, state-of-the-art models, operating systems, and software encoding genuinely novel algorithms or years of accumulated domain knowledge, where the difficulty lies in the understanding encoded, not the code itself.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-012-0008
**Lines**: 60-61
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The 'line' only moves in one direction, with each new model generation pushing it higher, meaning what is above the line today will likely be below it in eighteen months.

## Concept (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-012-0002
**Lines**: 28-29
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.90, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.90

> SaaS is a delivery model where software is hosted in the cloud and sold on a subscription basis.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-012-0005
**Lines**: 40-42
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The 'line' differentiates software that is still an asset from software that has become inventory, defined by what the current generation of AI can trivially replicate versus what it cannot.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-012-0003
**Lines**: 33-36
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Traditional product thinking involves investing heavily in building software, which is then amortized across many customers over many years, treating the software as an asset and subscription revenue as its return.
