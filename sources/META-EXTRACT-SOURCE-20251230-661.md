## Claim (4)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251230-661-0002
**Lines**: 12-13
**Context**: anecdote / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Robotics researchers are generally more grounded at NeurIPS because they work with the real world, in contrast to simulation researchers who may be more 'unhinged'.

**Lines**: 15-17
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The RL research era (2017–2022) largely failed to pan out because the community overfitted to benchmarks, involved too many implicit knobs to tune, and rewarded complex ideas over simpler, more generalizable ones.

**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.80

> OpenAI's reasoning team grew from approximately 12 people to over 300 as o1 became a product and required scaling for safety, tooling, and deployment.

**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Off-policy RL is unstable.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251230-661-0003
**Lines**: 14-15
**Context**: anecdote / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The 'IOI Gold paradox' refers to the unexpected outcome where achieving IOI Gold (a significant AI benchmark) did not lead to a perceived 'solution' of AI or a major societal shift, despite earlier expectations.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251230-661-0006
**Lines**: 23-26
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Cursor's approach to continual learning involves policy updates every two hours, product and ML teams working closely together, and integrating the entire software engineering workflow (code, logs, debugging, DataDog) within the product to keep engineers in the loop.

## Praxis Hook (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251230-661-0001
**Lines**: 7-9
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> To ensure RL models generalize beyond their training distribution, economically useful tasks must be brought 'into distribution' by co-designing products and models.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251230-661-0009
**Lines**: 31-32
**Context**: method / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Cursor uses two-day work trials instead of whiteboard interviews for hiring.

## Prediction (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251230-661-0007
**Lines**: 27-30
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.90, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.40

> The next paradigm shift in AI will be 'continual learning with infinite memory,' where models learn from an experience once (e.g., a bug, a user mistake) and store it permanently in their weights, leveraging the capacity from trillions of pretraining tokens.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251230-661-0010
**Lines**: 33-36
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The vision for Cursor is to automate software engineering as a process, co-design products so the entire workflow (writing code, checking logs, debugging, iterating) is in-distribution for RL, and create models that never repeat the same mistake.
