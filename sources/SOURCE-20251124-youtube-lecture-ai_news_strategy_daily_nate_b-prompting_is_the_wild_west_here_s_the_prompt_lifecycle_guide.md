________________________________
What’s really happening inside prompt engineering and the full lifecycle behind it?
The common story is that prompting is just writing clever text — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on the real prompt lifecycle:
• Why intent formation is the missing first stage
• How LLMs help shape, version, and test high-leverage prompts
• What separates individual tinkering from production-grade evaluation
• Where AI agents and deployment workflows demand rigorous prompt tooling
