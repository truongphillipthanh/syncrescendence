# How I Use Clawdbot to Run My Business and Life 24/7

## Description (no transcript available)

I sit down with Kitze to unpack how he uses Clawdbot (now known as OpenClaw) as a personal OS that runs across Discord, Telegram, and other chat surfaces. We walk through his one-gateway setup, persona-based bots, and the way he structures channels and threads to manage customers, home logistics, and engineering work. We also dig into the self-learning angle: giving an agent shell and network access so it can discover devices, build dashboards, and automate workflows end to end. We close with a lightning round of concrete examples you can adapt across your own life and business.

Key Points

* I treat Clawdbot like a gateway that routes the same core agent into many persona shells for distinct jobs
* I keep work organized via Discord sections, channels, and threads so agent output stays searchable
* I lean on shell and network access to let the agent discover devices and ship automations that span apps, NAS, and smart home
* I use stronger models for high-trust surfaces like email and credentials, and I scope access gradually
* I prototype interfaces that turn prompts into parameterized forms so workflows stay reusable and fast

Numbered Section Summaries

1. The Personal OS Premise
I frame the episode around practical Clawdbot use cases and bring Kitze in to show his day-to-day setup. We move quickly from concept to real workflows you can copy.
2. One Gateway, Many Personas

Kitze describes running a single Clawdbot gateway that connects to multiple front ends like Discord and Telegram. Each persona carries its own skills, tone, and scope so conversations stay focused.
3. Persona Playbooks For Real Life

We go through examples like Guilfoyle for engineering, Kevin for accounting, Dr Cox for health analysis, and Darlene for home management. The separation routes tasks to the right context and keeps each agent aligned to its job.

4. Discord As A Control Panel
I ask why Discord beats a single chat thread, and Kitze shows how sections and channels create a map of work. Threads function as temporary tasks or skills in progress, while channels serve as durable hubs.

5. Customer Support Through Threads And Sub-Agents
Kitze describes scraping or fetching signals from email and DMs, then spawning customer threads with summaries and action plans. A main channel stays the command layer while sub-agents process individual customers in parallel.

6. Self-Learning Through Shell And Network Access
We talk through how an agent can find printers, cast dashboards, and discover devices through Home Assistant and the local network. Kitze shares examples like printing ASCII art, casting screens, and generating dashboards for TVs and e-ink displays.

7. High-Leverage Use Cases: From Captcha To Wearables
We run a rapid tour: AntiCaptcha as a backstop for automations, a programmable ring as a voice-input interface, and TRMNL as a life OS display surface. We also cover home presence sensors and context injection so the assistant gets room-level state.

8. Prompt Products And The Wrap
Kitze shows Spellbook, a prompt organizer that turns templates into variable-driven forms users fill out. I wrap by pointing people toward Kitze’s work and his community for deeper tinkering.
