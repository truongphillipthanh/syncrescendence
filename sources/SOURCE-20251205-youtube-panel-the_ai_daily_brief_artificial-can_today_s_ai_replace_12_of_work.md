## Description (no transcript available)

Project Iceberg's Iceberg Index maps skill-centered AI exposure and finds roughly 11.7% overlap with US wage-earning skills. The overlap concentrates in software and hidden cognitive tasks, and the index measures technical skill overlap rather than predicting job losses. Anthropic's internal data shows 60% cloud-code usage with a reported 50% productivity boost, rising task delegation, concern about deep-skill atrophy, and broader political acrimony amid uncertain adoption timelines.
