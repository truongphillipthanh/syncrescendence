## Description (no transcript available)

Ford just announced a $19.5 BILLION write-down on their EV business — one of the largest impairments in corporate history. CEO Jim Farley literally said larger EVs will never make money, so they're pivoting back to gas and hybrids. This isn't just Ford losing money. This is legacy auto admitting defeat.

Key points:
• Why Ford's $19.5B write-down is historic
• What "larger EVs will never make money" really means
• The bigger implications for the entire auto industry

Ford just took a $19.5 billion write-down on their EV business. One of the largest impairments in corporate history. Their CEO literally said larger EVs will never make money, so they're pivoting back to gas vehicles and hybrids.

This isn't just Ford losing money on electric vehicles. This is Ford accepting defeat on autonomy, robotaxis, and the entire future of transportation. Retreating from EVs in 2025 means admitting you have no path to fully autonomous vehicles and no viable business model for 2035.

Ford lost $13 billion on EVs since 2023 alone. They're canceling the F-150 Lightning, which was supposed to answer the Cybertruck. The CEO says there's more certainty in hybrids and extended range vehicles with gas engines. But what good is certainty about the wrong thing?

This was completely predictable. Ford and legacy automakers built their EV strategy on a broken assumption: take existing vehicle platforms, add batteries and electric motors, and profit using current manufacturing infrastructure. That never works.

Tesla built everything from the ground up around EVs. They designed battery packs as structural elements, vertically integrated from battery cells to software to charging infrastructure. Ford retrofitted electric powertrains into combustion engine vehicles and acts shocked it doesn't work economically.

Tesla makes billions yearly in EV profits while everyone else loses tens of billions. Legacy automaker margins are terrible because supply chains, manufacturing processes, and dealer networks weren't built for EVs.

Ford's hybrid pivot might work for three to five years, but hybrids are a dead end. You're maintaining two powertrains with all the complexity, and you're not solving for the future: full autonomy.

Full autonomy at scale requires EV platforms. No robotaxi fleet runs on hybrids profitably. Maintenance costs and reliability issues...

I worked at Tesla starting from 2017 thru 2021. I spent most of my time in the distribution and supply chain organizations in leadership positions.

Before Tesla, I was a Director of Business Intelligence and Pricing at the largest Pet Food & Supply distributor in the US, Phillips Pet Food & Supplies. My wife and I also owned a small business in Bethlehem, PA between 2016 and 2019.

I have been a shareholder of Tesla since 2012 and currently own Tesla stock. Nothing I say constitutes as investment or financial advice.

My thoughts are my own and are not representative of everyone who currently works, or has worked at Tesla, Phillips, or any other company or organization I discuss on this channel.
