## Claim (5)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260220-007-0001
**Lines**: 8-9
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The solution to enabling autonomous agents to maintain continuity over time is not complex, but rather lies in using primitives.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260220-007-0002
**Lines**: 12-16
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> All the necessary components for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) already exist, including models that can reason, plan, code, analyze data, converse, use tools, browse the web, and run multi-step workflows.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260220-007-0006
**Lines**: 48-55
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Simpler, more flexible blocks are superior to a proliferation of specialized blocks, as evidenced by the human brain's use of a few flexible systems (episodic, semantic, procedural memory) to handle diverse cognitive tasks.

**Lines**: 59-62
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The most effective cognitive structure for LLMs is one they already recognize, such as plain file structures, organized text, and key-value metadata, because they were trained on billions of documents using these formats.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260220-007-0009
**Lines**: 62-66
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Developing a general and rigorous memory substrate for agents requires more minds than a small team possesses, due to the enormous questions involved in cognitive architecture, memory persistence, and temporal reasoning.

## Concept (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260220-007-0003
**Lines**: 17-24
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The missing piece for AGI is not intelligence itself, but 'continuity' – the ability for an intelligence to persist, accumulate, and compound what it already knows over time, rather than operating like a brilliant mind with total amnesia.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260220-007-0004
**Lines**: 27-29
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> A 'primitive' is defined as the simplest piece of structure that retains value on its own, acting as a single building block that can combine with others to form larger systems.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260220-007-0005
**Lines**: 31-44
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Cognition requires five primitives: remembering things as structured, retrievable pieces with context; connections between memories; a sense of time to distinguish urgent from irrelevant information; agency to act on knowledge; and continuity to pick up where it left off.

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260220-007-0008
**Lines**: 60-70
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.10, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.50

> A small team is researching a general, framework-agnostic, and model-agnostic memory substrate for all agents, inviting collaborators to join their private Discord to work through primitives, schemas, and open questions.
