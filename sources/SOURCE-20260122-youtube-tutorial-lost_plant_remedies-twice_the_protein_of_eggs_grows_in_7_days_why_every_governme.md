## Description (no transcript available)

Twice The Protein Of Eggs. Grows In 7 Days. Why Every Government Wants It Gone.

They call it pond scum. NASA calls it the perfect space crop.
Duckweed contains 45% protein by dry weight. Eggs contain 12%. Beef contains 26%. This tiny floating plant beats them all—and doubles in quantity every 48 hours.
One square meter of water. Thirty days. Enough complete protein to feed a person for a month.
No soil. No fertilizer. No tractors. No labor. Just water and sunlight.
Southeast Asia has cultivated it for 3,000 years. NASA studied it for space missions. The World Bank called it the most resource-efficient protein source available to humanity.
So why is it illegal to grow commercially in 37 U.S. states?
Why is it classified as a "nuisance species" instead of a food crop?
Why have you never seen it in a grocery store?
The answer involves a $400 billion animal feed industry and regulations that conveniently protect profit margins over food security.
In this video:

The exponential math that makes duckweed 140x more efficient than soybeans
NASA's research on the "perfect space crop"
How Bangladesh turned sewage into fish protein for less than $0.10/kg
Why regulations ban commercial cultivation but not backyard growing
How to start your own protein production system for under $20

→ NASA Advances in Space Research (1985)
→ Rutgers University amino acid analysis (2009)
→ University of Jena human feeding trials (2014)
→ World Bank protein efficiency review (2019)
The global food system says protein is expensive. A plastic tub and two weeks says otherwise.
