# ARK Robotics Research | 2025 Year-End Review

## Description (no transcript available)

ARK’s Sam Korus shares a year-end update on robotics, examining what’s changed since the release of "Big Ideas 2025" earlier this year.

Big Ideas 2025: ark-invest.com/big-ideas-2025

Key highlights from this video include:
• The long-term thesis of decoupling physical labor from economic output
• The rise of embodied AI and generalizable humanoid robots
• A potential $26 trillion global revenue opportunity across household and manufacturing robotics
• Why task-level automation is unlocking near-term adoption

Korus also discusses how robotics has historically created new industries rather than eliminated work, the growing pace of innovation across leading players, and why the trends outlined remain firmly intact as we look ahead to 2026.

"Big Ideas 2026," coming soon.
