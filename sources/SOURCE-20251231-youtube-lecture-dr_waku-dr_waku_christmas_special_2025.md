## Description (no transcript available)

I'm back, starting with this 2025 Christmas special video. I discuss what I have been up to this year, and the reasons for taking a bit of a break the last few months.

I have a new job in AI safety, and I will be adjusting the content of the channel slightly towards an AI safety focus. I will try to make it engaging for all of my existing audience, let me know if it is not. I am also starting a new YouTube channel for shorts, called Steering the Frontier. 

I am trying to encourage my community in several different ways, including by continuing group calls on discord. I am also engaging in mentorship more and more frequently now; ask if you're interested. See you at some conferences, perhaps, haha.
