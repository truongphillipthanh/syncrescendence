## Description (no transcript available)

AI is beginning to change how science gets done. 

Head of OpenAI for Science Kevin Weil and OpenAI research scientist Alex Lupsasca talk about the early signs of acceleration researchers are seeing with GPT-5—from surfacing literature across fields and languages, to speeding up complex calculations, to designing follow-up experiments. 

They unpack what’s possible today, what doesn’t work yet, and why the next few years could reshape the trajectory of scientific progress across physics, math, biology and beyond.
