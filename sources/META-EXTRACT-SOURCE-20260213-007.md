**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.40, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The horseshoe theory applies to AI risk, where 'Doomers' (e.g., Yudkowsky, Soares) who fear AGI will kill everyone, and 'accelerationists' (e.g., Guillaume Verdon) who believe AGI is necessary for survival, converge on the idea that AGI is inevitable or essential.
