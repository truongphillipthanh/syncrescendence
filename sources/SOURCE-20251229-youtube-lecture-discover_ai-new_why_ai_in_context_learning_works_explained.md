# NEW: Why AI In-Context Learning Works (Explained)

## Description (no transcript available)

How exactly does In-context Learning happen? What are the exact learning algorithms inside the transformer layers that activate what we call activations? What is their relation to the fine-tuning with optimized weight tensor structures? Why are they correlated? 

Is ICL just another form of Fine-tuning as a Rank-1 update function in the weight tensor space? Could it be that simple? Did we design the transformer architecture with open degrees of freedom, we are just now discovering?
