David Friedberg, co-host of the All-In podcast, visits Network School. We discuss the rise of the Internet over the state in the West, China's increasing dominance in the physical world, the long-term impact of the New Deal, the economic realities driving social division, the need for deregulation, and the drive for new American Freedom Cities.
