# 50 days with OpenClaw: The hype, the reality & what actually broke

**Channel**: VelvetShark
**Published**: 2026-02-20
**Duration**: 47m 58s
**URL**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ1mKAWJPr4

## Description (no transcript available)

This is my 50-day OpenClaw review after running a self-hosted AI agent every single day.

In this video I show:
- 20 real OpenClaw use cases from daily life
- Discord channel architecture + per-channel model routing
- Markdown-first workflows with Obsidian + semantic search
- Background automations and health checks
- Server DevOps and coding from phone
- Cost optimization and multi-model routing
- What actually breaks (memory, compaction, browser automation)
- Security risks and how I mitigate them

This is not a first-week impression. I made the setup video featured in the official OpenClaw docs. I built Clawdiverse.com. I created a skill on ClawHub. This is a real 50-day field report.

All prompts for every workflow (copy-paste ready):
