## Description (no transcript available)

AI is often framed as magic or menace. In this talk, Dr Chris Meah demystifies it, explores what it means now and for the future, and asks a simple question: "Will AI kill us all?". It explores the courageous path for developing AI - a hopeful, grounded journey to building an AI-enabled future that makes us more human, not lesser beings. Dr Chris Meah is an AI expert, educator, and social entrepreneur, best known as the Founder and CEO of School of Code, a free national bootcamp that helps people from all backgrounds launch careers in technology. A first-class graduate in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, he went on to complete a PhD applying AI and computer vision to interdisciplinary research across physics, chemistry, and biomedicine.

Chris created a free online coding platform used by over 500,000 learners and founded School of Code to tackle the UK’s digital skills gap. The programme has since scaled nationally, helping thousands enter tech careers and shaping government policy 

An award-winning innovator, Chris has been named Digital Leader of the Year, Small Business Entrepreneur of the Year, and one of the UKTech50 most influential people. He continues to advise on AI strategy, inclusion, and the future of work helping leaders align vision, culture, and capability to seize the opportunities of AI. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx
