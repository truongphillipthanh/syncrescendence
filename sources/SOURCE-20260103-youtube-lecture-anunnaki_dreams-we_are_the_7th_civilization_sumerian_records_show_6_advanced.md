## Description (no transcript available)

What if we are not the first advanced civilization on Earth?
What if the history we’ve been taught is only the latest chapter in a much older cycle?

In this History For Sleep episode, we explore a haunting idea hidden within ancient Sumerian records: that our civilization may not be the first — or even the second — but part of a long sequence of advanced societies that rose, collapsed, and were forgotten.

We begin with a small clay prism in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford — the Weld-Blundell Prism — which records kings ruling for tens of thousands of years before a great flood swept the world clean. As the list continues, reign lengths shrink, lifespans shorten, and something essential appears to be lost. Not abruptly, but gradually.

From there, we move slowly through global traditions that echo the same pattern:
the Hindu Yugas, the Greek Ages of Man, worldwide flood myths, and the archaeological anomalies that challenge a strictly linear view of history. Across cultures that never met, the same story appears again and again — long ages before catastrophe, followed by rebuilding in a diminished world.

This is not a fast documentary.
It’s a calm, immersive journey designed for rest, reflection, and deep listening. You don’t need to watch closely. Let the visuals fade into the background as the story unfolds gently, like sediment settling after a flood.

Were these ancient numbers symbolic — or memories?
Did civilizations exist before the ones we know?
And if history moves in cycles, where are we now within that pattern?

Let the ideas drift. Let the day dissolve.
This story isn’t here to convince — only to open a door.

If this exploration resonates with you, a gentle like helps other wanderers find these quiet journeys.
And before you drift off, tell us — where in the world are you listening from tonight, and what time is it there?

Subscribe for more long-form, calming explorations into ancient texts, forgotten histories, and the questions humanity has been asking since the beginning.
