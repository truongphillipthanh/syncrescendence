## Description (no transcript available)

Datacenter policy and rising electricity costs are driving 2026 campaign fights over affordability and prompting presidential pressure on Big Tech to cover local utility impacts. Microsoft unveiled a five-part community-first plan to pay local utility equivalents, cut water use, create jobs, increase tax revenue, and fund AI training and nonprofits. Chip export controls, possible bans on NVIDIA H200 shipments, major chip startup fundraising, and OpenAI's acquisition of Torch underscore geopolitical and market tensions around AI and healthcare data.
