> To set up OpenClaw for under $20/month, launch an AWS EC2 instance with Ubuntu OS, c7i.large instance type, and at least 20 GB storage. Create an RSA key pair (.pem for Mac/Linux, .ppk for Windows) and configure network settings to allow SSH traffic and custom TCP on port 8789. After launching, connect to the instance via the browser terminal, install OpenClaw using the command from openclaw.ai, and complete the onboarding by selecting a model provider (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI), entering an API key, choosing a model (e.g., Claude Opus 4.5), and selecting a communication method (e.g., Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, terminal, web UI).
