## Description (no transcript available)

GPT-5.2 debuts as a professional-focused model, boosting performance on spreadsheets, presentations, coding, long-context reasoning, and multi-step projects. Benchmark results highlight large gains on OpenAI's GDPVal metric and coding tests, plus lower hallucination rates and robust 256K context handling. Pro tier emphasizes deeper but slower reasoning, and the release arrives alongside an OpenAI–Disney partnership while signaling continued compute scaling.
