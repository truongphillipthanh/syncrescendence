## Description (no transcript available)

The Genesis Mission establishes a Manhattan Project–scale national AI science program to centralize federal datasets, train scientific foundation models, and build a closed-loop AI experimentation platform using DOE supercomputers. Amazon pledged up to $50 billion to expand AWS supercomputing capacity for classified and unclassified government AI work, and Meta is exploring installing Google's TPUs as chip competition with NVIDIA intensifies. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman hinted at a consumer AI device built around total contextual awareness with a potential two-year timeline while keeping features deliberately vague.
