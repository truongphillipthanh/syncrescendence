## Description (no transcript available)

*🚀 Get the Clone to Scale methodology:* https://labs.firstmovers.ai/courses/clone-to-scale

*Google's Gemini 3 Flash just destroyed the AI playbook.* This "budget" model beats Claude Sonnet 4.5, matches Gemini 3 Pro flagship performance, and scores 78% on coding benchmarks—while being 3X faster and completely FREE.

*The Insane Benchmarks:*
✅ 90.4% on GPQA Diamond (PhD-level reasoning)—frontier model territory
✅ 78% on SWE-bench Verified—BEATS Gemini 3 Pro on coding
✅ 81.2% on MMMU Pro—matching premium multimodal performance
✅ 3X faster than Gemini 2.5 Pro at Flash-level pricing ($0.50/million input tokens)

*What This Means:*
Pro-level intelligence at Flash speed and cost. Companies like JetBrains, Bridgewater, Figma, and Cursor already using it for production systems. Analyze videos, extract insights, build content strategies in seconds. Record lectures, get custom quizzes. Describe apps, build working prototypes—no coding required.

This is the automation cliff. Not 2027—NOW. While others figure out what to pay for, First Movers are already building empires with free frontier AI.
Exclusive: I sat down with Robby Stein (VP Product Management, Google Search) to break down what this means for content creators and businesses.
