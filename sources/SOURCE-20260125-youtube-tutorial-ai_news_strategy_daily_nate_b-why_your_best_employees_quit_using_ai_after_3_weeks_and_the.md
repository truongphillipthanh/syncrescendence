_______________________
What's really happening with AI adoption inside enterprises? The common story is that employees need better prompting skills—but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why 80% of workers abandon AI tools after the first three weeks:

 • Why the skills that predict AI success are management skills, not prompting
 • How BCG and Harvard found AI users performed worse on tasks outside its frontier
 • What separates Centaur and Cyborg work patterns for different contexts
 • Where organizations must invest to close the 201 training gap

For teams serious about upskilling with AI, the unlock isn't more tool training—it's building the judgment layer that makes those tools reliable.
