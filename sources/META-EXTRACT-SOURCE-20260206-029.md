### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-029-0001
**Lines**: 6-6
**Context**: prediction / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Agents are not going to be like chatbots; they are going to be like programming languages come alive.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-029-0003
**Lines**: 13-14
**Context**: consensus / limitation
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Context is still the bottleneck for current agent architectures, as all tool call inputs and outputs must pass through the input.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-029-0004
**Lines**: 16-20
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Models like CodeAct, Code Mode, and Claude Code provide access to a REPL (Read Eval Print Loop), allowing models to simulate computer environments or computer users.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-029-0005
**Lines**: 22-24
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.70

> RL with verifiable rewards makes computer environments ideal for models to learn, as the success of code execution provides clear feedback.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-029-0006
**Lines**: 26-28
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Post-training incorporating computer use, shell environments, and bash tools has led to models that can predict computer behavior in response to complex programs and commands, effectively creating 'computers that can use themselves'.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-029-0007
**Lines**: 30-33
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> In current agent systems, the computational environment provides an 'ontologically hard reality' of files, folders, and programs that persists, reducing the human user's role as the sole environment.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-029-0010
**Lines**: 44-48
**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.90, consensus_pressure=0.10, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> A recursive language model built in TypeScript processed over 6 million tokens without context degradation, demonstrating that sub-agents can send variables without reading their contents, effectively creating an infinite context window.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-029-0002
**Lines**: 10-11
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.90, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.80

> The current working definition of an agent for most people is "a language model in a loop with some tools," based on the ReAct paradigm.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-029-0008
**Lines**: 36-37
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.90, consensus_pressure=0.10, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The Recursive Language Model (RLM) architecture proposes eliminating the traditional 'chat' interface, instead treating the user as a function within the computer and placing the agent inside the computer.

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-029-0009
**Lines**: 39-42
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The RLM hooks the language model directly to a REPL, passing context as a variable, allowing the LLM to operate on large documents or memories and call the human user or sub-LLMs.

## Prediction (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-029-0011
**Lines**: 50-51
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.90, consensus_pressure=0.10, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.90, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Future agents will feel less like individual entities and more like 'councils, senates, hive minds' composed of many communicating minds, moving beyond the current 'user,' 'assistant,' and 'tool' model.
