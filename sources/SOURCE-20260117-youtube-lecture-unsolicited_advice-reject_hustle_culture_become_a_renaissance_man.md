There has been much talk recently about the concept of a "Renaissance Man". Friend of the channel @ParkerNotes recently talked about it on his channel, and it got me thinking. So today, I want to talk about one of my favourite thinkers in history - Michel de Montaigne, and how he embodied the archetype of the Renaissance man.
