> Opus 4.6 demonstrates better reasoning and use of memory than Gemini 3.1 Pro and solves more levels.

**Lines**: 30-31
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Models shouldn't need a memory or the previous state and action, as that information should be in context and weights.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260220-006-0007
**Lines**: 31-32
**Context**: consensus / limitation
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Models currently have small context windows and no continual learning, necessitating the use of harnesses with memory.

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260220-006-0004
**Lines**: 15-19
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The system prompt for an agent in an abstract 2D graphics game environment should explain that it needs to solve puzzles within an allowed action budget, will see its own modifiable memory, previous state, previous action, current state, and available actions on each turn, and must follow a JSON response format.

## Prediction (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260220-006-0002

**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Current and future models will be able to solve ARC-AGI-3, given that they have access to a harness with simple memory.
