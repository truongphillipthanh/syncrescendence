synopsis: "Essay arguing that 'local AI' today is mostly about giving models OS-level access to transfer more context to cloud inference, but intelligence is about to diffuse to the edge just as computing did in the 80s-90s. Discusses the rent vs own tradeoff for inference and the coming dance of edge and cloud compute."
key_insights: ["Current 'local AI' is a misnomer — it mostly means giving cloud models more local context, not running intelligence at the edge", "Intelligence will diffuse to edge devices following the same pattern as computing's mainframe-to-PC transition", "Consumer GPU capability is rapidly closing the gap with frontier models, enabling true edge inference"]

# (essay) Life At The Edge

"Local AI" today is mostly about giving models OS-level access so that more files and context can be transferred to the cloud for inference. But intelligence is about to diffuse to the edge just as computing did in the 80s and 90s

Some thoughts on rent vs own for inference, Apple events becoming great again, God models, and the coming dance of edge and cloud

(Description: EPOCH AI line graph chart titled "GPGA-Diamond accuracy" showing 100% accuracy comparison over time from July 2023 to July 2025. Two main trend lines shown:
- Blue/cyan line labeled "Frontier models" with markers for: GPT-4, Grok-4, o1-mini (high), EXAONE 3.0, Qwen3 32B
- Pink/magenta line labeled "Open models on a consumer GPU" with markers for: GPT-3.5, Phi-3, Mistral 7B
- X-axis: Release date (July 2023 through July 2025)
- Y-axis: Accuracy percentage (0% to 100%)
- Legend indicates "Top-1 models" and "Other models"
- RTX 4090 Era (≤ 288 models) and RTX 5000 Era (≤ 408 models) marked on chart)
