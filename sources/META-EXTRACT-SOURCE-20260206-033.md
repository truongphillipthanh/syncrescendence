> OpenAI is approaching retooling teams towards agentic software development by aiming for two goals by March 31st: (1) making interaction with an agent the primary tool for technical tasks, and (2) ensuring agent utilization is explicitly safe and productive enough to not require additional permissions for most workflows.
