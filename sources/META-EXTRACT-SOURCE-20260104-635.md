## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260104-635-0005
**Lines**: 36-37
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Organizations should build deliberate skill trees around separating generation from decisioning to achieve 10X speedups in the age of AI.

## Prediction (1)
