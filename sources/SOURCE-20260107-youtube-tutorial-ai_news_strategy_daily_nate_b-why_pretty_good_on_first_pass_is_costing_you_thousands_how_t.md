What's really happening with AI agents that claim they're done when they're not? The common story is smarter models solve this problem — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why Ralph Wiggum is changing how we think about AI agent reliability:
-Why Claude Code's biggest weakness is saying it's finished prematurely
-How a simple eval loop forces LLMs to converge on correctness
-What workflow-shaped evaluations mean for non-technical knowledge work in 2026
-Where the bottleneck is shifting from model capability to agentic harness design

Chapters:
00:00 Ralph Wiggum: The Claude Code Plugin Everyone's Talking About 
01:00 Why AI Agents Say They're Done When They're Not 
02:27 How Ralph Forces Models to Converge on Correctness 
04:07 The Anti-Lying Instructions That Make Ralph Work 
06:09 Why Agent Metrics Are Shifting from First Pass to Convergence 
07:30 Ralph's Implications Beyond Engineering in 2026 
09:14 Workflow-Shaped Evaluations for Non-Technical Work 
11:34 Why Knowledge Workers Need to Define "Done" Better 
13:00 The Optimistic Truth: You Can Buy Correctness with Iteration

The shift for operators and knowledge workers is that 2026 belongs to people who can define what done looks like clearly enough that agents can iterate toward it autonomously.
