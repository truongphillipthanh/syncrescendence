**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.60

> A chat interface producing a spreadsheet as an answer is an example of a hybrid AI approach, allowing users to instantly tweak numbers and see results, similar to how an LLM could generate UI code for direct manipulation.

## Claim (5)

> It is possible to achieve a new kind of "human in flow" UI for managing AI agents as models become faster and new information representations are designed for higher levels of abstraction, despite the current trend of managing many parallel agent chats.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260208-002-0003
**Lines**: 30-31

**Lines**: 39-43
**Context**: prediction / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.60

> AI agents will eventually be very fast, with some models like @cursor_ai's Composer already working at a speed that eliminates the need for task switching.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260208-002-0005
**Lines**: 45-49
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.80

> AI agents are adept at providing status updates, ranging from direct chat transcripts (representing their thoughts) to structured, zoomed-out views like progress bars, confidence scores, or diagrams.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260208-002-0006
**Lines**: 51-53
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The speed and status update capabilities of AI agents open up a design space that moves beyond designing for massive multitasking or wading through large chat transcripts.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260208-002-0007
**Lines**: 55-70

**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The "Minority Report UI" (designed by @john_under) is characterized by a direct and intimate connection between human and computer, functioning as a heads-up display with high throughput communication in both directions via gestures and voice, and a synchronous, flow-inducing experience.

## Praxis Hook (6)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260208-002-0001
**Lines**: 10-14
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Instead of managing AI agents by juggling chat threads, a "Minority Report"-style UI could enable high-bandwidth communication through data visualization for compressed information views, combined with natural language and direct manipulation for expressing intent.

**Lines**: 80-84
**Context**: method / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Visualizing agent progress on a kanban board, where tasks have live status and color codes, allows for a higher-level overview of work and the ability to interact with tasks more dynamically as models speed up.
