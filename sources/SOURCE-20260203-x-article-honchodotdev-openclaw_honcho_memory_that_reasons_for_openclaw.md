# OpenClaw + Honcho: Memory That Reasons for OpenClaw

![Hero image showing integration](Description: Landscape image on a light blue textured background featuring three elements arranged horizontally: on the left, a pixelated black and white circuit-board-style character with a friendly expression; in the center, a large black letter X; on the right, a red rounded blob-like character with antenna, two circular eyes, and small rectangular feet.)

Markdown files got you started.... but they won't get you anywhere close to AI native memory.

Take your OpenClaw assistant to the next level with SOTA memory. Honcho doesn't just remember—it builds a working model of who you are.

Already have context in your OpenClaw's memory files? The installer automatically migrates everything into Honcho. No extra steps.

And this integration doesn't require a "pro plan"—in fact, we give you $100 in credits at signup. Our pricing model and token efficiency mean these credits will last an individual user a looong time.

## Setup
```bash
echo "HONCHO_API_KEY=hc_..." >> ~/.openclaw/.env
```
```bash
openclaw plugins install @honcho-ai/openclaw
```

Restart the gateway, and you've got Honcho memory!

## How It Works

**Context on demand** — Before your assistant responds, Honcho injects relevant context into the prompt: your preferences, patterns, and conversation history. No more repeating yourself.

**Continual learning** — Messages flow to Honcho automatically. Our reasoning models analyze patterns and derive conclusions about you—not just store facts. Your assistant gets smarter over time without explicit memory commands.

**Memory tools** — AI tools let the agent query memory directly: search past conversations, look up your profile, pull session history, or ask complex questions about your preferences.

Traditional memory retrieves what was explicitly said (when it works). Honcho's reasoning extracts what matters—implicit connections, patterns across interactions, predictions based on behavior. No flimsy files. No local infrastructure. No manual memory management. Just continuous context that actually works.
