## Description (no transcript available)

On the December episode of ITK, ARK CEO/CIO Cathie Wood explains why ARK believes we’re on the verge of a major liquidity turn from both fiscal and monetary policy – and why that could lower inflation over the next few years. She walks through the data on tax cuts, money growth, yields, and productivity, and explains why the market’s “wall of worry” may be setting up one of the strongest bull markets yet.

00:33:00 Labor market, grads & AI entrepreneurship
