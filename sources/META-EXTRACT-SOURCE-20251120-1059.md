## Claim (4)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251120-1059-0002
**Lines**: 29-29
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Brandon Carter's argument suggests that the timing of intelligent life's evolution is linked to planetary habitability, implying that intelligent life might be rare.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251120-1059-0004

**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.50

> A 2021 Bayesian mathematical model quantifies the rarity of intelligent life, suggesting that its emergence on Earth's timeframe is an improbable event.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251120-1059-0005
**Lines**: 33-33
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.60

> An alternative perspective posits that evolution is tied to planetary conditions becoming permissive over time, rather than solely being a matter of chance.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251120-1059-0007
**Lines**: 35-35
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Intelligent life is likely very rare, and humanity may be unique, implying that detecting signals from other civilizations could indicate a great filter ahead.

## Concept (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251120-1059-0001
**Lines**: 19-19
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.00, consensus_pressure=1.00, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.00, actionability=0.00, epistemic_stability=1.00

> The Fermi paradox describes the contradiction between the high probability of extraterrestrial intelligent life existing and the lack of observational evidence for it.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251120-1059-0003
**Lines**: 30-30
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Evolutionary bottlenecks, also known as 'hard steps' or 'great filters,' are critical challenges in life's development that significantly reduce the probability of intelligent life emerging.

## Prediction (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251120-1059-0006
**Lines**: 34-34
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.40

> The implications of the 'great filter' concept suggest that if the filter is behind humanity, intelligent life is rare and humanity is safe; if it is ahead, humanity faces existential risks.
