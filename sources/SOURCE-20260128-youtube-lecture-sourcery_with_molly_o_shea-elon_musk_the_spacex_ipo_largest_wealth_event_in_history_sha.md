# Elon Musk & The SpaceX IPO: Largest Wealth Event in History? | Shaun Maguire, Sequoia

## Description (no transcript available)

Elon Musk has built more category-defining companies than any founder alive — and Sequoia Capital and Partner Shaun Maguire have backed five of them: SpaceX, xAI, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and X.

In this episode of Sourcery, Shaun breaks down how Elon builds trillion-dollar companies, why SpaceX may be the greatest company, largest IPO and wealth creation event of all time, and why he believes Elon is still massively underrated despite his global impact.

We dive into SpaceX’s IPO, Starlink’s explosive growth, data centers in space, direct-to-cell from orbit, xAI, and the unique way Elon builds long-term potential energy before unleashing scale.

Shaun also explains why SpaceX could become the biggest wealth creation event in history, how liquidity will reshape the tech ecosystem, and why Elon’s approach to power, infrastructure, and speed gives him an unmatched edge.

This is a deep look inside Elon’s operating system — from one of the most technically fluent investors in Silicon Valley.
