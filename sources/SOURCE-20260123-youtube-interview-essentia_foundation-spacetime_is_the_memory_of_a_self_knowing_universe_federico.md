## Description (no transcript available)

Our follow-up with CPU inventor Federico Faggin on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FUFewGHLLg&t=1s sponsored by Consensus AI: the AI powered science search engine with access to 220+ million studies.

In this conversation with Hans Busstra, the legendary CPU inventor explains his quantum theory of consciousness in more detail and outlines some of his novel ideas, to be presented in his upcoming new book. He discusses, for instance, how we should regard our material universe: “spacetime and matter are the permanent memory of the experience of the self knowing of One.” 

For a scientific elaboration of Federico's theory, see: "Hard Problem and Free Will: an information-theoretical approach,"  Giacomo Mauro D’Ariano and Federico Faggin: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06580
