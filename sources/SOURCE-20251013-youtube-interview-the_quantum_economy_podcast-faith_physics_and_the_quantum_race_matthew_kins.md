# Faith, Physics, and the Quantum Race: Matthew Kinsella on Commercializing Quantum

## Executive Summary

Matthew Kinsella, CEO of Infleqtion (quantum technology company going public), traces the path from VC investor to operational leader in quantum. The conversation provides a masterclass on quantum technology's commercial readiness—distinguishing it from hype—while exploring profound intersections of quantum mechanics with philosophy and faith. Kinsella argues quantum occupies the conceptual space religion traditionally held: the boundary between the known and unknown.

## Key Insights

### From "If" to "When": The Quantum Narrative Shift
The industry has passed an inflection point. Capital inflows, error correction advances, real demonstrations of quantum advantage, and geopolitical urgency have transformed the psychology from speculative to inevitable. Key factors: (1) billions in capital enabling talent acquisition and hardware development, (2) error correction techniques producing logical qubits, (3) real applications in drug discovery and logistics, (4) national security imperatives creating a race.

### Platform Diversification as Risk Management
Infleqtion's strategy: neutral atom technology platform across multiple revenue streams—quantum sensors, quantum networks, Rydberg antennas, and computing. This diversification de-risks the business against uncertain quantum computing timelines. Room-temperature operation (unlike superconducting) enables cost-effective deployment.

### Quantum Sensors: Commercial Now
GPS-denied navigation via quantum accelerometers is deployable today for submarines, contested airspace, autonomous vehicles. Rydberg antennas replace dozens of traditional RF antennas with a single device across huge frequency ranges. These are real revenue generators, not speculative.

### GPUs vs. Quantum: Nature's Substrate
Binary logic (zeros and ones) is a heuristic for simulating reality. Quantum computers *are* reality at the quantum level. Problems governed by quantum mechanics—molecular modeling, materials science, drug discovery—have natural affinity for quantum architectures. "We can force-fit that heuristic into quantum mechanics to a certain extent, but it will be much more efficient to do it with an underlying quantum architecture because that is how the world actually works."

### Quantum and the Religious Boundary
Kinsella, a practicing Catholic, reflects: religion has historically occupied the space between human understanding and mystery. As we explained thunder, that space shrank. Quantum still occupies that liminal zone—"it doesn't really make intuitive sense to us." Perhaps this is where "the higher power" resides. A genuinely exploratory stance from a technical CEO.

## Quotable Passages

> "There are still classes of problems that [GPUs] just aren't well-suited to solve. The most powerful GPU cluster at the end of the day is boiling all problems down to zeros and ones... That is not actually how nature works. Nature behaves by the laws of quantum mechanics." — Matthew Kinsella

> "In 2017 we came across the founders of Infleqtion, and what they were doing resonated with me because... they had a technology platform that could be applied to a bunch of different markets." — Matthew Kinsella on platform strategy

> "The narrative shifted from 'if' to 'when.' And once that shift happens, valuations change, timelines change, investor psychology changes. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy in some ways." — Matthew Kinsella

> "Quantum still very much occupies that space. It doesn't really make intuitive sense to us... there is a chance that maybe that is the layer where you can start to think of the higher power residing in some way." — Matthew Kinsella on faith and physics

## Transcript

no matter how powerful those GPUs get
and if we have some breakthrough in
energy and we're able to break or bend
that curve that what seems unsustainable
for the power demands to power these GPU
clusters we're able to flatten that
curve and we're able to figure out how
to do more interesting things with GPUs
there are still classes of problems that
they just aren't well suited to solve
and I think about those in the following
way the most powerful GPU cluster at the
end of the day is boiling all problems
down to zero zeros and ones, right? And
it's unbelievable what you can do with
that binary logic when done billions of
times. And they're going to keep finding
out great new use cases to point that
zero and one logic at. But that is not
actually how nature works, right? Nature
behaves by the laws of quantum
mechanics. And so the problems that are
under that bucket whether that is and
these are the common ones always talked
about you know molecular modeling so
therefore material science or drug
discovery and then you know optimization
type problems or or or other things of
that nature. I do think quantum
computers are going to get quantum
advantage on those types of problems
relatively quickly because the
underlying architecture is just suited
to solve those problems as opposed to
trying to force fit that zero and one
logic into these types of problems that
it's just a heruristic. Right? The world
doesn't actually work in zeros and ones.
It works based on quantum mechanics. And
so we can force fit that heristic into
quantum mechanics to a certain extent,
but it will be much more efficient to do
it underlying quantum architecture
because that is how the world actually
works. Welcome to another episode of the
quantum economy podcast.
Today I'm joined by Matthew Kinsella,
the CEO of Inflection.
Matt has a fascinating background from
venture capital and deep tech
investments and he was the seed investor
in inflection back in 2018 before
joining the company as their CEO in 2024
taking the company from a spinout to a
global player shaping the future of
quantum technologies in the field of
defense logistics finance and beyond.
Now at the helm of inflection, he's
going public with the company and he's
building the infrastructure of a quantum
future far beyond computing alone. He
has big hopes for humanity and his
values in place. Joining me from
Boulder, Colorado, the US capital of
quantum, here is the Quantum Economy
podcast with Matt Kinsella. So Matt,
first of all, thank you for coming on.
Um, is it the way to go with quantum now
to take a businessminded person, put him
on the top of the CEO, go public and to
commercialize? Are we are we there now?
>> Well, thank you for having me, Anders.
And and uh I I I guess so, right?
Because that has been my that has been
my trajectory to get into the company. I
came from the investment world, was the
first investor in inflection back in
early 2018, have been on the board ever
since, helping to build the company, and
then stepped in full-time to to uh work
at the business full-time back in the
beginning of last year and uh and made
the decision earlier this year that this
was the right path for us to go for a
lot of different reasons.
>> But I mean, you you have that that that
background as a deep tech investor. Um
and it's it's not very typical to then
take on an operational role in
particular if you look at you know the
interest of a broader deep tech uh
portfolio. Um what what what made you
like go into um to that role now and to
to see that inflection is the right um
horse to bet on so to speak?
>> You are very right that this is not that
normal. Um and and actually if I flush
out the whole situation for you, you'll
see um that you know there were many
versions of the world where this would
not have been the path of least
resistance. So if we go back to 2017,
well even go back further. I was at my
firm Maverick for 18 years. So I started
there right out of college. Maverick is
a a both a public equity investment fund
and then also a venture capital fund. I
started my career on the public equity
side of the business. So investing in
the stock market, focus on technology
and then in 2014 we decided as a firm to
launch an earlystage venture fund. And
this context is important just to to
answer your question actually. And so
Lee Anley, the founder of the fund,
asked me to move out to San Francisco
from New York to get that early stage
venture fund off the ground alongside a
partner. And for the next 10 years or
so, I was one of those partners running
that early stage venture fund. In 2017,
I got super curious about quantum.
started going down the quantum rabbit
hole, which is, as you know, a a windy
deep rabbit hole, and got totally hooked
um and met a lot of the different
companies that were around at the time.
And the conclusion that I walked away
with was the riskreward setup from an
investment perspective was actually
probably the best to start something
from scratch. And the reason for that
was the companies I met were all
relatively nent. um they were all had
potentially good upside potential, but
that upside was relatively binary in
nature. It was do you get a quantum
computer or or not and it was unclear at
the time which modality would even be
successful, let alone which company. And
so there was a lot of risk in making an
early stage investment such that that it
almost felt like the same amount of risk
to to build something from scratch with
with much more upside. So then I met I
went from meeting companies to
professors and ultimately led me to a
gentleman named Dana Anderson who is the
founder of inflection and Dana has been
a professor at CU Boulder for 40 years
and and and Dana's really the first
mover and pioneer in this quantum
modality called neutral atoms
>> and I got totally enamored with neutral
atoms when I met Dana largely because
they're very flexible and so there
wasn't that binary nature that a lot of
the other companies that had met with
neutral atoms, you can actually do a lot
of different interesting things with
them. I'm kind of going on a tangent. I
promise I'll tie it back to to why did I
why did I come here,
>> right? And so with with that in initial
investment lens and the idea that wow we
can build a quantum company that isn't
this you know binary bet but actually
you can point this neutral item engine
at a number of different interesting end
markets build a commercial entity and
then explore whether neutral items might
be an interesting candidate for that
crown jewel of a gatebased fault
tolerant quantum computer that can do
things that classical computers can't
do. At the time, neutral atoms hadn't
really been explored for that. A little
bit in the research lab, our chief
scientist, Mark Saffman, chief scientist
for quantum, had done some work in his
um in his lab at the University of
Wisconsin, but neutrons were kind of the
new kids on the block from a computing
perspective. So, I seated Dana in early
2018, joined the board, and I've been
helping build the company from my seat
on the board ever since, and then got
the really unique opportunity at the
beginning of last year to join
full-time. and and and so
I had all that history with the company.
I loved the company and as a VC and if
there any VCs are listening, they'll
they'll resonate with this. You always
have a one or two companies inside your
portfolio that you just gravitate to and
you spend way more time with than other
companies. And inflection was always
that company for me and and actually
sometimes my partners would would accuse
me of quote going native um because I
was so in love with the company, right?
And uh and so I um I when this
opportunity came along, I I I'd had
opportunities to go join our companies
before at Maverick and never really took
them seriously. On top of that, my my
wife um was a native is a native San
Franciscan. We had a two-month-old and a
four-year-old at the time. My wife's
parents had moved to Marin County. We
were going to move to Marin County. I'd
been at Maverick for 18 years. It was a
wonderful job. So there was a lot of
reasons why this was not the path of
least resistance to take this role. So,
why did I take it? I took it because
it's the most exciting company I've ever
seen. I mean, it's it's it has it's the
only company I've been a part of that
has the possibility to be the next
Nvidia. And obviously, we'd have to
execute the heck out of it to get there,
but it had that kernel. It has all the,
you know, the basic ingredients. And so,
the chance to be part of something
special like that early was really
exciting to me. And so what should have
been a hard decision um became a pretty
easy one once you know I got past the
first conversation with my wife which
was heck no. Uh then the next
conversation was maybe we'll think about
it. Then finally we we got there and so
that that's really why I took it because
I just I love this company. I think it's
going to be really important to get this
technology out in the world and I think
it's really important for um humanity to
to really bring quantum out to out to
the out to life. And so I felt like it
was something I had to do.
>> That's amazing. There's so many things,
so many layers to play with there. So
there's the the financial aspect,
there's the the path towards a brighter
path for humanity and then there's what
what what interests me I resonate with
that um relationship to a portfolio
company. So I have an investment in a 3D
DNA sequencing company. I'm looking into
the uh whole essence of um optimizing
enzymes and to play with uh you know a
quote unquote moving from chat dbt to
chat DNA uh moment. Very fascinating.
But I've also looked into many quantum
computing companies and um when you look
at an investor because I mean there are
physicists that have a very strong tie
to their approach how to build an error
corrected quantum computer or even a a
round temperature quantum computer. What
was it like the technical u hunch or or
the the I would say like the drive you
had towards inflection or was it a
people's business? what what what made
you, you know, put your your bet on
inflection?
>> So, when I met Dana, Dana was a
professor at CU, but he'd been running
inflection for for for several years at
that time. And it was, you know,
effectively an extension of his lab at
at CU Boulder.
>> Dana was part of several Nobel Prize
winning teams going back over the last
25 years or so. and and and all of those
teams worked on what effectively
culminated in neutral atom technology.
Dana is an applied physicist, not a
theoretical physicist. So, generally
speaking, the theoretical physicists are
the ones who win the Nobel prizes and
the the and the applied physicists build
the stuff, right? So, so Dana had
actually been building these core
foundational components. In fact, I can
show you one. I've got one on my desk.
Let me just this.
He'd been building these um really for
the last several two decades or so and
selling them to other academic
institutions so they could do neutral
atom experiments.
>> And so a what I what I really found
intriguing about Dana was he was a
quantum physicist but he actually had
like commercial drive like he he was in
it to try to build and and and grow this
technology as opposed to just doing it
for academia. So, so immediately I was
drawn to data because of that, you know,
underlying commercialization mindset
which isn't that prevalent in academia
broadly speaking. So, so from the
people's aspect of it, I really really
really kind of again I'll use that word
enamored. I was enamored with Dana for a
number of reasons. So, he was, you know,
the the horse or the person that I that
I wanted to back in this in this in this
race.
The other element of it was the neutral
atom modality. And so as I was going
down the early stages of my trip down
the rabbit hole, I I never even heard of
neutral atoms. It wasn't really in the
conversation. And that was largely
because back then and some in some ways
today when you say quantum people assume
the only kind of companies are computing
companies and neutral atoms hadn't
really been pointed at compute at that
point. It had been in academia but but
not commercially. And so when I learned
about it, I I I was fascinated by the
possibilities. And I'm not a physicist,
so I wasn't going to be able to tell
you, you know, the the the the actual
underlying elements as to why this
modality was better. But the flexibility
is what drew me to it. And and and the
idea that we can actually create a
multi-shot goal shot and goal approach
to building a business and then explore
whether this modality might be
interesting for computing. So it wasn't
necessarily like I looked at trapped
ions, I looked at superconducting, I
looked at phatonics, I looked at neutral
atoms and said neutral atoms is
definitively, you know, superior to
these other modalities. It was more that
there was nothing that telling was
telling me that it wasn't for computing
and I got to have these d-risked
investment opportunities to build these
other products with this same underlying
modality. So to me it was partially Dana
but partially the flexibility and
because of the flexibility of the
possibilities multiple ways to win that
I really liked about it and it didn't
have that binary nature. And if you fast
forward to today it's been really
rewarding to see that seed thesis play
out. We we've built several really
really robust commercial products in the
quantum sensing umbrella that we've been
monetizing along the way. And then the
big surprise has been neutral atoms have
gone from this darkhorse quantum
computing modality to really leading the
way on on most of the metrics that
matter and on on our on our journey
towards gatebased fall tolerant quantum
computers that can do things that
classical computers can't do.
>> Yeah. Because I see the the quantum
communication the quantum sensing path
of it and then you see the challenges on
compute. So, so I was very curious
about, you know, back then, uh, you
know, backing it as an investor. You see
a promising seed bet. I get that. But,
you know, taking the step in the midst
of what was back then when you, you
know, you you took the job, it was kind
of sort of reaching that um, investment
hype that we have seen over the past 12,
you know, to 16 months. and you've seen
big players with Microsoft and uh
leading the way with a lot of uh I would
say like more of a hype communication
marketing theme right so it was very
interesting to just get your um
background why you decided to go with
Dana and to go with inflection so thank
you for that and and
>> yeah absolutely
>> and going to Boulder Colorado being on
on in the Bay Area it's like I um I I
just took my dad um um to to the a
couple of months ago and I uh I spent a
year in Nebraska and my dad and myself
we took a car and drove all the way up
to to Colorado through Nebraska the Dumb
and Dummer route because I
>> thought the Rockies would be a little
bit rockier than this, right?
>> No, because I wanted to go up to Boulder
and figure out what that place is all
about because of that quantum clearly.
So, so it's interesting. So, um, so, so
thank you so much for for sharing.
>> Well, Andrew, I'll tell you one thing.
My my I grew up in Illinois and a lot of
my family was from, um, lived in, in
western Nebraska, and that journey
across Nebraska is a brutal one. It it
it's like corn fields forever, right?
Yeah.
>> But I we were when the corn was not
there, so it was like earlier 2025,
Aprilish. So, it's just it's basically
flat. But I wanted to go back where I
stayed. So, I went there when I was 17.
uh did a year of exchange program and I
never figured out why I went there to
play sixman football and live with a
family in a small village. Uh but like
spirit and I'm very interested in you
know societies and people and all that
stuff. So we had a very very um I would
say um
very rich um flares of US from New York
to Nashville to Nebraska and Boulder,
Colorado and Washington just traveling.
>> Very very different uh different views
of what the US is like in those various
parts. Good good people in Nebraska.
Good cornfeded Midwesterners as we like
to call them.
>> Straight straight drives. You could just
you know lean back and kind of sort of
feel like you slept for a couple of
minutes. So
>> yeah. Yeah.
>> No, but um interesting. I mean I just
also take on the market um a lot of um
big uh recent announcement on uh I would
say investments. If you also look at the
publicly traded quantum companies, uh
there's never been a larger gap between
the ratio of uh sales and valuation. How
do you look at the market right now? Is
it hyped? Do you think that's
substantial? Are we seeing a new kind of
a logic to investments because of the
impact? What is your take on on on the
market?
>> And just to make sure we're clear, we're
talking about the market for the capital
raising or is it market for selling
quantum products?
>> No, I would I would say the ratio
between the the current revenue. So a
lot of that I mean a lot of the revenue
probably that you also have are are
research project and and things that are
quantum to do smaller things before you
get into that actual you know scale
implication of of the revenue part. So
I'm looking at the valuation ratio
towards uh to the revenue. Yeah.
>> Yeah. Okay. Understood. I think there's
there's let me touch on just one aspect
of the market as it relates to the
actual you know selling of the products
and the commercializ is of the business.
And I can then I can talk about you know
the the spread or the the multiple on
revenue towards the to to the market
caps of some of the players. I I I do
agree that really all quantum computing
sales are still in that research bucket,
right? It's it's some government
somewhere has allocated dollars to buy a
quantum computer and and then and then
we or another quantum computing company
fulfills that sale and gets the money
and then builds a quantum computer. But
the great thing about that is is it
helps you get better at building quantum
computers and and getting them towards
that magical number where they'll start
to do things that classical computers
can't do. And it's great for the
government entity, whether that's an
academic institution or a national lab
or in some cases like the NQCC in the
UK. They get to learn how to use quantum
computers, train the workforce, and then
importantly those that that real
estate's upgradeable, right? You can you
can then make those computers
commercially useful over time. It's
different on the sensing market. Like
there there are quantum sensing products
that we sell. We sold 11 million of
clocks at the DoD that are actually
commercially advantageous. And and I
think you're starting to see that
markets are starting to demand the level
of performance that those quantum
sensors can provide. And so I do think
you're going to see an increasingly
robust commercial market. It might still
be in that national security bucket or
so for some of these quantum sensing
products. And I do think we'll see that
that grow. So I just want to make that
distinction that most of the quantum
computing revenue is still very much in
the research phase. Some of the quantum
sensing is but increasingly quantum
sensors are being sold in a in a
commercialized way because they can do
things for instance keep time orders of
magnitude more precisely than than
classical standards. So, so there's the
there's my comments on kind of the the
the the game on the field for the uh for
the actual commercial business uh parts
of the parts of the parts of the market
as it relates to the valuations. I do
think what you're seeing and and and I
do want to also say I was a public
market investor for many years trying to
explain why stocks are doing what
they're doing is effectively impossible.
So, I want to just make sure everything
I say is is speculative and you just
don't know because sometimes the market
just does what it does, right? Um, and
and the best advice I ever learned from
being a a public equity investor was
don't ever give stock tips to your
friends. Uh, because there's a
reasonable chance you're going to be
wrong. And and honestly, if in the
public equity world, if you're batting
above 500, meaning you're just getting
things right more than you're getting
them wrong a little bit, you're actually
ahead of the pack. So, all of those
disclaimers said, here's my thesis on
what's happening in the public markets.
I think um
quantum computing has gone from
something that's kind of been a rolling
five years away to seemingly in a more
def definitive time fiveyear time
period. And and and I think the reason
why is logical cubits and and the before
the world got logical cubits, it was
unclear as to whether quantum computers
were ever going to reach that point
where they would actually be more
powerful in certain circumstances than
classical computers. Once we actually
showed that logical cubits were
possible, it now is just a matter of
time. So now it's gone from if to when
and I think that has been an underlying
shift. Whether like the average person
buying quantum stocks knows about that
shift, I don't know. But I think it's
kind of gotten the ball rolling and so
now it's now it's turned into okay this
is happening. Um you we we have logical
cubits we just need more of them. And I
think most people and I fall in this
camp agree that a 100 logical cubits is
where you start to see minimum viable
commercial advantageous um use cases for
class quantum computers versus
classical. And and now we're we're are
marching towards that that 100 logical
cubit threshold. We just announced that
we had 12 logical cubits last week and
and we're moving towards on a a pretty
defined engineering roadmap to get to
that 100 logical cubit level. So I think
there's a a shift from it's going from
if to when and now if it's not if and
it's when, how big is that opportunity
going to be and and investors don't want
to miss out the opportunity to be the
next AI wave or something like that,
right? And so I think you're starting to
see some of those possibilities
discounted into the stock prices before
they normally would be, especially
relative to where the, you know, the the
revenues are at these points in times.
And so, and that's not unusual for these
types of cutting edge technologies
because often the growth can be
explosive in the underlying um revenue
and profitability metrics, which you see
with something like OpenAI. every time
it looks crazy expensive and then all a
sudden you fast forward a year and their
revenue have gone up by 100x or whatever
it is. And so I think people are are
starting to extrapolate that that might
be possible and I'm not saying it's
what's going to happen but it might be
possible in quantum and therefore they
want to make sure they have a play. And
so I think there's there's all those
elements happening. I think maybe
there's some AI fatigue in the market
and they're looking for what's the next
thing and and that possibly could be
quantum. And so a lot of different
things are are playing out, but you are
right that that the valuations you're
seeing in quantum are significantly
higher than they've ever been
historically.
>> So what do you think? I mean we
obviously could also have an argument
that we haven't reached any limitation
on CPUs and GPUs on scaling and energy
efficiency uh transistors that are more
efficient. Um, do you do you see that
the argument the race for actual uh
quantum computing is so strong or or is
there still a big risk that we might
actually have a new transistor and some
efficiency with the current GPUs of
Nvidia and we would just have uh you
know infinite access to energy through
some new breakthroughs in material
design without actually a quantum
computer. Do you do you see that or do
you think that there is now a very very
clear evidence that we will eventually
have uh significant advantages also not
in the very outlier uh complex uh
calculations but also in some highly
commercialized products within quantum.
>> It's a good question. I think everyone's
been surprised to our upside as to what
we've been able to push GPUs, what what
they can do, right? What we've been able
to figure out how to do with them. And
and my guess is we'll keep figuring out
how to do amazing things with GPUs. My
sense though is that
no matter how powerful those GPUs get
and if we have some breakthrough in
energy and we're able to break or bend
that curve that what seems unsustainable
for the the power demands to to power
these these these GPU clusters we're
able to flatten that curve and we're
able to figure out how to do more
interesting things with GPUs. There are
still classes of problems that they just
aren't well suited to solve. And and I
think about those in in the following
way. Even that even I forget what XAI's
cluster down in Nashville is called,
right? Maybe Optimus or what whatever
that's called, right? The most powerful
GPU cluster at the end of the day is
boiling all problems down to zeros and
ones, right? And it's unbelievable what
you can do with that binary logic when
done billions of times. and and and so
they're going to keep finding out great
new use cases to point that zero and one
logic at but but that is not actually
how nature works, right? Nature behaves
by the laws of quantum mechanics. And so
the problems that are under that bucket
whether that is and these are the common
ones always talked about you know
molecular modeling so therefore material
science or drug discovery and then you
know kind of derivative
optimization type problems or or or
other things of that nature. I do think
quantum computers are going to get
quantum advantage on those types of
problems relatively quickly because the
underlying architecture is just suited
to solve those problems as opposed to
trying to force fit that zero and one
logic into these types of problems that
it's just a heruristic right the world
doesn't actually work in zeros and ones
it works based on quantum mechanics and
so we can forcefitit that heristic into
quantum mechanics to a certain extent
but it will be much more um efficient to
do it via quantum
underlying quantum architecture because
that is how the world actually works.
>> Right.
>> I don't know if I said that in the most
elegant way, but but I think you get the
point.
>> Yeah. And and I I agree with you. I
mean, this is uh Richard Fman speaking
out, right? If we
>> Exactly. Yeah. Just just look at look at
what Richard Fineman said. He's he's
gonna say it way better than I did.
Yeah.
>> Just the way of of setting up. But uh
and but but I wanted to to get like your
thoughts on all these parts of of of I
mean obviously I I I see you have a a
huge uh um you know depth in your
knowledge and understanding of of
quantum technologies. But I I really
wanted to have that quantum economical
implication and and and to talk to you
about that and and we have that you know
often quoted as the quantum or framed as
a quantum race. Um what's your take
because you also have that value driven
approach to improve the state of
humanity. Is the race today a race
between nations or um you know do we
have like a a a collaborative global
challenge in the making to to serve that
or you know your vision of a better
humanity.
>> Yeah, it is a race and there's no doubt
about it and it's very motivating to me.
Um
because I think it's really important
that that that humanity finishes this
race. I wish it was that simple though.
I I do think unfortunately there are
going to be winners and and and not
winners in this race. And I feel very
strongly that the US and our allies
whether it's Germany or the UK or
Australia
win that race. And I think there are
huge national security implications and
huge implications for our way of life.
And um and I I wish it could all just be
humanity benefiting as a whole from
this, but I just don't unfortunately
don't think that's actually the case.
And so I do think it is a race against
between nation states. Um and and and
kind of, you know, multiple nation
states working together on one side and
multiple nation states kind of working
together on another. And and the
national security implications
are wide ranging. Um just the computing
aspect of it obviously is going to have
huge implications for the ability to
perform calculations that probably will
have hu huge implications on the
battlefield. Obviously decryption is one
thing that everybody is is very
concerned about. But the whole sensing
application is is huge as well. again
that the precision that you can bring
with quantum timekeeping or quantum
communications or quantum sensing
is orders of magnitude better than
classical standards. And let's just use
GPS as an example.
>> Yeah,
>> GPS is a position, navigation, timing
system. The timing is the most important
thing that comes down from GPS. And so
much of our critical infrastructure is
based upon the synchronization that they
get to the GPS network. It's way more of
an issue in your neck of the woods. Uh
but GPS is or GNSS in general is
becoming increasingly denied, spoofed,
and you're not able to rely on it. And
if we just think about the implications
on the battlefield,
>> let's just say, God forbid, something
happened and we turned into a hot war
over the Taiwanese straight, the first
thing to go is going to be GPS, right?
You're going to have to operate in a GPS
denied environment. And the side that
can do that will have an enormous
advantage. And and I like to think that
the knowledge that the other side has
that capability might be a deterrent.
And so to me, it's like I think we need
to get quantum sensors, quantum
timekeeping devices in the hands of our
troops as soon as possible
because in the in the horrible scenario
where something actually happens, it
will give them a huge advantage, but
hopefully more importantly, it'll be a
deterrent because the other side will
know that they're going to be up against
a force that would just be very
difficult to deal with. So I do think
it's a huge race and uh and and and be
objectively a good thing for all all of
humanity to bring quantum technologies
out in the world and I wish that was it
was as easy as that but I I think there
is that that nation state race element
of it for sure.
>> Yeah. No, I think that's a very
important point that you have and um and
I wanna u we want to public this episode
um you know in the lights of your your
um your public listing and your spack
and I want to get to that in a bit but
um I I just want to mention that as we
speak this is uh an ongoing in Denmark
you know it's uh the drone attack in
Denmark um flying over um military um
resorts flying over the airports Uh
there are ships that are discovered on
the borderline between international
waters and Danish waters. Um they are
Russian battleships that have blocked
the GPS and are not traceable and there
have drones flying over Denmark. Uh it
could be a relationship between those
ships lying 200 kilometers from the the
border of Denmark and sending up these
drones. um that is not proven as we
speak, but that is an exact example of
of how this um warfare already today uh
is a significant threat to national
security um unless you have the
technology. So um you know where we're
looking days of intraceable um attacks
to drones. I mean they're just flying
over and recording and um you know
shedding light. there is no as we speak
no attack but it just proves your point
right how critical uh this is and u you
know the whole aspect of uh QDS and
postquantum cryptography and the whole
aspect of sensing I think it's just as
you say I I agree and it's it's a race
um but on that point um how do you then
see um the um the the the whole essence
of innovation and ideas and creation as
You mentioned you've done a lot of seed
investing. You come also from that.
>> Um are we seeing then a switch with
quantum that the whole startup community
will will not be um uh you know will not
be a thing because any idea will just be
integrated because you just need the
huge investments you need the teams you
need to scale so fast that there is no
room for a classical startup to grow. So
it's all about scaling and this this
race becomes so powerful so big. So it's
just about you know the huge investments
uh a winner takes all type of scenario.
Um do you see a shift then in how we
operate uh also on the business side and
technology side?
>> In some ways that question is about the
underlying economic model that the
countries are pursuing. I think and and
if we just look at maybe China
exemplifying the top down approach and
and we'll just use the US but plenty of
other examples is maybe the bottoms up
approach. Um,
I think we've seen that
even if it gets a slower start, the
bottoms up approach wins. Um, and and
the unleashing of ingenuity and and
innovation and competitive, you know,
competitive destruction and and
ultimately the cream rising to the top
is is the superior economic model to
break into technologies like this. Um
and and so I will bet on the let's call
it western economic model and innovation
model any day of the week. That said,
this is expensive technology and it is
technology that as we pointed out
especially in the compute side of things
doesn't have
commercial advantage today. So
therefore, it's very hard to do kind of
that lean product uh lean startup, you
know, quick product market fit iteration
um model that you use to to bring other
less deep tech type of uh startups out
into the world. So, I do think that the
that there there does need to be certain
levels of stimulation from the top um to
help you know speed that process along
until you can actually get to the point
where someone like let's just use what's
a good example um trying to think of a
good company based in Frankfurt uh
Deutsche Bank right Deutsche Bank can
say I'm going to take 20 million 30
million $50 million off my balance sheet
buy quantum computer and know I'm going
to earn a return off of it. Now, there's
an actual market for for that and then
you can use those gross profit dollars
that you earn to further, you know, fuel
the innovation engine. But we aren't
there yet for computing. Honestly, part
of the reason why I built the company
the way we did was because we needed to
identify those earlier stage markets
where we could have commercial advantage
and actually build a real business. And
that's why I was uncomfortable with the
binary nature of the computing or
nothing because that it was going to be
a while before you had commercial
advantage on the computing side of
things. So I do think you do need a
certain level of stimulation from the
top to help fuel and and and you know
keep that innovation engine going uh on
the western model and so I think we are
doing an okay job of that but could do
much more and whether it's in the form
of grand challenges or the form of just
buying more systems and so the c the
companies can actually earn gross profit
dollars to continue to you know invest
in the R&D and ultimately bring the the
winning technology out but I think the
competitive dynamics are are incredibly
important. important to have companies
competing because that's what pushes you
further faster and picking winners from
the top is very dangerous. Um, and I
think that that is why a lot of times
that top down you know like command and
control model just doesn't work as well.
>> So that's about it.
>> You could push back and say if you look
at the recent development with Oracle,
you could look at you know Elon and his
endeavors and if you look at the
satellite communication it's it's a
monopoly in space. there is no one's
going to catch up in the next 10 20
years. Uh building you know uh reusable
rockets will take some time even for the
Chinese. Uh you could look at Nvidia. I
mean Nvidia is close to I think it's 2x
of the ducks the German ducks index.
Yeah.
>> So you take your your your Deutsche Bank
example. It's huge right? It's huge. But
if if Deutsche Bank makes a lot of money
and Vidia could pay it out of their
pockets like it was a a small takeover,
it's it's just the the dimension the
magnitude of the valuation is just
getting so out of you know what what we
can grasp. And that and that's what I
what I think that even though we seem to
have that startup innovation western you
call it right democratic structures it
is in a sense becoming so powerful that
a handful of people uh could literally
buy anything they want uh in that realm
of of scaling. So uh um it's very
interesting to look at our scientific
innovative model and you see the
magnitude of um of of of these companies
and say you know why would they innovate
they could just buy anything right so
it's it's very interesting time I think
in that sense it is Anders and I think
you know it is um
there is absolutely an element of that
and and I think we need to be very
careful because if it's too consolidated
then that does break the whole system. I
still just will always make the bet on
this system because if you look at those
companies that occupy those spaces now,
many of them didn't exist 20 years ago,
right? And Nvidia was kind of a a blip
on the radar screen until 5 years ago.
And so I do think that the the winds can
shift very quickly and and uh it's not
like this has been, you know, the same
company for a hundred years, you know,
being in control of everything. And so I
still think that they need to stay on
their toes because companies can come
out of nowhere and and completely usurp
their position. And I think that's what
actually keeps pushing the progress
forward. But if we get to the point
where it stagnates and you're right,
like companies can just buy anything
that's starting to show promise, that's
a very dangerous risk for our innovation
system. For sure.
>> Yeah. Now I had an interesting
conversation with uh you probably know
from Strange Works and his vision to um
you know enable a billion minds to do
scientific breakthrough. So we were
talking a little bit about like how
noble lecturers used to come out of
academia but now due to the fact that
they get much more money to go into the
corporate labs they can do the same
thing and work with infinite uh
resources and not the bureaucratic
processes then the noble lecturers will
come out of corporates and he envisions
a world where someone from you know a
rural town in Rus in Norway where I'm uh
where I came from or from some you know
small place in Africa or Asia that they
can just you know with that
computational power and the software uh
be able to have those breakthroughs and
to build those values. So it's a very
interesting time because it's very hard
to predict how these models will uh will
develop. So so maybe you can you know
elaborate a little bit about your
decision then to to do us back and to to
go public and to just now most likely
with the intention to fuel the company
with enough resources to grow faster.
>> Yeah.
Well, we were very well capitalized
after we raised our series C at the
beginning of this year. And
>> I saw that that I was so curious about
that. Yeah.
>> Yes. So, we we already were in good
shape. You know, we had $100 million
plus in the balance sheet. We have a a
reasonably low burn rate relative,
especially to the publicly traded
companies, but call it, you know, $30
million a year. So, we had a good
three-year window to operate. And it was
there were there were in many ways that
seemed quite nice where let's not worry
about capital raising and let's just
let's just execute because we've got
time to do it. What I saw happening
though was the publicly traded companies
start to take advantage of their
position and raise very large amounts of
capital 500 million billion dollars. And
then you see some of the private
companies raising very large amounts of
capital as well. And we did fine in our
in our private raise and we achieved
what we wanted to. But it was clear that
the you know the game was was ch was was
starting to change and might change much
much more. So I kind of made a
commitment to myself at the beginning of
this year that I needed to at least
explore some ways to change the game for
inflection. And I looked at a number of
different routes to do that. Just you
know fast following raising another
private round of capital was one of
those options. We looked at going public
via traditional IPO. The the short
answer was though those would all take
quite a bit of time probably and I felt
like the time was now. And so I went
into this process with four principles.
Number one,
first principle across any of those was
could we find a world-class partner to
work with because you just don't want to
sacrifice on that principle. Number two,
could we find a quantum of capital that
would effectively take the existential
risk of running out of capital off the
table? And actually put a pause button
on that one for a second because there
is an interesting uh uh point to make on
that. And number three, could we have a
very high probability that we would get
that capital on the balance sheet? And
then number four, could we do it at a
cost of capital that was both fair to
our existing investors, but also could
make it a case where new investors had a
great opportunity to to earn a good
return as well. And and those were my
four principles. And ultimately meeting
the Church Hill, the team at the Church
Hill Group, I was able to easily
accomplish all four of those principles.
And so it became very obvious to me that
that was the right path to go. Um let's
circle back on that second point I made
the existential risk. The other thing in
the back of my mind was you know that
that clearly people were raising a lot
of capital but as I thought just about
inflection and I imagined five years
down the line and I imagined some
scenarios that were
scenarios where inflection just didn't
work. We failed. Um, not a lot of those
scenarios involved not getting the tech
right, which sounds kind of crazy
because this is quantum, which so you'd
think that would have been at the top of
the list. The almost all the scenarios
were we ran out of capital, right? And
and and and let's say two years down the
line when it was time to go raise our
series D, the markets weren't
accommodative and we couldn't get it
done and we had to close up shop. And so
I thought if I could take that
existential risk off the table, if we
could raise an amount of capital that
for almost all foreseeable scenarios
would keep us capitalized, that was very
attractive to me. And so that was really
the reason why we went down this path.
The added benefit of it and you've seen
the publicly traded coin companies do
this, especially INQ, is now you have a
public currency to make acquisitions. I
am wary of acquisitions because a lot of
them don't work. But tech tuck-in
acquisitions can be very powerful if
they accelerate your direct roadmap. And
I do think there may be some private
quantum companies that maybe are at risk
of falling to that existential threat I
just made and and there might be a home
for them at inflection. And that's a lot
easier to do if you have a public
currency um because it just is easier to
to to make those acquisitions. And so
that wasn't the primary driver, but I
have a hunch that over the next three
years, it's going to be a very important
thing to have and will give us
flexibility to possibly make some of
those types of acquisitions where it's a
it's a 1 plus 1 equals 10 situation.
It's great for the people that join the
business via that acquisition and it's
great for inflection because it
accelerates our road map.
>> Wow, that's uh that's really really
strong. I think there is so much to
learn from that and to take out of that
analytical path and and thinking about
those scenarios and and it's something
that I've written a lot about how to
anticipate the future uh and to create
the now out of future scenarios and uh
not many leaders are good at that. So
there is the path of exponential
progress of technology which everyone
says we think it'll be progress but they
don't really sit down and think about
what that means. And the other is what
do we think of humanity? Uh what do you
think human beings will do? What kind of
business models and structure can you
foresee? Uh so uh yeah so thank you so
much for for sharing that. I think
that's that's really powerful. Um so so
what are then the next um steps now in
in terms of uh inflection? What are the
road map the detailed road map for for
scaling and also what are the challenges
of scaling an organization? I think one
thing is obviously getting good
engineers and physicists. I mean, that's
a word for talent, isn't it?
>> Yeah, it it's uh we're not quite there
yet, you know, in the AI world where
you're seeing hundred million dollar pay
packages put in front of put in front of
>> that's the best that then you know
you've done something wrong. You're
missing out on something. When you go
desperate and you have too much cash on
a dead business model potentially, uh
then you have to do that. So I think
that's um that's screaming we we uh
messed up but yeah
>> totally totally yes. So what's next for
us? So um
I'll I'll answer it in two ways. We have
um we have to commercialize and grow the
quantum sensing business and and and
what what that means is we have quantum
clocks that are about you know call it
the size of a Xbox a little bit bigger
and those have incredible performance
capabilities and they you know we float
them on airplanes we've put them on
ships they've actually gone underwater
and and and and they have gone into data
centers and and show real commercial
advantage relative to classical
standards. We need to build the go to
market team that can get those out into
the world. And in addition, we need to
take that, call it, it's a 3U rack
mount, so a little bit bigger than an
Xbox, and shrink that down to a one-year
rack mount, which is the size of a pizza
box, call it, and ultimately down to
chip scale. And that's one of the the
magic, that's one of the things that are
magical about neutral atoms is it's
mostly all based on photonics. So you
can integrate all of that down to
phetonic level integrated circuits. So
that's the end state for most of our
technologies. So on the sensing side of
the business, we need to continue to
drive down the size, weight, power, and
cost of the underlying the underlying
components and therefore the systems
themselves and then get those out to
market and and actually fulfill the
demand that's out there with that GPS
denial being one of the really strong
tailwinds. Um, and then same for our
quantum RF antennas. They can do nearly
magical things. because we haven't
talked about them yet, but you know
there are huge commercial opportunities
both within the DoD and and the
intelligence community and also just the
broader um the broader uh the broader
market for that type of product. And
then finally, our our our inertial
sensors are I'd say more in the realm of
research still today. We have sent them
to space. They we sent them up to to the
International Space Station to be
gravimeters actually back in 2018 and
we're working to send more of those up
into space with NASA. And so really, I'd
say a lot of
not R&D in the sense you'd think of with
the computer, but R&D in the sense of
commercializing and getting these into
form factors that are more useful and
then driving the go to market on the
sensing side of the business.
>> On the computing side of the business,
sorry
the computing side of the business, it's
it's continuing to push that logical
cubit road map, right? We need to get
it. We're at 12 today. We need to get to
100. Right now, we have two test beds.
one effectively for quantity of cubits
and and one for quality of cubits and
and and we've got 1,600 physical cubits
on the quantity system and then we've
got very high quality 99.73% gate
fidelity um on the on the quantity
system and then we we or the quality
system. We put those two together and
that's how we create our logical cubits
and and so we we we now have 12 and
really a very a very believable
engineering road map to get us to 100
and then to a thousand. And so on the
computing side of it, it's drive to that
as quickly as possible and and so
continue to drive up the quantities,
continue to drive up the quality and
then bring those together for logical
cubits. And then also there's there's as
we talked about a reasonable market to
sell quantum computing systems. So we're
going to continue to do that. And so
it's all driving towards this needs to
ultimately be a you know very cash flow
positive entity that is servicing real
customer demand with products that
provide huge advantages relative to
classical standards. And that's what we
think about every day is how do we build
this business to be that? And it's not
going to be tomorrow that we're going to
be profitable. Nor would it be
necessarily the smart thing to do
because the profit pools in the future
are so massive you want to invest behind
them today. But ultimately, you know, a
company's only the the company's value
is just the the discounted future free
cash flows, right? So if there are never
any free cash flows, there are zero
there's zero value. And so we just need,
you know, obviously that's the long term
that's the long-term goal for the
business,
>> right? So, so what are um you know what
is your internal um timeline for the 100
and a thousand logical cubits?
>> 2028 for the 100 um and then and then
2030 for the thousand which is what the
current current road map is.
>> All right. And and and to the antennas I
was curious about that what what are
what are the use cases here? Um was just
trying to I was thinking as you were
speaking because you haven't talked a
lot about it. you said what what are
yeah the the business use cases that you
see there.
>> Yes. Well, maybe let me just define what
these Ridberg antennas are first. So,
>> at the core of everything you do with
neutral atom technology is you have some
sort of cell. It might be an ultra high
vacuum cell. It might be a vapor cell.
And then you have lasers and you are and
inside those cells are a bunch of atoms.
And then with the lasers, you're working
with those atoms to turn them into
products. And I don't need to tell this
audience what we mean when we say
quantum, but we're just talking about
the world of the very small, the atomic
and the subatomic, and then the very
strange uh quantum mechanics that take
place at that level, which we don't need
to talk about. But but but but when you
say quantum technologies, you're taking
advantage of those weird quantum
mechanics and then turning them into
products. So so we can turn those
rubidium atoms into clocks by
effectively exciting them with uh an
ultra high frequency laser. And then the
energy transition becomes a very stable
frequency reference that ticks very very
precisely.
Those same ribidium atoms if put into
what's called their rberg state which is
the most excited they can be before they
become an ion. Right? So you can think
of the electron way out in orbit. Those
atoms in their rberg state become very
sensitive to the entire electromagnetic
spectrum. And so therefore, you can turn
those atoms into antennas, which is
actually mind-boggling when you think
about it because it turns on its head we
know about RF technology from the last
120 years, right? Which is normally the
RF waves are received by some kind of
metallic aperture, which is an antenna
which resonates based upon that
frequency and then you can extract the
electric signal inside that wave that
way. In this case, you don't need that
antenna. The atoms are the antenna. And
when you're using classical RF
technology, your antenna needs to be
about the same size as the wavelength
that you're receiving, right? And and it
can only receive a very, you know, very
narrow slug of the electromagnetic
spectrum. So you have probably 10
antennas in your iPhone because you're
receiving GNSS, you're receiving
standard cellular signals, right? You're
receiving Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. Each of
those has its own antenna. you could
collapse all those down to one something
the size of a sugar cube because we can
dynamically tune it based upon the
lasers to each of those frequency bands.
So that's one of the magic parts of
this. It's in a form factor today where
it's never going to it's not going to be
in your phone for a while. It's it's a
the aperture itself is about the size of
a sugar cube, but it's hooked up to a
photonic system that today is the size
of a mini fridge. Here's the killer app
today though.
>> For the very low frequency
longwavelength signals that are used for
a lot of different military
communications channels, you need huge
antennas. Like I don't know, you might
have dragged an antenna to your roof one
time that's massive, right? Or at the
extreme, submarines dangle antennas that
are a kilometer long,
>> right?
>> Our rberg atoms can receive those
signals. So you can vastly vastly shrink
the size of these antenna systems. And
there are all kinds of interesting use
cases there. Think of the intelligence
community. If they need to put up a huge
antenna to receive something, they're a
target. Now, if you can do something the
size of a sugar cube, you're not. And
importantly, these emit no signals
themselves. So, completely undetectable.
And every time you normally would
receive a signal, you are putting out a
signal yourself and therefore become a
target. So, a lot of really interesting
intelligence community and and defense
community use cases, but ultimately you
could see these being on every cell
tower. You could see these, you know,
look, you look at a battleship, looks
like a porcupine because there's so many
different antennas. Those could all be
collapsed onto one. So, huge use cases
for this river technology.
>> Well, that is new to me. I haven't I
haven't seen a lot of those cases uh and
demonstration. That's very fascinating.
Uh thank you so much for for for that.
Uh that's um yeah, that's very
interesting. That's um but then you can
also think then uh and and again thank
you so much for for I mean this is been
really really interesting to me because
I was hoping to get that um economical
aspect of it and you've dug into the uh
bridge between the technology and and
the economy and that's very fascinating.
So it was all I was hoping for to to
pick your brain on Matt. So that's been
a real joy for me to to listen to you.
>> Oh it's been a wonderful conversation
Andrew. Thank you very much. I've really
enjoyed it. It went by went by really
fast actually. I can't believe it's
already been close to an hour.
>> Close an hour. No, that's But I want to
just like kind of sort of I I do this
because I've I've written about the
simulation hypothesis uh my recent book
with my quantum physicist colleague. We
call it sci-fi science philosophy with
the phi because we take push the borders
and and um one of the things that that
that I look into is that I think that
the externalization of an artificial
general intelligence some kind of
singularity put into a machine uh is not
a very you know um positive path
potentially for humanity. And what we
argue is that we take um the mench the
human being uh the essence of
consciousness the qualia what it feels
like what we do not yet understand and
and to be to romanticize of the concept
of the mench hopefully never will get.
So we start with that and we hack
chemistry, we hack biology, we build
biological substrins and we create what
we call artificial human intelligence
and um you know look at the antenna why
should it w you know wander into the
phone and not in here right um so so
what do you think
um are there limits then to to to you
know quantum technologies and quantum AI
and technology uh is there in your
vision for a positive future for
humanity. Are there things that we
cannot explain that are outside of
quantum physics that are related to some
other dimension uh what it means to be a
human being or do you see us all
chemical scum plus some math and some
quantum physics?
>> Wow, I love this question and I I um so
I'll I'll I'll say a few things before I
answer just so you know where I'm coming
from. So I'm I grew up a Catholic. Um,
so I'm I'm Christian and and so believe
in believe in a a higher power of some
sort. I've also spent a lot of time um
reading stoicism and so you know the
idea of the logos or the underlying
logic of of of the world makes a lot of
sense to me. There's a ton of you know a
lot of a lot of ways in which stoicism
and Catholicism are quite similar and
and so I love and and I honestly have
been so in the just race of building
inflection. I haven't had a chance to
really sit back and and ponder some of
these things, but I think the the
tie-ins between quantum and religion and
philosophy are fascinating. Um, even
just at the most basic level of religion
has always sort of seemed to occupy that
space between human understanding and
and what we don't understand. So, you
know, when thunder would go off, uh,
that must have been something that the
gods did, right? But once we understood
what that was, it shrank that space. But
quantum still very much occupies that
space right it it doesn't really make
intuitive sense to us and so I think
there is a chance that maybe that is the
you know the layer where you can start
to think of uh the higher power residing
in some way maybe or or maybe not maybe
we'll figure it out and then it you know
religion will occupy a different space
but I do think it's a really interesting
topic to explore and and and and
you know I'll I'll see these posts on
and I'll I'll never really dig into them
but you know like that that you know
quantum is the only way to give AI uh
actual spirit or or make it make it um
make it you know conscious right it's
going to give it consciousness and so I
I wish I and maybe someday I'll sit back
and would love to talk to you more about
this kind of stuff offline because I
found it fascinating but I I do think
there is something there at the very at
the very most basic level and it's uh
it's fascinating to to let your mind go
to those places to think about.
>> Now, this is, you know, because I don't
need a solid ground under my feet. You
know, I've gone down all this rabbit
hole and I consider myself agnostic
atheist. So, it's very if and I have a
huge respect for having something to
believe it because it gives you some
kind of structure and substance to hold
on to. I don't need that. So, any
psychedelic experience where reality
dissolves, I say, well, this is normal.
This is just um if you have a computer,
you have a simulation, you don't have to
render everything into perfect pixels.
You can just have it could dissolve. And
so to me, I don't I don't need that
structures. I can dance between u the
explicable and the dimension of whatever
you want to call it. So, so it's very
fast. I'm very privileged to learn from
all these very smart people and to
listen to them how they are kind of sort
of held hostage in their own domain
while
>> so so my my co-author just published a
very interesting paper on the quantum
memory matrix where he argues that any
information in the universe is start in
a in a quantum memory matrix. So
basically meaning is information and and
and it just then could collapse into
some kind of a big crunch a singularity
where in a black hole information is
stored and that has been peer-reviewed
published and the first thing that he
got then was well this is aashic records
so you just see that the whole dimension
of spirituality and some kind of
holistic universe there are so many ways
to go about and and and I 100% agree
with you we have gone through history
where we have thin sliced uh what we you
know claimed to be godly and put a put a
label a math formula on it and I think
that's where we're heading we're moving
towards the unification of mythology
folklore and enlightenment basically
where science and philosophy could meet
so so I think a lot about I have the the
privilege of not being responsible for a
bunch of people in my organization so I
could sit down and think about this
But but I resonate very much with your
drive because it has become to me also
now a passion to actually build it. So I
so I have this vision to to quote
unquote build a human being uh by
applying this and uh I I literally hope
I fail because it takes away the magic.
Um but just totally
>> all the dimension that you mentioned we
talked about that on that path to
understanding uh what you know qualia
consciousness life at a cellular level
is there is so much business and I think
that and that's what I liked about your
you know values and philosophy that um
capitalism more power to it if it serves
for the benefit of humanity and we can
use technology for progress. So um this
was also something that I wanted to just
you know uh get a feeling because I read
a little bit about your your um you know
your your drive towards improving the
state of humanity and I think that's
very very important in today's world to
have leaders that unite those values. Um
so yeah thank you
>> I totally agree. Yeah I agree it's it's
really important.
>> Yeah. So you think the brain is a
quantum computer or is it something
magical then there is no some godliness
to it or uh
>> boy I don't yeah I I still you know
until maybe scientifically proven wrong
I still think you know that that God
plays an element in there but you know
that that could be he just you know
designed the quantum computer or
something right so I I I I don't know
it's it's it's it is I I
I default to my you know that my my uh
my my religious beliefs, but I don't
honestly I haven't thought deeply enough
about those even in so long, especially
after having gone down the quantum
rabbit hole. And I I do need to go sit
in a dark room and just think and get my
head straight on all these things.
>> Yeah.
What what a beautiful way to end the
hour, Matt, to take us back from a um
you know, a capitalisticdriven
investor that has a a deep passion for
deep technologies going into the role of
the CEO driving towards going public and
then taking it back to religion. I think
that was
>> we've covered it all. We've covered it
all, Andrew. Yeah.
>> Again, Matt, thank you so much for doing
this with me, spending so much time.
This was a blast. Yeah. Congrats on your
your all the things that you're doing.
Uh I'm going to follow inflection and I
hope to to have a chat with you on or
offline at uh at a later point or in a
near future.
>> I'd love that. I'd love it. Yep. Well,
thank you for this and thanks for having
me on the show.
>> Thank you so much, Matt.
>> Yeah.
