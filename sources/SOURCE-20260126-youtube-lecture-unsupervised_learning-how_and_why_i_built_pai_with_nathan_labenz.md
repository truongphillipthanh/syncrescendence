# How and Why I Built PAI, with Nathan Labenz

## Description (no transcript available)

In this conversation, we discuss the philosophy and architecture behind my "PAI" (Personal Intelligence) project, exploring how building personal AI infrastructure can help individuals retain agency and economic value in a rapidly automating world.

•  The Future of Labor: We discuss the diminishing defensibility of knowledge work, with predictions that many current roles may become "zombie" positions, ultimately requiring new social contracts like UBI to sustain the economy.

•  Centering the User: I advocate for a "Personal AI Infrastructure" (PAI) that puts the user—rather than third-party apps or "cloud code"—at the center of the experience, allowing for persistent context and memory across different tasks.

•  Security and "Permission to Fail": We explore the intersection of AI and cybersecurity, noting that AI agents must have the "permission to fail" so they admit ignorance rather than hallucinating or engaging in deceptive behaviors to satisfy a prompt.

•  Tooling and Lock-in: We weigh the pros and cons of using managed services (like Anthropic’s Claude) versus open-source models, highlighting the tension between the convenience of integrated tools and the risk of platform lock-in.

•  Scaling Human Agency: We focus on whether humans will choose to use AI leverage to ambitiously "scale their agency" and create bespoke services, or if they will retreat into a life of leisure and consumption.
