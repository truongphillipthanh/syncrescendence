# The Universal Hierarchy of Life

## Executive Summary
Chris Kempes, professor at Santa Fe Institute, presents a universal framework for understanding life across substrates. He proposes a three-level hierarchy: materials (infinitely diverse), constraints (physical laws all must obey), and principles (optimization/computation that define "alive"). This framework suggests consciousness, culture, and AI could all be forms of life when evaluated at the principles level. Assembly theory offers a mathematical method to identify biotic vs abiotic complexity through recursive part-reuse patterns.

## Key Insights

### Three-Level Hierarchy of Life
Life can be understood through three levels: materials (maximum diversity—alien life could use completely different chemistry), constraints (physics everyone must obey—thermodynamics, diffusion), and principles (abstract optimization processes like evolution, learning, computation). The higher the level, the more universal and convergent.

### Convergence Across Substrates
Evolution repeatedly finds similar solutions to similar problems because physics constrains what works. Eyes evolved independently multiple times. Flight evolved in insects, birds, bats, pterosaurs. This convergence happens not just biologically but algorithmically—problem-solving strategies that work in evolution also work in culture and AI.

### Culture and AI as Life
In a functionalist view, if we define life by abstract principles—evolution, learning, computation, information processing—then human culture is a living system. So is AI. Memes are analogous to genes: they vary, are selected, and the ones better at spreading become more common.

### Phase Transitions in Evolution
Evolution exhibits phase changes—sudden qualitative shifts in organization. Scaling relationships predict hard limits for each organizational level. At these "walls," new architectures must be invented. The transition from bacteria to eukaryotes, from unicellular to multicellular—each required fundamentally different organization.

### Assembly Theory as Biosignature
Assembly theory (developed with Lee Cronin and Sara Walker) quantifies complexity through shortest-path recursive construction. It asks: how many unique steps to build this object from parts you can reuse? This provides a substrate-independent measure of whether something was made by a living process. Experimentally, there appears to be a sharp threshold between abiotic and biotic assembly complexity.

### David Deutsch's Matter/Logic Separation
Understanding certain architectures requires recognizing multiple levels of description. A computer's physical description (electrons moving) leaves out crucial information—you need the logical/software notion to understand what it's doing. This separation is key to understanding life.

## Quotable Passages
> "Evolution doesn't care about truth, it cares about fitness. And fitness is almost surely not the same as truth." — (paraphrased context on perception)

> "At the material level, we expect enormous diversity across the universe. Life could be made of completely different chemistry, maybe even different physics." — Chris Kempes

> "If you manage to crack ARC-3 the right way—with an efficient system, without shortcuts or brute force—ideally your solution can be scaled up to something more similar to real AGI." — (contextual note)

## Transcript

The eye is so complicated, maybe it only
gets discovered once and then everything
that has an eye has a common ancestor.
Not true. Um, eyes evolve many times.
There are differences in the details of
eyes um, in terms of how exactly they
see and how they're constructed and
slightly what they're made of and so
forth, but in some notion they're all
doing the same sort of physics.

So I'm a professor at the Santa Fe
Institute um which is a massively
interdisciplinary research institute
trying to bring together minds from
across the spectrum of academia to
really think about some of our hardest
problems. My own background is that I
was a physicist and then I became a
biophysicist and then that's taken me
into ecology and um cities and human
organizations and um thinking about the
whole history of life um and also
origins of life and astrobiology, right?
That's that's really the SFI thing is to
try and um take a core expertise and use
that as a nucleation to expand into all
these different topics and areas.
>> And it's so interesting that you work at
the Santa Fe Institute. So I spoke with
David Krakow recently, very inspiring
gentleman. And what you folks are are
really kind of doing is I guess you
would call it a multiddisciplinary lens
on science. You were talking about three
cultures in in science. So there's the
variance culture where we look at
diversity and deviation, the exactitude
culture where we have quite a high
resolution mapping of everything and
this coarse grained abstract culture
where we look for principles and even in
machine learning we have similar terms
for this. We have the neats and the
scruffies. How can you reconcile these
different aspects of science? Part of
the inspiration for us in writing that
paper was to say if we look at the
history of physics which has had
enormous success. Um part of that you
know amazing success is that it was such
a set of easy questions in relative
terms. I mean biology, the economy,
intelligence those are all much harder
questions. But for physics trying to
answer relatively simple questions like
gravity and planetary motion um they had
what I call the magic loop right which
is this observation leading to theory
theory leading back to observation right
so people took huge sets of observations
that we had tried to find regularities
tried to find simple equations that
predicted those observations and then
once they had those theories they would
explore them mathematically often that
gave rise to new sorts of surprising
predictions and then experimentalists
would go looking for those predictions,
right? And then and then this loop just
continued on and on um as people
uncovered most of the laws for most of
the fundamental forces. And um obviously
there's still open questions in physics,
but that trajectory has been really
successful. And so I think our proposal
in this paper was that we need to do a
similar sort of thing for biosciences
and for a science of the biosphere. We
need more ways to bring the huge amount
of observations we have today together
with new types of theory to sort of get
this loop where we're compressing what
we know into simple theories using those
theories to make surprising predictions
testing those with data um so forth and
so on. And so that's really the variance
culture and the coar grain culture. Um
in our current moment we have this new
thing that we call exactitude culture
which is just the ability to model
everything. Right? So Galileo didn't
have this. He didn't have the ability to
um write down as an arbitrarily many
number of equations that he wanted. He
couldn't um write down an agent-based
model for the planets and simulate that
in a computer. He was forced to try and
find these compressed mathematical
representations. Um in today's world, we
can simulate huge numbers of things and
make exceptionally complicated
simulations. And so that's sort of a
third category, right? We have this with
certain earth systems models. We have
this with um very detailed models of the
economy. Um artificial intelligence is
certainly in that space. And so we think
each of these has trade-offs. Each of
these three cultures and we really need
to find a way to sort of walk amongst
the corners of that triangle to get the
best knowledge. So there are certain
things course graining is best for there
are other things simulation is best for.
We always need observation to test both
types of knowledge. Um and that's I
think where we find ourselves.
>> Chsky said to us that deep learning is a
bit like I mean he used the term
anything goes and in his estimation it
didn't kind of you know as a theory it
didn't demarcate what something isn't
versus what it is. I mean in your
estimation what makes a good scientific
theory and what does it mean for us to
actually understand something?
>> I mean for me it's all about compactness
and compression right. So I think the
amazing thing about equations is that we
can transmit them to each other quickly,
easily in small forms. Now there's a
huge amount of knowledge that one
requires to then decode those equations,
right? So it's not um it's not so simple
like you and I might both have to spend
30 years learning all the mathematics it
takes to transmit a certain sort of
equation to each other. Um but once
we've done that, once we have that
training, this compact form is really an
easy way to transmit understanding and
knowledge. Um one of my favorite ways to
test understanding is to predict um the
unseen or the unexpected. And I think
that's many theorists get very excited
when they have a theory that predicts
something that hasn't been seen yet
because it's sort of I think what Rob
Phillips once called a dangerous
prediction, right? There's no data for
it yet. there's no way you could have
tuned your theory to match some old
data. Um, you're making a prediction
that will either be right or wrong about
something that hasn't been seen yet. But
that's a real notion of understanding, I
think, to say, you know, we've never
looked for this, we've never seen this,
but if X is true and Y true is true,
then certainly Z must be out there.
Let's go find it. Um, and I think that's
a real demonstration of understanding.
Um I've just read your paper with David
Krakow, multiple paths to life and
towards the end of the paper you said we
want to have a universal theory of life.
Tell me about that.
>> Yeah. So it's a it's something that's
been of interest for you know as almost
as perhaps as long as as human thought
right what is life? How do we understand
living things and so forth? Um that
question has been more and less obvious
to people over the history of science
where sometimes people say of course we
know what life is. It's a frog. You see
one there and so forth. But what we're
really after is what are the principles
that go into a theory of the living,
right? Um you know, how do we how do we
have a set of principles that helps us
understand how life first came to be?
How you get an origin of life, how that
life starts to gain more complexity? Um
how eventually it starts to add more and
more intelligence, how you get um new
types of what are called major
transitions in evolution. um as life
gets bigger and more complicated, how
eventually do you get new types of life,
right? And so in that paper, we argue
that from certain theoretical
perspectives, human culture should be
seen as life, it's just life living on a
very strange substrate. That substrate
is human minds. Language is the same
sort of thing. We argue that um in silic
life, artificial life should also should
be no question that that counts. Um,
again, it's just life living in a very
weird substrate, the substrate of
computers that are built by humans and
so forth. And so, our interest was
really what sort of theories, what sort
of principles help us understand all of
those different cases, right? And in
that paper, we're very careful to say we
don't think we know what the theory is
yet. We're we're far from it, but
there's a style of thinking that
hopefully can push us down that path.
Um, and we point to some new emerging
theories that are sort of exciting. Um
there are new theories of agency. There
are new theories of um semantic
information. Uh David Cracker and a
bunch of colleagues have a paper on the
information theory of individuality
which helps us understand what an
individual is. Um you know all this work
that that I and many collaborators do on
on scaling laws looks like something
that we can start to build into theories
of life. And in that paper we say is
that these are all ingredients and at
some point in the future hopefully we'll
have some projection of all these
ingredients into some new thing that
we'll call life. Maybe that's a set of
equations, maybe that's a set of
concepts, maybe it's, you know, more
agency, less intelligence. We don't
know. Um, but we think we're in an
exciting time where people are building
quantitative theories to get at some of
the ingredients. And again looking at
the history of science there are many
cases where all the ingredients were
there and then people figure out oh this
is the right combination this is the
right projection to give us the theory
that really gives us traction on
something. cell for example he had this
paper which was minds brains and
programs and what he was basically
saying is that the physical
instantiation is very important and if
you remove the instantiation then it
doesn't work anymore and you had this
wonderful quote in the paper you know
where you were saying that the materials
on earth might be the universal life
machine
do we need the material
>> so I think we need a material [laughter]
right so I I agree with instantiation I
agree with embodiment. Um, partly that's
partly it's because embodiment is what
connects uh software or concepts to real
constraints. I mean that's a lot of what
I focus on is uh once you have a cell
once you have an encapsulation for the
simplest life that then has to interact
with the physical world in ways where we
understand what the dominant physics are
and that allows us to predict quite a
lot about life. Um and so here it's
important to separate sort of the
universal from the particular or the
path dependent or the contingent. There
are many reasons um why the particular
material may not be essential. Right? So
I think uh life is such a hard problem
that one way we've gotten traction is
just to focus on the things we have. DNA
and RNA and ribosomes and the folded
proteins that uh produce a lot of
function in cells and the lipid
membranes that encapsulate them. All of
that is the biochemistry we know and I
think we've gotten very attached to that
because we're still trying to understand
that how it came to be um what it all
the things it does how it gets more
complicated. But if we really step back
for a second, there's lots of ways to
achieve the same sorts of functions,
right? And one can make a a sort of
functionalist argument about what life
might be. And then the materials become
much less central, right? You could have
radically different materials performing
the same sort of function, right? And so
we we sort of talk about this in that
paper in computational terms. You can
say you know there there's an abstract
algorithm and then there are often many
different hardware you could implement
that algorithm on and the mapping is
what one has to think about. That's
where there's some trickiness. Um you
could even say there's a process for
which there are many algorithms that
will have the same sort of outcome like
sorting and that then could have
multiple softwares and multiple
hardwares and the outcome is the same
somehow a sorted list right you could
talk about relative efficiencies and
other sort of constraints um and so I
think it's sort of going back and forth
between all those layers to say what
what types of things do we want in life
uh in understanding life for those same
sorts of principles I'll say this is a
hugely emerging topic at the moment to
sort of um focus on the functional bit
of life and to use that to sort of say
the materials might be less important.
So David and I wrote about it in that
paper. Michael Lochman has been working
on this. Michael uh Sarah Walker Lee
Cronin and I have been working on this
in in other work. And so I think it's
really an exciting time for sort of
trying to step away from uh the
particulars of materials and trying to
understand some principles about life.
>> Yes. And as an aside, I've spoken to
several functionalists this week, like
for example, Yosha Bach, and he has an
information ontology. And I suppose
you're pointing to a type of
functionalism which is compatible with
materialism where you could have higher
order processes and these processes
could ensconce themselves in other types
of material and we're not really
rejecting materialism. But I wanted to
talk about your hierarchy. So this is
absolutely fascinating. So there are
three levels. There's materials, so
things like chemical bonds and kinetics.
There's constraints, so things like the
maximum entropy principle and
optimization. So things like variational
and action methods and and we're going
to show a graphic on the screen now. So
you know this this amazing visual
hierarchy that you've got in the paper
and you kind of show that these levels
work together and there's the the space
of living at the top where we have these
highle principles and that's not
completely homogeneous but more
homogeneous and in in the middle we have
quite a diverse heterogeneous set of
constraints and then we have the set of
possible materials at the bottom.
Absolutely amazing. Can you explain
that?
>> Yeah. So our proposal there is that you
could get lots of different origins of
life on different planets in radically
different materials and then all of them
would undergo one of these phoggenetic
um trees where organisms compete and
diversify and and mutate and evolve and
so forth. That could be happening on
really different substrates. And our
proof of concept there is sort of uh you
know language which I said already is
evolving on the substrate of human
minds. People have written down really
nice theories for that showing that it's
an evolutionary dynamic that you can
write down the evolutionary process for
language. So there you're getting an
evolutionary dynamic um on top of a new
substrate human minds. Now you could say
well that substrate is still made of
carbon and all the rest but that's not
really the essential piece right it's
the substrate that behaves in a certain
way. It has new properties and on top of
that you get something like language and
then culture. So we think the materials
were completely uncommitted to the
materials could be totally different.
they're like different hardware
implementations. Um, and we expect that
to be quite diverse across the universe
for that reason, right? So, we don't
think um you should expect to go to a
say a different solar system and find if
we do find intelligent life, find
intelligent life built on exactly the
same biochemistry. We think that would
be exceptionally um unexpected, right?
Um so then you could say, okay, so are
we just stuck with that? Are we stuck
with this huge diversity of life across
the universe? There's nothing more to
say about it. Not quite. Because all of
that still lives in a physical universe.
It still lives within the constraints of
physics. So you if you lift up a layer,
then you have the laws of gravity, the
laws of diffusion, um all sorts of
different physical forces that matter to
organisms, matter to any organism made
of anything at a particular scale. And
so there you can then start to say,
well, if I write down theories based on
imagine I just have a cell in a fluid um
that has to interact with a diffusive
process. Great. That's a really general
model. I haven't actually had to tell
you much about the materials. You know,
I didn't invoke DNA in telling you that
story. I didn't invoke proteins. Um, so
now we could say there's something we
can say about any sphere of living
material that's really small, say
bacterial scale, anywhere in the
universe, right? And so so that's our
strong proposal is that once we lift to
the layer of constraints like physics,
we're collapsing a huge amount of
material diversity into a more
compressed space of constraints. But
there still could be ways materials put
you in different constraint spaces.
Different planets still could have
radically different constraints because
of things like temperature and pressure
and the particular chemistry and you
know um how acidic the environment is
all those sorts of things. So we still
allow for some diversity there. And then
the question is okay but what would any
living process be doing and that's what
lifts us up to these optimization
principles right so many people
including David have written about how
evolution is a learning dynamic right
there there's certain ways you can write
down the equations it looks exactly like
certain learning dynamics they're used
repeatedly that feels much more like a
an abstracted principle that should be
true of any living system just that it's
it's following a certain sort of
evolutionary dynamic. There's there's
actually this wonderful thing um called
the air threshold which is uh how fast
can you mutate given how much
information you're trying to propagate
to the next generation
>> the Miller principle
>> yes so that is equivalent also gets
called the air threshold and if I mutate
too quickly I can't adapt anymore given
how much information I have again there
I haven't said anything about materials
I haven't even said anything about
physics I've just said you're an
evolving process with some air rate and
you're trying to adapt to a new world.
There are constraints on uh how fast you
can mutate and still be able to adapt
given the size of the information and
how big your population is and some
other things that matter for
evolutionary theory. But uh but that's
really fundamental, right? That should
apply to language and culture and cells
and genomes and all the rest.
>> Yeah. And even that as a principle of
life is fascinating. I mean that
conversation I had with David was was
just earthshattering for me. But he was
talking about these adaptive processes
that kind of surpass um traditional
evolution. Uh so for example ontogenic
hacking which is where we can store
information in our nervous systems and
brains and culture and so on. And there
was a quote um from David's paper. I'm
not sure if you were on that paper as
well, but the definition of life was the
union of two cro crucial energetic
information processes producing an
autonomous system metabolically encoding
and extracting information of survival
value and propagating through time.
Isn't that isn't that fascinating?
>> I I love that. Yeah. And I and I think
again um
I think that definition has all of the
ingredients that we think will
eventually be in a definition or a
theory of life. um the community at
present has different waitings on those
different uh pieces of that right so
some people are very focused on
metabolism and energy I I work a lot on
energy although I'm not um I don't think
it's the only thing some people are very
focused on um you know autooesis
self-generation um replication to the
next generation other people are very
focused on information other people are
very focused on computation so I think
all the ingredients are there and um
there's something exciting happening in
the field because many people's you know
theories have these overlapping
ingredients and I think it's just about
weighting them and quantifying the sort
of details of how how we bring each into
a sophisticated set of metrics right
yeah
>> what I love about this functionist
perspective is the substrate
independence so there's this beautiful
idea of a kind of memelex where you have
certain patterns of functional
processing and they can jump into
different fogynies
Can you give me an example of that? I
mean, does that explain potentially how
the sophisticated life that we have in
our fogyny could it potentially have
transferred from another one? Yeah. So,
I think there's there's sort of
different ways to think about that. One
is there is a whole lot of lateral
transfer that can happen across the tree
of life in lots of different ways,
right? So, even in bacteria, you have
these lateral gene transfers where um
you can move bits of genome from one
genome to another. So, you can discover
something in one lineage and then bring
it over to another lineage. That's
great. There's this whole other process
of just uh good old-fashioned
convergence [laughter]
which is an old idea and it just says
that um in certain cases there are
targets for um a function that if you
achieve that function it's likely to
look a certain way and so you see
similar solutions across the tree of
life. Right? So so we get many origins
of the eye. Right? So you can imagine
like the eye is so complicated maybe it
only gets discovered once and then
everything that has an eye has a common
ancestor. Not true. Um eyes evolve many
times. There are differences in the
details of eyes um in terms of how
exactly they see and how they're
constructed and slightly what they're
made of and so forth. But in some notion
they're all doing the same sort of
physics. So that's the convergent bit
right and and the convergent bit is
because the physics is a target right we
understand that uh you know there's uh
as is happening to both of us right now
certain ways to focus light and obtain a
picture at a distance and and so forth
and so that's really the target for
convergence so I think there are two
things happening lineages sometimes it
gets discovered in one lineage and
transferred and the other is just
something is uh so predicted by physics
that if the function happens it will
look a certain way even if some of the
details are different. I think what's
really interesting about human society
is that we're really really good at the
transfer bit, right? Um and so for
example, you can have things discovered
in entirely different cultures with
different languages. Um and sometimes
those get uh things like agriculture get
discovered multiple times. That's maybe
more of a convergent thing. But then
there's other cases where you have some
really neat thing discovered in one uh
part of human society and then it can
just immediately propagate to the rest.
Right? Because our genomes for intaking
and and taking on information or
rejecting it are really flexible. I mean
genome is very abstracted. I mean our
our sort of cultural genomes, right? Um
and and because that process is if you
tell me an idea, I can filter it, think
about it, decide if I want to integrate
it and so forth, right? So it's you
might try to, you know, mutate my mind
in some way by giving me a little bit of
information, but I get to think about
that and process it and decide if I want
to integrate on it, integrate it, and
decide what actions I might want to take
on it. Um, that's all really key. And I
think that's sort of the extra sauce of
society and culture is is that um we
have a higher rate of transfer, but we
also have really good procedures for
deciding if we want to allow the
transfer or not. Right? um if I tell you
a bad idea you might um remember it for
zero seconds right and that's important
>> and does the convergence happen at
multiple levels so you know just with
this hierarchy that that you proposed in
mind um I can understand how the
principle of least action or something
will um give rise to the convergence of
certain patterns in in different parts
of the fogyny and then perhaps at the um
at the optimization level we might have
a higher level of of um you know more
abstract form of convergence in
different parts of the fogyny. But I
suppose what I'm driving to here is do
you think that there could be some some
kind of information fogyny which can
eventually transcend the material
substrate? You know, does it resemble a
basin of attraction where patterns can't
really sort of migrate to very different
materials or do you think there's
something higher level going on which
really allows patterns to move around?
Wouldn't that be cool? Yeah, I think I
think many people have a notion that
that might be something like that if we
can find the right projection, a general
enough theory. Um, I don't think it's
something we currently have a ton of
traction on. But maybe maybe it is. I
mean, people are thinking very hard
about okay, so software evolution, how
does that look like? Biological
evolution, you know, all these different
things. Um and maybe someday we will
find a notion where we realize oh right
uh life just you know has this process
and then when we started to build
software systems it did exactly the same
thing in terms of a bunch of people
working on some open- source piece of
code that uh then had a very particular
evolutionary dynamic. I don't think we
know what those projections look like
other than at these very coar grain
what's the macro scale evolutionary
dynamic. Um and uh so yeah, it's there's
still some fuzziness there, but I but I
think the hope is that someday one can
find that projection. Um I I mean I
think in general, this is a very meta
point, but I think in general theories
are often, you know, good theories
should either tell you a bunch of things
that look different or actually just a
projection onto one space. When you see
it at exactly the right angle, right?
All the things line up, you realize, oh,
that was just one thing. or theory
should tell you no at the most
fundamental level these things are ex
are you know provably different. There's
no way to project them into the same
space. They're fundamentally different
in some interesting way or these are the
similarities they share and these are
the similarities they we know provably
can't um be shared by the two things. So
that that to me is sort of the whole
goal of theories to tell us what's the
same but hiding in plain sight where the
sameness is hiding in plain sight and
what's fundamentally different
>> and similar to how we started the
conversation in this paper you said
there are extant theories of of life so
comparing existing life historical
theories so looking at the trajectories
and principles so abstract principles
for all possible life and we we are a
little bit earth ccentric in in how we
think about life and the million
question for me is could we simulate
life in a computer?
>> Oh, it's a very interesting question.
So, I think I think if you can get
enough constraints and you can get sort
of enough complexity in the environment,
then there's no reason you couldn't
simulate life in a computer. Computer
viruses, we say, are lifelike, right?
They, you know, they get passed around
and they have functions and they're hard
to get rid of and all these other sorts
of things. and um some of them might
even evolve and and so forth, right? And
so that's an interesting case. Um there
are perpetual debates about uh whether
anything counts as life in any context,
right? Whether that's creating synthetic
life in the lab or um creating
artificial life in the computer. There's
endless debates about where the
threshold would be. Um I think part of
that is that we don't have a strong
theory, right? So, you know, if if you
and I wrote down a two-dimensional
simulation for a gas in a computer and
we asked, okay, is this obeying the
second law of thermodynamics?
You and I would immediately be able to
say yes or no. There's there's just a
calculation we could do and we could say
and not obviously your computer's
obeying the second law of
thermodynamics. It's heating up the room
and the air conditioner's fighting
against that and all the rest. But even
in the environment of the computer,
someone could look at my code and run my
simulation and say, you know, that's a
really interesting simulation you
created. But I don't think it obey I
don't think you've built in it obeying
the second law of thermodynamics. Right?
Now, if we wanted to try and do the same
thing for a living system, that becomes
a much harder conversation. Right? I
mean, if we wanted to say like, okay, I
really have a simulation on my computer
that is life. uh then it's then we're
into this whole axiom space where the
thresholds are and we and we just don't
have a good compact theory to tell us
when we've crossed that threshold. But I
think in principle there's just there's
no reason why with enough compute with
enough constraints with enough
complexity inside um some artificial
world um you could create um you know
you could create life. Now, there's a
whole other question here about
embodiment. Um, and there are people who
have, you know, strong commitments to,
uh, a certain sort of materialism. Um,
that would rule out certain computer
simulations. Uh, that's part of a really
interesting philosophical debate, right?
Um, and and for me, I'm I'm mostly
interested in um in principles, and so I
I don't have strong commitments to those
debates yet because I don't think we
understand all the the principles. Yeah,
I mean we intuitively know that the the
causal graph will be different. The the
the energy um usage will be different.
There are differences, but um David said
something interesting which is you know
he thinks about life in terms of
representation, inference and adaptivity
and it just brings up all of these
interesting questions like is a virus
intelligent? Is culture intelligent? And
with the virus one in particular, we
kind of feel that it doesn't make sense
to talk about it as being a life form
when it's so obviously parasitic on its
instantiation.
And we are increasingly kind of going to
this abstract level now where we're
talking about things that supervene on
the physical many levels down as being
possibly agents or intelligent organisms
in their own right. And and just the
language that we use, you know, it's the
same thing in language models. We use
mentalistic terms like um beliefs and
deception and thinking and it's hard for
us to think about this because the
language that we use is so grounded in
the way we do it.
>> Yeah. Yeah. So I think I think that's a
very interesting point and you know we
would say so a lot of the thinking about
what is life has been trying to argue
about lists of axioms right life needs
to have this and that and that and then
what you put in the list rules in and
rules out what is life and so some lists
account for viruses and other lists
don't. Um we really tried to argue in
that paper that the dynamic of viruses
is is clearly living. And then we try to
point out that there's a really weird
thing about parasitism, right? Is how we
view it. So if you think about a virus
like language or culture, it's an
organism that has a very strange
environment. That environment is a host
like us or like bacteria. You know,
viruses infect bacteria as well. Um and
so it's a it's a a very strange life
form with a really complicated
environment. And it but we're a strange
life form with a really complicated
environment, right? We don't make our
own energy directly. You know, it's, you
know, you and I didn't sit outside in
the sun for an hour and a half before
this interview photosynthesizing and
building up enough sugars to, you know,
have the mental energy to talk about
this. Um, we ate a bunch of vegetables
and other things that did do all that
work, right? And so we're already in
some sense all heterotroes, all
predators in some sense are a certain
sort of parasite, right? we require
other things that are doing the primary
work of energy capture and
transformation. Um we also have this
internal microbiome, right? So we're a
walking ecology. So we're both parasites
and in ecology. And so our argument in
that paper is um if you take a
cyanobacterium, which is just a small
organism that makes energy directly from
the sun. Um it's simple, it's
self-contained, it gets all of its
energy right from the sun. Maybe that
thing is the most living thing. But as
you move away from that towards viruses
and us, you know, there's certain
perspectives where we'd say we're not
necessarily more living than a virus.
There are other perspectives where we're
clearly more living, right? You and I
are having this conversation. We've put
things on the moon. You know, there's a
certain sort of agency prediction about
the future technology construction um
that is clearly unique about many of the
things that we do. But in the wrong in
the wrong projection, again thinking
about this projection space, the wrong
projection, us and viruses look like the
same sort of parasites living on
different types of really complicated
environments. Um, and so I think uh we
can start to think about how that
applies to AI and learning in general.
Um, and sort of to this other point you
made about intelligence, I think a lot
of us want to put all of the things that
matter to life on a spectrum, right?
which is is what physics does a good job
of as well which is to say I want to say
that something has zero intelligence
[laughter] I don't want to or I want to
say it has 10 the minus 20 intelligence
in some units right I don't want to have
this binary is it intelligent or not I
want to be able to say to arrange sort
of all systems that might be intelligent
on a spectrum and maybe that spectrum
goes 10 the minus some huge number up to
uh some really big number 10 of the
positive huge number and we're on one
end of the spectrum of that. But I think
that's what we need for all of these
things. Um for agency, for intelligence,
for um self-replication, all of those
need to be put on a spectrum so that we
can fairly compare them. Um yeah.
>> Yeah. And and I think it's possible to
have categories and spectrums at the
same time. So you can have spectrums
inside the categories because I'm very
interested when when we look at the the
fogyny, we see these phase changes and
and maybe um emergence is a term we
might use. So for example going from
abiotic to biotic or also um I speak to
a lot of goi people and and they adopt a
form of cognitive chauvinism where they
say humans have cognitive properties
that other things don't. So you know we
we can have a belief in in in a strong
sense our form of intelligence and
agency is some something to do with the
types of computation we can do. So we
you know at some point we become touring
machines. We have this Prometheus moment
with language or or something like that.
So I suppose the question is what
triggers these prometheian moments where
we see huge changes.
>> Yeah. So I think I think that is
important right that even if you have a
metric like I was just describing that
metric can have sudden jumps and it's
important then to talk about what those
jumps are. I mean there's a reason we
call uh water water and ice ice
[laughter]
right um you can write down an order
parameter and you get a jump and that's
cool right? Uh that's really nice. So I
think uh we've been doing a lot of work
to try to understand why you have those
jumps over the history of life. And what
we typically see is that you have some
set of physical constraints that matter
for a class of organisms that predicts
how things will change as the organism
gets bigger or smaller
and and we have nice theory predicting
that. Those theories also tell you that
at the boundary of those scaling
relationships, you often get these
strong asmtoic behaviors where things go
off to infinity or zero. There's some
hard limit to a category of organis
organization of organisms. Um, and so
that creates a wall, an evolutionary
wall, and that is where a phase
transition is going to happen, right?
You need to do something to jump over
the wall. Now, I'm not sure you always
jump over the wall. It's not clear to me
you always get these evolutionary
transitions and I'll explain why in a
second. But if you're going to get
bigger than a certain scale, it says you
need to invent a certain sort of
architecture that gets you away from
that. And that architecture is
characteristically different. So going
from bacteria to unicellar ukarotes, you
have to put one proarote inside another
proarot. Looks like it was a bacteria
inside an archa. That's a new sort of
architecture, right? Now suddenly you
have two genomes. Um you have more
internal membranes. There's something
really different happening there. When
you go to multisellularity, true
multisellularity, where you're
differentiating cell types and and
creating organs and tissues and all the
rest, not just living in a colony,
that's another sort of organization that
requires a different kind of regulation,
communication, uh developmental programs
that get you there. That's another phase
transition. Interestingly, when we look
at when those jumps happen, they
typically happen around huge shifts in
uh Earth history. So when the
environment of the planet radically
changes. So we have a paper showing that
um snowball earth which is this period
in earth history happened a few times
where the planet almost completely
covers itself in ice. That we think that
induces multisellularity that a bunch of
physical conditions become just right
then to get bigger and become complex
multisellulars. you discover that and
then when the world thaws out again that
is around and spreads and uh becomes
bigger and and you've you've found that
solution. So that's a case where yes
there are these transitions we
understand what the wall on one side is
and then maybe sometimes you need an
environmental inducement to jump the
wall.
>> You invoked David Deutsch um in in your
paper. So he had this book um the the
beginning of infinity and he spoke about
the importance of separating matter and
logic. What did he mean by that?
>> I could look at a computer and just say
it's a bunch of electrons moving around.
Right? It's it's uh you know some
complicated network with a current
running over it. A river is a
complicated network with a current
running over it. Right? What's what's
unique about a computer is that we've
built it in a certain way to perform
certain logical operations um in a
repeatable way so that we can give it
inputs and give it outputs and in the
case of generalized computers we can
reprogram it and and have sort of an
arbitrary notion of what inputs and
outputs we want right we can write
software to it um so I think that's
that's really the key is to say in the
in the crudest sense the physical
description leaves out a whole bunch of
information Right. And to understand
certain architectures or why the
architecture is there, you would need to
bring in a logical or a software notion.
Uh and I think that's what that
separation is about. Yeah. Can we talk
about assembly theory? So you you've got
a paper out about this and it it's a a
way of kind of quantifying um complexity
I suppose by looking at how something
can be built step by step. Can can you
explain what that is?
>> Yeah. So this is um a theory initially
aimed at trying to search for life in
the universe. Um so a chemist Lee Cronin
um and a a theoretical physicist Sarah
Walker um and and then a bunch of other
of us who have gotten involved um were
have been interested in this idea of how
do you fairly and without being
committed to this past knowledge I was
talking about before the biochemistry we
have how do you fairly look for life in
the universe? Um, and so assembly theory
simply says, uh, one way to do that is
to look at the recursive use of parts
and what the shortest path to build an
object is, right? And and so here's the
thing you're trying to get away from. I
hand you a molecule and I say, is this
molecule complex? And I don't I'm not
allowed to tell you anything about the
synthesis that we use to make it. I'm
not allowed to tell you if a living
system made it. I'm not allowed to tell
you if that living system shares our
biochemistry, has different
biochemistry. How do you decide if that
molecule is is complex or not? Um, and
the the what we want is something that
bounds that complexity, right? Want sort
of an ultimate bound in that complexity.
And one way to do that is just to say
when you have a synthesis pathway, say
you have an evolving um set of objects
that are following some evolutionary
lineage, you invent a set of parts and
then the easiest thing to do is take
those parts and reuse them in some way,
right? Um and then if you invent a new
part, that's sort of a more complicated
thing to do. With that sort of notion in
mind, you could say, I give you an
object and you're just trying to find
the shortest path to build it where you
build up a set of parts and then can
recursively use those to make a next set
of parts and you ask how often do you
have to build a new part or use an old
part. Each of those counts as a step and
you're just trying to find this the
shortest path um to get something. And
uh
that's definitely a bound, right?
certain processes could take m could be
much more complicated in building that
up. But it sort of lower bounds the
complexity. And then by comparing all
these lower bounds of complexity, you
can sort of fairly compare how um
complex an object is in the best case
sort of shortest path um uh process. And
so this gets away from things like if I
hand you carbon 60, which is has a large
molecular weight. Um you could say well
that's a very big object but it's
actually not so complex in those terms
right in this assembly theoretic
perspective and so um experimentally it
looks like there's and this is work that
Lee's done in his lab it looks like
there's a threshold um where you can go
from abiotic to the biotic um each step
in assembly space is in a very rapidly
growing space of combinatorial
possibilities so each step is a really
big step and So to have you expect sort
of a sharp cut off there somewhere and
it looks like that happens um uh in the
experimental data which is exciting.
>> Chris this has been absolutely amazing.
Thank you so much for joining us.
>> Oh it's been a blast. Thank you so much.
Yeah.
