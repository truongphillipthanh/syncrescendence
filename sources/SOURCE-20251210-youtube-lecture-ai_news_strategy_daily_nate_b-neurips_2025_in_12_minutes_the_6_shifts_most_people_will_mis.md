_______________________
What's really happening inside the world's premier AI research conference? The common story is that NeurIPS reveals cutting-edge breakthroughs — but the reality is a signal-to-noise crisis buried under 20,000 paper submissions and corporate trade-show noise.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on the research threads actually moving LLMs and AI agents forward:

 • Why new attention mechanisms will make models cheaper and smarter
 • How frontier models are converging toward identical responses
 • What reinforcement learning breakthroughs mean for robotics and automation
 • Where major labs are shifting focus from model size to reasoning and efficiency

Chapters:
00:00 - What Happened at NeurIPS 2025
02:22 - Better Attention, Model Homogeneity, and Scaling RL
06:40 - Diffusion Models and IP Concerns
07:50 - The AI Research Slop Crisis
09:10 - What Big Labs Are Focusing on in 2026

For operators and builders, the takeaway is clear: trusting conference brands alone is over — you need your own filters for separating real advances from padded noise.
