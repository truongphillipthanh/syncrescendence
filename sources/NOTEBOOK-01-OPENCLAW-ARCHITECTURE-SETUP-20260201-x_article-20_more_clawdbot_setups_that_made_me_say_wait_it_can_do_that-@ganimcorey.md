## Overview

(Description: Hero image showing "clawdbot in action. 20 real uses." with illustration of an orange claw-themed robot character and a badge showing "20" in red)

Part 1 blew up.

90K views. 2,300+ bookmarks. Hundreds of DMs asking for more.

So I went hunting again.

20 more Clawdbot setups from the wild - automations that made me stop scrolling and screenshot immediately.

Steal freely.

PS: I'm building a one-click Clawdbot install.

## 4. Voice Call Plugin - Your Bot Makes Phone Calls

[@steipete](https://x.com/@steipete) built a TypeScript voice call plugin so Clawdbot can now make actual phone calls on your behalf.

> Wrote a voice call plugin (yes @openclaw has a really cool TypeScript based plugin-arch now so code stays lean) and the bots install it before it's even released ^^
>
> Anyhow, Clawd can now do phone calls for you!

Reply from [@xz3dev](https://x.com/@xz3dev):
> Yes. I literally just told clawd to install it. I could've probably done it myself but I guess it figured it out fast enough. Btw using minimax 2.1 - works like a charm.

(Description: Screenshots showing TypeScript code for voice call plugin installation with configuration options and setup dialogue)

## 5. Alexa CLI for Smart Home Control

[@buddyhadry](https://x.com/@buddyhadry) built an Alexa CLI to control all Alexa-enabled smart home devices with natural language text commands via Clawdbot.

## 14. 5 Email Accounts + Calendars + iMessages + Meeting Transcripts

[@stevecaldwell](https://x.com/@stevecaldwell) gave Clawdis access to 5 email accounts, calendars, iMessages via BlueBubbles, and Granola meeting transcripts - set itself up via WhatsApp.

> One of my holiday goals was to get my sh*t together and build myself a proper AI assistant. I spend my day bouncing between multiple Claude Code / Codex sessions and sometimes too many meetings. I've got three kids, two businesses, one wife, and virtually zero time to build systems that make my life better.
>
> The data is all there, I just need to bring it together and make sense of it.
>
> This week, I stumbled upon this awesome agent workflow writeup by @steipete where he mentions what he's building at clawdis.ai, and I was intrigued.
>
> This is a very appealing AI assistant. Seems like exactly what I'm looking for. So I asked Claude Code to set up Clawdis on a headless Mac Mini on my LAN.
>
> After I pointed it to some credentials, my Clawdis ("Crawdad" 🦞) quite literally did the rest, setting itself up, all via WhatsApp. I gave it access to my 5 email accounts, calendars, iMessages (via BlueBubbles server), and Granola transcripts.
>
> This stuff rarely works the first time. It was awesome.
>
> Then, earlier today, we had a real Jarvis moment.
>
> I was in my car waiting on my wife to emerge from the store, so I sent Crawdad a voice message. I hadn't configured OpenAI API keys for transcribing my voice, so I asked it to try to install and use whisper.cpp (via WhatsApp), and it "just worked", and will use this method going forward.

> Clawdbot truly is next level - haven't been this excited about AI in a long time! Spent the whole weekend setting it up, now my sassy AI assistant Amy is finally running persistently on my Home Assistant box. I felt like a kid in the toy store, discovering new ways to make AI really useful. Reminds me of when I got my first computer and started figuring out all the things you could do with it - only this is even cooler and more useful.

Quote from [@internetvin](https://x.com/@internetvin):
