## Claim (3)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260109-565-0001
**Lines**: 17-19
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> AI enables active systems rather than passive storage, which is a more complex reality than the common understanding of second brains as merely better note-taking.

**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> It is now possible to build systems that operate autonomously, classifying thoughts, closing open loops, and providing relevant nudges without requiring engineering expertise.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260109-565-0004
**Lines**: 24-24
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> An 'AI loop' involves automatically classifying, routing, and surfacing information.

## Framework (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260109-565-0005
**Lines**: 37-45
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Eight building blocks for effective second brain systems are: The Drop Box (frictionless capture), The Sorter (AI classification), The Form (schema and data structure), The Filing Cabinet (memory store), The Receipt (audit trail), The Bouncer (confidence filter), The Tap on the Shoulder (daily nudges), and The Fix Button (easy corrections).

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260109-565-0006
**Lines**: 46-52
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Twelve principles for building second brain systems are: One Reliable Human Behavior, Separate Memory/Compute/Interface, Treat Prompts Like APIs, Build Trust Mechanisms, Default to Safe Behavior, Small/Frequent/Actionable Outputs, Use Next Action as Execution Unit, Prefer Routing Over Organizing, Keep Categories Painfully Small, Design for Restart Not Perfection, Build Core Loop Then Add Modules, and Optimize for Maintainability Over Cleverness.

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260109-565-0002
**Lines**: 21-22
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> An AI second brain can be built using tools like Slack, Notion, Zapier, and Claude or ChatGPT.
