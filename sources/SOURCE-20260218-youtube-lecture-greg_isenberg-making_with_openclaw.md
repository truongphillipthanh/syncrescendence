# Making $$$ with OpenClaw

## Description (no transcript available)

I sit down with Nick Vasilescu, founder of Orgo, to break down exactly how people are turning OpenClaw — the open-source computer use agent — into a real revenue stream. Nick walks me through live demos of deploying OpenClaw for business clients, shows how sub-agents and parallelization multiply output, and shares his design-thinking framework for identifying and automating high-value workflows. We even build a TikTok trend-hunting agent from scratch during the episode to prove how fast you can go from idea to working prototype.

Key Points

* OpenClaw is more than a personal assistant — it is a deployable business tool that can automate end-to-end workflows for paying clients.
* The fastest path to revenue is finding automation jobs on Upwork (RPA, desktop automation, workflow building) and fulfilling them with OpenClaw and Claude Code.
* Sub-agents allow your main OpenClaw instance to delegate specialized tasks, keeping the orchestrator free and multiplying throughput through parallelization.
* A design-thinking approach — mapping automation opportunities by value vs. effort — is essential before building anything.
* Verticalizing computer use agents for a specific industry (manufacturing, real estate, distributorships) is the major startup opportunity Andreessen Horowitz is calling out.
* Always start by building a lightweight MVP skill, test it, debug, and iterate before scaling.

Numbered Section Summaries

1) OpenClaw Setup and Deployment Options

Nick demonstrates how easy it is to install OpenClaw on a virtual machine using Orgo, though he makes clear you can use Manus, Kimi, a Mac Mini, or any setup you prefer. He spins up a workspace for me in under a minute — just a curl command in the terminal and it is ready. The point: the barrier to entry is nearly zero.

2) The Wedge: Finding Business Automation Opportunities

The viral demos on Twitter are fun but toyish. The real money is in identifying a specific workflow inside a business — like downloading product data from a legacy platform and uploading it into a Zoho CRM — and automating that end to end. Nick calls this the "wedge" and it is the foundation of the entire business model.

3) Sub-Agents and Parallelization

OpenClaw can spawn up to eight sub-agents, each with its own computer. Nick shows two parallelization strategies: splitting one task across multiple agents, or running the same task across multiple instances for volume. He spawned sub-agents to scrape Upwork jobs, build demo proposals, and pick the best one — all automatically.

4) The Upwork Hack

If you have zero clients, Upwork is the starting point. People are posting $500–$5,000 jobs right now asking for AI workflow automation, desktop automation, and RPA replacements. Nick's approach: find the job, give the context to OpenClaw or Claude Code, build a demo, and submit the proposal. It is a lead generation machine.

5) Design Thinking for Automation

Before touching any code, Nick maps every potential automation on two axes: value created and effort/cost/time. You start with high-value, low-effort opportunities — the low-hanging fruit. Then you map out the step-by-step workflow in Figma (or Mermaid code for ExcaliDraw/TLDraw) so OpenClaw can execute tip to tail.
