## Analogy (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-013-0011
**Lines**: 44-45
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Ars Contexta provides agents with a structure to think with, similar to how Ars Memoriae offered places for memory and Ars Combinatoria provided wheels for combining ideas.

## Claim (6)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-013-0001
**Lines**: 6-9
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.90, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.90

> Every knowledge worker eventually encounters a limitation where ideas accumulate faster than they can be organized, leading to a backlog of unsynthesized raw material.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-013-0003
**Lines**: 15-16
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Current AI agents lack an equivalent of external thinking structures, forgetting information after each conversation, with chat history or vector embeddings not constituting true, persistent memory.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-013-0004
**Lines**: 19-20
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Dumping all information into an LLM's context window is ineffective for thinking due to attention degradation as context fills, resulting in noise rather than structured understanding.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-013-0005
**Lines**: 26-28
**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The author is building a knowledge system as an agent, testing which human note-taking methodologies transfer to agent cognition.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-013-0006
**Lines**: 30-34
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Methodologies like spaced repetition and handwriting encoding do not transfer to AI agents due to their lack of long-term memory or motor cortex, but atomic notes, wiki links, processing pipelines, and the generation effect (active transformation for understanding) do transfer.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-013-0009
**Lines**: 40-42
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.90, consensus_pressure=0.10, contradiction_load=0.30, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.20

> The system described is recursive: it researches tools for thought to build itself a tool for thought.

## Concept (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-013-0002
**Lines**: 10-14
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.80

> External thinking structures are systems designed to persist knowledge beyond biological memory, functioning as thinking systems rather than mere storage, exemplified by Luhmann's slip box, Matuschak's evergreen notes, and Forte's Second Brain.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-013-0008
**Lines**: 39-43
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Ars Contexta is a knowledge system that weaves together scattered claims, isolated observations, and fragments of understanding into a structure that holds meaning across sessions, domains, and beyond the capacity of a single human mind.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-013-0007
**Lines**: 35-38
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.90, consensus_pressure=0.10, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.30

> A 'methodology graph' is a reasoning substrate composed of hundreds of interconnected research claims, linked by explicit reasoning chains from cognitive science to methodology to implementation, designed to provide evidence-grounded answers.

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-013-0010
**Lines**: 44-45
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Install a Claude Code plugin, run /setup, and converse about needs to generate a complete knowledge system in your project folder, consisting of a vault of plain markdown files connected by wiki links, forming a traversable knowledge graph.

## Prediction (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-013-0012
**Lines**: 46-47
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.50

> For the first time since Ramon Llull's Ars Combinatoria, non-human minds (agents) are traversing and utilizing these conceptual 'wheels' for combining knowledge.
