Google's new AI tools—Gemini 3, Google Disco, and Learn My Way—are replacing traditional online courses with deep, personalized learning experiences that adapt to each learner in real time. If you're still building static course content, you're competing against free AI that teaches better than pre-recorded videos ever could. This isn't coming—it's already here, and course creators who don't pivot to community-led transformation models will be obsolete by mid-2026.
