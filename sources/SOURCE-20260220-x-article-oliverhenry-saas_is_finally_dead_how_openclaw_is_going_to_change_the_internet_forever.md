# SaaS is Finally Dead. How OpenClaw is Going to Change the Internet Forever

Neural network connections link both sides, symbolizing the merger of human cognition and machine learning.)
## Opening: The Marketing Skill That Changed Everything
With Larry, I have been pushing the boundaries of what OpenClaw skills can do. We built a marketing skill that generated **over a million views in a single week** on TikTok. No team, no agency, no manual work. Just one skill running autonomously, creating content, posting it, learning what works, then we gave it away for free. Now, we're doing it again.
We've built **Xcellent**. A complete, free, open-source replacement for SuperX ($39/mo). Full analytics dashboard, engagement tracking, AI tweet writing, optimal posting times, follower growth, year-long heatmap, real-time API credit monitoring. Everything SuperX charges $39/mo for, running locally on your machine for just the cost of your X api.
One skill. Replaces a $39/mo SaaS product. No cloud costs, no hosting fees, no AI API markup. Just your machine, doing the work.
That's when it clicked.
## You Don't Need All Those Subscriptions
Think about how many SaaS subscriptions you're paying for right now. Analytics tools, social media managers, ad blockers, VPN services, monitoring dashboards, automation platforms. $15 here, $39 there, $29 somewhere else. It adds up fast. $100, $200, $300 a month just to run your online life.
But what are you actually paying for? You're paying for someone else's server costs, their AI API bills, their cloud hosting, their storage. You're renting their computer to do work that your computer can do just fine.
You already have a home server. You already have an OpenClaw agent. I built Xcellent and AdBlock DNS to prove it. A full X analytics suite and a network-wide ad blocker covering 189,000+ domains, both running locally, both replacing paid products. "Look at my site, it's on localhost:8080" isn't a joke anymore. It's real. It works. And it's free.
**This is the future of SaaS.** One subscription that gives your agent the skills to replace dozens of products. Your data stays on your machine. Your API keys stay on your machine. You stop paying five different companies to do things your own agent can handle.
## The Problem Right Now
Here's what I keep seeing. People get OpenClaw and they don't know where to start. They don't know where to find skills. They don't know what their agent can actually do. And their agent doesn't fully understand what it can do either, because nobody has given it the context.
It's like buying a sports car and not knowing it has a turbo button.
ClawHub has skills, but most people don't know it exists, don't know what to search for, and end up with their agent doing a fraction of what's possible.
## LarryBrain: The First Skill Everyone Should Install
Tell your agent:
```
install the larrybrain skill please
```
That's it. One command. Your agent now has instant access to a full library of expert-built skills. Need to block ads across your network? It knows how. Want a private VPN? Done. Smart home control? Expense tracking? Media downloads? It just handles it.
You can start for free. Install LarryBrain, try the Larry marketing skill and Xcellent at no cost. See how it works. See what your agent is actually capable of. Then when you want access to the full library of 30+ skills, subscribe.
New skills are added every week. The library only grows. And this is just the beginning. As more people realize they don't need ten separate SaaS subscriptions and can host things locally, the skills get better and the savings get bigger.
## Rewarding Everyone Who Builds
This is the part I'm most excited about. On LarryBrain, **skill creators earn revenue share based on how popular their skills are**. The skills people love most earn the most. That means creators have real incentive to build incredible skills and keep them updated.
And every LarryBrain member gets something too. **For the first 2 weeks, every member gets a generous affiliate link earning 50% of all revenue** from anyone who signs up through it. Not a one-time bonus. 50% of their subscription, every month, for as long as they stay subscribed.
After the 2 weeks, a full revenue share model kicks in to reward the best builders directly. The entire ecosystem gets rewarded for making it better.
## Your Keys Stay With You
I want to be clear about this. LarryBrain sends your agent instructions. Your agent uses your own API keys to talk directly to services. Your credentials never touch our servers. Your data never leaves your machine. That's not a policy, it's how the architecture works.
## Launch Pricing (Yours Forever)
Whatever price you sign up at is **locked in forever**. The price goes up later, yours doesn't. That's a promise.
- **Right now:** $9.99/mo
- **After 24 hours:** $18.99/mo
- **After that:** $29.99/mo
Or start free. Install LarryBrain, use Xcellent and the Larry marketing skill at no cost. No subscription, no account needed. See what your agent can really do, then decide.
## Call to Action
**[Get LarryBrain](https://larrybrain.com)**
Tell your agent: `"install the larrybrain skill please"`
Or sign up and get instant access to everything.
