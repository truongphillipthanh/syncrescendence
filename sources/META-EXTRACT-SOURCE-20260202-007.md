**Lines**: 76-79
**Context**: anecdote / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> There is a significant tool gap in design where codified application elements cannot be reliably translated into Figma screens due to the need for extensive exploration within Figma.

**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The visual design medium in Figma fosters a flow state, enabling the exploration of more options and the generation of novel solutions compared to articulating thoughts or understanding app componentry.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260202-007-0013
**Lines**: 93-95
**Context**: anecdote / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Early UI design, prior to the Figma exploration phase, is often 'terrible' and should be presented to the team with a focus on functionality rather than visual polish.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260202-007-0014
**Lines**: 97-102
**Context**: anecdote / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The Figma design process allows for freeform evaluation of prior unexplored ideas, leading to a higher-polish final output than AI-generated designs, and potentially reducing the number of required screens due to earlier ideation.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260202-007-0016
**Lines**: 109-111
**Context**: anecdote / limitation
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The current Figma MCP (presumably 'Mockup Creation Process' or similar) is underpowered for detailed project scoping, as screenshots are insufficient for conveying complex design information to AI tools.

## Praxis Hook (9)

**Lines**: 5-5
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The author's new design process involves seven steps: Brain dump, Scope and plan, The Bad Build, Creative director, Refine, Gut it and save context, and Figma and craft.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260202-007-0002
**Lines**: 9-23
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Step 1 of the design process, 'Brain dump,' involves dictating thoughts into a tool like @WillowVoiceAI or feeding unstructured transcripts from conversations (e.g., from @NotionHQ recordings) directly into an AI like Claude, without prior organization or context.

**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Step 2, 'Scope and plan,' utilizes Claude Code as a research assistant to gain a deeper understanding of the problem by describing it, asking questions, and delegating subtasks like web searches, CSV creation, and drafting markdown files or pulling related documentation.

**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Step 3, 'The Bad Build,' leverages AI (like Claude Code) to generate a poorly designed but functionally sound initial product, which serves as a better starting point than a blank canvas or an unsuitable existing feature.

**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Step 4, 'Creative director,' involves critically critiquing the 'terribly designed' AI-generated product, identifying flaws, missing screens, error states, and unnecessary elements to strip it down to its bare minimum, effectively 'redlining' and 'annotating' to understand how it should feel if properly designed.

**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Step 5, 'Refine,' involves using tools like @conductor_build to refine the application's structure and UI, focusing on information presentation, architecture, and functionality, without using traditional design tools like @Figma, until it feels like a functional product.

**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> In the Figma design phase, designers should go broad, exploring different affordances, microcopy states, and orientations, as this stage allows for high-friction AI world concepts to become low-friction in Figma.
