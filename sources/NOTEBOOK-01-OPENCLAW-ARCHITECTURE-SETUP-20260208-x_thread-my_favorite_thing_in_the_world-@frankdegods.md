My favorite thing in the world to play with now. You can accurately research anything on X now.

X just revamped their API to finally be useful

So I made a skill that searches X, modeled exactly like the native Claude Code research agent

I've been asking like "find best clawdbot skills last 24hrs" or "what are people saying about [ticker] today?"

(Description: GitHub repository card showing "x-research-skill" - X/Twitter research skill for Claude Code and OpenClaw. Agentic search, thread following, deep-dives, sourced briefings. 78 stars, 9 forks)

fixed, good notes!

(Description: Code snippet in green highlight box containing release notes)

**Done. Both fixed and pushed (v2.2.2):**

1. **Tweet truncation** — `tweet` and `thread` commands now show full text. Search results still truncate at 200 chars for readability.
2. **Bearer token security** — added a Security section to README documenting the exposure risk in agent session logs + recommendations. Credited @sergeykarayev in the commit. Good community catch — the fact that users are filing bugs via replies to your tweet is pretty cool.
