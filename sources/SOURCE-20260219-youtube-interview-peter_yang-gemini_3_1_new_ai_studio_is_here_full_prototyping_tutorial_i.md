## Description (no transcript available)

Google just dropped Gemini 3.1 and updated AI Studio to be full stack. Together, I think they make the best free AI prototyping and vibe coding tool in the market.

I’ve been prototyping with AI Studio for 6 months now and it’s completely changed how I build products at work. Instead of starting with specs and designs, I now start with prototypes that I can validate with stakeholders and real users in hours. Watch this tutorial to see how I prototype new features with AI Studio in 5 steps.

(01:33) What Google AI Studio can build (poker, image gen, games)
(03:08) Step 1: Build a base template for your existing product
(05:43) Step 2: Work with your AI design partner to add a new feature
(10:32) Step 3: Iterate with AI to refine your feature
(13:08) Step 4: Collaborate with others on the prototype
(15:05) Step 5: Turn your prototype into a real product
(16:12) Recap: How to master AI prototyping
