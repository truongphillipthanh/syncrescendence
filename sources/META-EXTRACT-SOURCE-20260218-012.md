## Claim (5)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260218-012-0001
**Lines**: 7-8
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Each frontier model currently has a lifespan of approximately two months at the technological frontier.

**Lines**: 8-10
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.80

> A frontier model costing $1B for research and training and $1B for inference can generate over $4B in revenues while it remains at the frontier, resulting in a net profit exceeding $2B.

**Lines**: 24-26
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.90

> The AI industry is currently in a state of market concentration with a few dominant players in frontier AI, largely due to the order of magnitude cost increase in model training and commensurate improvement in capabilities.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260218-012-0007
**Lines**: 28-29
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The post-scaling era for AI labs will likely maintain a large barrier to entry due to massive upfront capital requirements, similar to cloud providers.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260218-012-0008
**Lines**: 29-29
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Top AI models may be much more differentiated than largely undifferentiated cloud providers, as evidenced by variations in strengths and personalities observed in Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini over the past 6-8 months.

## Prediction (3)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260218-012-0003
**Lines**: 13-15
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.90

> Exponential increases in frontier AI training costs cannot continue indefinitely due to real-world capacity constraints and diminishing returns on capability improvements.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260218-012-0004
**Lines**: 15-17
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.60

> An "equilibrium" state will eventually be reached in frontier AI development where training costs diminish, and improvements are driven more efficiently by algorithmic advances.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260218-012-0006
**Lines**: 26-27
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.70

> AI labs will resemble cloud providers from a business perspective in the post-scaling era.
