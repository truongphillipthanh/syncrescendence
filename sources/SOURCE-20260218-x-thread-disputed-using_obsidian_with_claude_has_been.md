using Obsidian with Claude has been such a nice way to keep things organized, maintain better persistent memory/patterns, visualize system architectures using canvas files and more. build /skills that work directly inline.
no other note or file management system comes close.
(Description: A screenshot showing Obsidian interface with system architecture diagram. The image contains nested windows showing: Store Architecture (with components like "Artifacts, Assets, Stores, Actions, Interfaces"), Nodes Types (describing grid quality, visibility preferences, and transformations), and Interactive Features (including buttons, searches, and grid options). A colorful map visualization is visible at the bottom.)

you can also create/toggle different css snippets and customize layouts to change obsidian's appearance.
creative jungle gym to play around with. make spaces for you
(Description: A dark-themed Obsidian interface showing a folder structure on the left with numbered ranges (10-19 PROJECTS, 20-29 WRITING, 30-39 KNOWLEDGE, 40-49 TRACKING, 50-59 SYSTEM, 10-19 PROJECTS, 20-29 WRITING, 30-39 KNOWLEDGE, 40-49 TRACKING) displayed in green text. On the right side, code snippets and configuration panels are visible with similar numbered sections and metadata.)

claude handles it all. obsidian's framework is kinda the perfect tool for claude to read n write from, mark down/plain text structures, local storage, well documented, etc.
just ask claude to help get you structured in obsidian from the ground up, adjust n fine tune to your

yea ive used notion for years in a more corporate setting since the big benefit of it is the cloud-sharing aspect, working with groups of teams simultaneously.
But if for personal and localized use, Obsidian has it beat pretty heavily.

mix of both i guess. it builds out a better database of records and visualizations which in return acts as better memory. it's tough to gauge how much this help or is redundant compared to haked in memory structures, but at least it gives me a better visualization of records.
---
yep, makes the entire canvas file from scratch and will link it to whatever ongoing project folder/file within obsidian. nice feedback tool for itself as well
---
yea manual skill for when i would like to update/add specific project notes or diagrams.
could have a hook that auto-runs the skill after each session but sometimes you don't need to record everything
---
regular context, no MCPs required

here's the structure of the json thats holding artwork info, just what i find important to keep track of
```json
{
  "artistNames": "Jo",
  "platform": "Feral",
  "process": "Proced",
  "medium": "Image",
  "crypto": "ETH",
  "editionType": "1/",
  "editionNumber": "",
  "tags": [
    "plotter"
  ],
  "thumb": "https://",
  "renderUrl": "http",
  "link": "https://o",
  "contract": "0xacd",
  "tokenId": "189547",
  "aspectRatio": "Sc"
}

only dataview for home dashboard and excalidraw for doodling
any other features are built/embedded directly into my setup with the help of claude or css snippets
---
thats why i have a connected drawing tablet and excalidraw. have a pen and canvas im constantly doodling and writing to that can be then organized. better system than my previous of messy stack of notebooks, sketch paper and sticky pads.

hey david, shared somewhat of a starter guide for people to try it out if interested. structures meant to be flexible to adjust to your own ideas
if anyone's interested in trying Obsidian out, i've put together a skeleton framework of the file structure im using including a basic /obsidian skill for Claude that helps keep notes updated.
feel free to adapt structures to your preferences!...
