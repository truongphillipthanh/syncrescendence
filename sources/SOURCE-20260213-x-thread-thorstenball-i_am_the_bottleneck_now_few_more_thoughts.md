# "I am the bottleneck now" - Few more thoughts

## Post 1
**"I am the bottleneck now"**
**Few more thoughts**
(Description: Video showing a person wearing glasses in an office setting with a stack of books on a shelf behind them. The person appears to be speaking, with text overlay reading "ALL RIGHT, SO A". The video is 3:39 in duration.)

I now honestly think that most engineers who still think that agents will be plopped into existing software development loops - tickets, push to GitHub, run CI, review a PR, merge a PR - aren't thinking far enough ahead.

**Follow-up to follow-up:**
My intention was NOT to say "let's just pipe ALL things from Slack to the product and push to main".
What I meant to say was: it *is* possible with these very good models to often ship things without even reviewing the code, it's strange how the humans have turned into copy&pasters between agents, the models will get better and that means you need less and less reviews and ultimately you only will need to decide What gets built and When and whether you like the end result or not.
And my main point is: in *that* future, it seems insane to think that people will manage backlogs of ideas in ticketing and SDLC systems built for the past.

## Post 4
I guess that's true, yeah. So... Maybe I'm now a smaller bottleneck in a bigger bottle?
---
## Post 5
Yes. I never meant to say "I'll take myself fully out of the loop", see here: [link to previous post]
What I meant to say was: the tools we have right now assume humans are a much wider/longer bottleneck, but we're moving towards a future where you can trust models to get things
And Linear/GitHub/... don't look like they're built for this future.

I'd say that in the last 12 months I've spent more tokens than 99.99% of software engineers worldwide. I haven't had only a single amazing experience. Your problem is that you don't know what my job is.
---
## Post 7
You nailed it, yeah
---
## Post 8
I think you do that 10 times without the agent making any mistakes and then you notice "oh"
---
## Post 9
I'm not missing that. I'm talking about a very tricky but simple to fix bug. Product features I don't pipe from Slack to code.
But my point is not "this is how we should do it", but that the existing tools aren't made for the new world

## Post 10
I think the whole industry needs to come to understand that we need proper apprenticeships in which people learn and do things purely to learn, even if an AI could do the same thing.

## Post 11
Spot on!

## Post 12
I'm not glossing over anything. I've worked with agents for a long time now. I've used 5.3 for a week now, intensively, and I think the "make tons of mistakes" era is over.

## Post 13
lol

## Post 14
Oh really? Tell me more!
---
## Post 15
Yep, there will be human decision and taste and product shaping in there. But — and this is all I'm saying — everything around us will change to accommodate for that. I don't think we'll assign fucking GitHub tickets to agents in 2027.

## Post 16
I'd say if I'm the bottleneck I'm less replaceable than the things on either side of me, eh?
---
## Post 17
I'm not saying version control will be eliminated. I'm saying that the current form of it will change dramatically.
---
## Post 18
Yes
---
## Post 19
Watch until the end

## Post 20
Sure, you will need to decide inputs and outputs. But my point is: you don't need linear and github and all that stuff for it.
