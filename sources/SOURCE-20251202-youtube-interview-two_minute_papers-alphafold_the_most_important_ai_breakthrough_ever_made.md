## Description (no transcript available)

To celebrate the 5th anniversary of #AlphaFold, I was invited by Google DeepMind to interview Nobel Prize Winner and Distinguished Scientist, John Jumper. Note that we have no business ties with them.

Thank you so much to John for being so kind and insightful, and to the film crew as well - they all did an incredible job.
