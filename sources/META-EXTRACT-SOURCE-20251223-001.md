**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> For enterprise embedding, AI components like skills, Agent SDK, storage, and memory need to be available on all three major cloud providers.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251223-001-0012
**Lines**: 45-46
**Context**: consensus / limitation
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.80

> AI is not yet capable of full onboarding, understanding organizational dynamics, or autonomously picking up work.

## Concept (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251223-001-0005
**Lines**: 21-21
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Anthropic's core bet for Claude Code was to allow the model to "cook longer" and operate over fuzzier task definitions.

**Lines**: 35-37
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.50

> "Distributability" is a term coined by Anthropic for componentizing intelligence to enable enterprise deployment, meeting organizations where they are (e.g., AWS, specific setups, regulatory constraints).

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251223-001-0003

**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.60

> AI adoption can be categorized into three worlds: software engineers (clear productivity gains), non-engineers building software (democratizing creation), and enterprises (moving slowly, similar to mid-2010s cloud migration).

## Praxis Hook (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251223-001-0011
**Lines**: 44-44
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Delegating tasks to AI, similar to delegating to a colleague, requires providing context, setting clear expectations, and offering good examples.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251223-001-0013
**Lines**: 47-47
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Near-term AI delegation should focus on clean task chunks with clear success criteria.

## Prediction (3)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251223-001-0001
**Lines**: 4-5
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.40

> 2026 will be defined by AI reliably taking work off users' plates, moving beyond surface-level chatbots to comprehensive business process redesign.

**Lines**: 28-32
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.40

> In 2026, enterprise AI will focus on data annotation and lineage work to make data "AI-friendly," MCP adoption for internal services, moving from retrieval to action-taking, and human-in-the-loop decision queuing.
