What's really happening when AI enables active systems instead of passive storage? The common story is second brains are just better note-taking — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on building an AI second brain with Slack, Notion, Zapier, and Claude or ChatGPT:
- Why traditional storage systems fail for 19 out of 20 people
- How AI loops classify, route, and surface information automatically
- What eight building blocks make second brain systems actually work
- Where engineering principles translate into no-code automation for non-engineers

23:52 - Principle 8: Prefer Routing Over Organizing 
24:32 - Principle 9: Keep Categories Painfully Small 
25:29 - Principle 10: Design for Restart, Not Perfection 
26:08 - Principle 11: Build Core Loop, Then Add Modules 
26:38 - Principle 12: Optimize for Maintainability Over Cleverness 
27:12 - Step-by-Step Setup Guide Walkthrough 
29:35 - What It Feels Like When It's Working

For the first time in human history, you can build systems that work while you sleep — classifying thoughts, closing open loops, and nudging you toward what matters without requiring engineering skills.
