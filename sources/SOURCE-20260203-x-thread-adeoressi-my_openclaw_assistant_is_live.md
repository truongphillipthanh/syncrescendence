# OpenClaw Assistant Thread

**Adeo Ressi** (@adeoressi) · Feb 3, 2026

🤖 **My OpenClaw Assistant is live and crushing it!**

**Primary Model**
+ Kimi K2.5 (256k context + vision) - the price-to-performance ratio is absurd

**Fallbacks**
+ Claude Opus 4.5 - for when you need the big brain
+ GPT-5.2 - solid backup option

**Channels**
+ Telegram + WhatsApp - she finds me wherever I hide

**Full Google Workspace Access**
+ Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Contacts - reads, writes, schedules like a pro

**Browser Automation**
+ Web browsing, app logins, workflows on autopilot - set it and forget it

**Hardware**
+ Mac Mini running 24/7 - the little engine that could

**Memory**
+ qmd-skill
+ supermemory

**Bonus**
+ Built its own voice model - I literally talk to am Assistant on calls now. Mind-blowing.
+ Built its own LinkedIn API - It can help me manage the insanity of LinkedIn.

**The Real Magic**
+ Heartbeat check-ins every 30 min during work hours - scans email, Slack, tasks, nudges me to stay focused and crush priorities

**Quick Tips for OpenClaw Newbies**
+ Start with Kimi - saves insane money and handles multithreaded agentic tasks like a champ
+ Install memory skills - qmd-skill + supermemory makes it 10x smarter and prevents context loss
+ Add guardrails early - "Don't email anyone without my explicit approval" saves headaches
+ Expect mistakes - it will do dumb stuff sometimes, just like we all do, so iterate
+ Audit new skills - have it review before installing and keep everything updated regularly
