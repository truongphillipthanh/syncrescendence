## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260109-539-0002
**Lines**: 9-14
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The distinction between 'AI Augmentation' (AI helping humans do more) and 'AI Replacement' (AI entirely taking over execution roles) is crucial for understanding the future impact of AI.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260109-539-0004
**Lines**: 20-22
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.50

> A 'War Plan' for the AI transition includes the 'Runway Doctrine' and differentiates between 'Deep Craft' and 'Logistics'.

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260109-539-0003
**Lines**: 16-18
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.50

> To prepare for the shift to AI Replacement, individuals should focus on becoming a 'Navigator' rather than a 'Driver' within the next 18 months.

## Prediction (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260109-539-0001
**Lines**: 9-14
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.90, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.40

> The current period of 'AI Augmentation' is ending, and by early 2027, AI will transition to 'AI Replacement,' causing an exponential increase in its impact and leading to the complete replacement of execution roles.
