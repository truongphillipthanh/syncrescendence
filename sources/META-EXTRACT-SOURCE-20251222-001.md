## Claim (8)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251222-001-0001
**Lines**: 4-6
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Deep learning is currently in its "alchemy phase" and requires category theory to transition into a systematic science.

**Lines**: 6-8
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.80

> LLMs fundamentally cannot perform addition reliably because they learn patterns that work most of the time but fail when computational structure matters.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251222-001-0004
**Lines**: 16-19
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Language models cannot reliably perform addition; they fail when a single digit change in a problem requires actual understanding of computation rather than pattern matching.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251222-001-0005
**Lines**: 23-25
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.80

> There is a significant misalignment between the training of frontier models (hundreds of billions of multiplications for one token) and their inability to reliably multiply small numbers.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251222-001-0006
**Lines**: 28-30
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Deep learning currently lacks a unifying theory to systematically design architectures for specific tasks, despite achieving powerful results.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251222-001-0009
**Lines**: 36-37
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The synthetic approach to mathematics, focusing on behavior and relations, is the correct level of abstraction for designing neural networks.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251222-001-0010
**Lines**: 40-41
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The mathematical notion of a 'carry' has been overlooked in the design of graph neural networks.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251222-001-0011
**Lines**: 41-41
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Carry operations are fundamentally at odds with how traditional GNNs work, where the entire state is sent between nodes, because carry information resides in the change of state, not the state itself.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251222-001-0008
**Lines**: 34-36
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Synthetic mathematics defines entities by their behavior and relationships (e.g., a vector by what can be done with it), rather than by their constituent parts (e.g., a tuple of numbers).

## Framework (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251222-001-0003
**Lines**: 8-11
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Categorical deep learning is proposed as a bridge between constraints and implementation in neural networks, recovering geometric deep learning as a special case and naturally expressing recursion, weight tying, and non-invertible computation.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251222-001-0007
**Lines**: 30-31
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Category theory offers a systematic, "Lego-like approach" for building neural architectures.
