## Description (no transcript available)

Every Google Gemini 3.0 Pro Feature You'll NEED in 2026

In this video, I walk through every major capability of Gemini 3.0 Pro and Google’s AI stack in real use. You’ll see how it reasons through complex problems, analyzes images and videos, handles massive PDFs with long context, powers AI mode in Google Search, and connects with tools like Nano Banana Pro, Veo 3.1, and NotebookLM to create images, videos, podcasts, and full workflows from scratch.

If you’re still using Gemini like a basic chatbot, you’re wasting time. This is how to use it properly.

I'm Parker. I started this YouTube Channel with the goal to learn more about AI myself and to then pass on the knowledge to anyone willing to listen.
