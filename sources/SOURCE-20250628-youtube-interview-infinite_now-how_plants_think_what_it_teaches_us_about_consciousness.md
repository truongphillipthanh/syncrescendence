# How Plants Think & What It Teaches us about Consciousness

## Description (no transcript available)

What is plant intelligence? What is thought without a brain? Although many will react strongly against the notion of plant consciousness, it does nonetheless remain a profound field of academic enquiry. From Mimosa to mycelial networks, we explore how plants and mushrooms challenge our understanding of thought, intelligence, consciousness and even free will. From biology to philosophy, we ask if intelligence is truly confined to neurons, or something far more ancient, abstract and expansive.

This is a chapter in a wider metaphysical journey—one that invites you to look again at the world around you, to see the unseen.
