## Analogy (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-006-0003
**Lines**: 19-28
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.80

> The 'Hammer Problem' illustrates that individuals with only one mental model (like a hammer) tend to force every problem (nail) to fit that model, distorting reality to match what they already know.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-006-0009
**Lines**: 55-57
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Munger views the economy as an ecosystem, similar to how animals flourish by finding niches, businesses can flourish by specializing and excelling in specific areas.

## Claim (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-006-0001
**Lines**: 4-4
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Most people approach decision-making incorrectly by believing that accumulating more information reduces uncertainty, whereas 80 unrelated Mental Models are more effective.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-006-0005
**Lines**: 34-35
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Munger suggests that 80-90 mental models are sufficient for 90% of situations, with a few models performing the majority of the work.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-006-0002
**Lines**: 14-15
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Charlie Munger's 'Mental Models' are a fundamental thinking framework, not a productivity hack or investment trick, applicable to all decisions.

## Framework (3)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-006-0004
**Lines**: 31-32
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.80

> A 'latticework of mental models' involves integrating big ideas from multiple disciplines to create a reinforcing thinking framework.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-006-0007
**Lines**: 48-51
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Key engineering mental models include: backup systems (critical processes need redundancy), breakpoints (systems change behavior dramatically after a threshold), and critical mass (the point at which something becomes self-sustaining).

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-006-0008
**Lines**: 52-55
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Munger's system for thinking involves treating the mind as an operating system and installing 80 to 90 'applications' (mental models) from diverse fields like math, engineering, biology, psychology, and microeconomics, forming a 'latticework' of knowledge.

## Praxis Hook (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-006-0006
**Lines**: 42-44
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.70

> To make critical decisions, one must override natural intuition and force oneself to estimate actual probabilities and expected values using numbers (payoff, cost).

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260219-006-0010
**Lines**: 59-66
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.70

> To acquire mental models, one should read widely across disciplines, focusing on learning the big ideas (80-90 core concepts) rather than mastering details, and repeatedly use these models in everyday life.
