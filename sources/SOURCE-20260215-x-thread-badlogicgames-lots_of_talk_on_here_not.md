aliases: ["badlogicgames - critique of agent innovation stagnation"]
synopsis: "A sharp critique arguing that despite all the agent hype, there has been little genuine innovation since the original Claude Code. Calls out multi-agent UIs, git-stuffed sessions, and token-obsessed builders as recycled ideas that don't solve fundamental agent problems like the 'lethal trifecta.'"
key_insights:
  - "The lethal trifecta for general agents may be fundamentally undecidable - all solutions are papering over the core issue"
  - "Stuffing agent sessions into git creates logs nobody reads, just like nobody reads the code agents write"
  - "Most 'innovation' is repackaging May 2025 ideas - genuine product breakthroughs from agents remain scarce"

# Mario Zechner Thread: "Lots of talk on here, not a lot of innovation"
lots of talk on here, not a lot of innovation (that includes my work). models have improved, but everything around them is basically a play on the original CC.
if agents make experimentation in software so feasible, then why don't we see that materialize in products?
---
closing the feedback loop is one way to make agents a little bit more autonomous. zero innovation in that space.
sourcing task from something other than a ticket system is also not innovation. congrats, you just fucked your log of decision making.

building a ui to manage multiple agents at once? that's may 2025, e.g. vibetunnel, or the two dozen other things that did exactly that. turns out it's not the unlock you think it is.
putting an agent in a multi-user chat? awesome for fun times and personal one-off automations, doesn't solve the fundamental issues of how to use agents to create software.
---
stuffing your agent session into git along with the changeset? you are already not reading any of the code. you won't be reading any of the session logs either.
the list goes on. turns out clankers can't replace some meatbag having novel ideas.
---
biggest unlock for general agent use would be solving for the lethal trifecta. but that turns out to be from the set of undecideable problems for general agents. anything we do is papering over the fundamental issue.
no, stuffing your agent into a container is not it, chief.

everyone i follow on here that paddles "tokens tokens tokens" either publishes absolutely broken garbage software they themselves haven't used for anything other than building garbage, or blog posts that are inactionable.
it's fucking hilarious.
---
i used to find interesting tech stuff on here to learn from.
i haven't learned shit in the past year. it's like i've joined a philosophers club of builders who never held a shovel in their hands.
---
if you post breathless blog posts with inactionable advise and about how we are all ngmi, while it takes you weeks to fix trivial bugs and implement simple features, i can't take you seriously.
slowly turning into dax. wtf

@banteg is the fucking goat

personal software is also a product.

we must have different timelines. would also like to point out that i produce stuff free for use, and reserve my right to voice my opinion on this shit platform :)
