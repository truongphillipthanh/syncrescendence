# Five New Paradigms of Intelligence

## Executive Summary

Blaise Aguera y Arcas presents a tight philosophical case: the brain is computational, computation is substrate-independent (multiple realizability), intelligence is fundamentally prediction, consciousness is self-modeling, and intelligence is social. LLMs evidence intelligence because they are predictors—validating cybernetic theory from 1943. The social intelligence hypothesis explains why we're seeing an intelligence explosion now: more intelligent entities = more complex predictors in feedback loops.

## Key Insights

### The Brain Is Computational
Hodgkin-Huxley equations demonstrate that everything in the brain is amenable to mathematical modeling. The brain isn't a "traditional computer" (no CPU, hard drives) but is absolutely computational. By Church-Turing thesis, its computations can run on any computer.

### Multiple Realizability
Computation doesn't care about substrate. The same computation can be performed by human computers, UNIVAC, or brain tissue. "It doesn't matter how you compute something."

### Turing Test Correctly Understood
The Turing test is often misunderstood. Turing's foundational thesis: "a thing is defined by its function, not by the mechanism through which it performs that function. If something does consciousness, it is conscious." When Lambda was asked if it was a philosophical zombie, it correctly noted: "You can't prove you're not a philosophical zombie either."

### Intelligence Is Prediction (Cybernetic Foundation)
Wiener (1943) decomposed behavior: active/non-active, purposeful/non-purposeful, feedback-based/non-feedback-based, predictive/non-predictive. A teleological system is fundamentally a predictor; higher-order prediction = more intelligence. Even a bacterium must predict its own future existence to survive—"that's evolution."

### Consciousness as Self-Modeling
"What your mind models is other minds. When your mind models itself, that's what consciousness is." The social intelligence hypothesis: intelligence explosions occur through feedback loops with other intelligent beings. AI is adding more intelligent entities to this loop, accelerating the explosion.

## Quotable Passages

> "The brain isn't a traditional computer—no CPU, no hard drives. But it absolutely is computational. And that means its computations can be run on any computer by definition." — Blaise Aguera y Arcas

> "A thing is defined by its function, not by the mechanism through which it performs that function. If something does consciousness, it is conscious." — Blaise Aguera y Arcas on Turing

> "What your mind models is other minds. When your mind models itself, that's what consciousness is." — Blaise Aguera y Arcas

> "Their central claim was that a teleological or purposive system is fundamentally a predictor, and the higher the order of prediction, the more intelligent the system is." — on Wiener et al. 1943
