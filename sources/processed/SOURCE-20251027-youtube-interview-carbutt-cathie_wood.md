# Cathie Wood: Productivity-Driven Economic Boom Thesis

## Core Thesis
The US is transitioning from a three-year rolling recession into a productivity-driven recovery, catalyzed by tax policy changes (effective corporate tax dropping to 10-12%) and broad deregulation. This mirrors but could exceed the Reaganomics boom of the 80s/90s.

## Key Insights

### Economic Diagnosis
- Manufacturing negative for 3 years
- Small businesses and low/middle income consumers suffering
- Capital spending flat/declining outside AI and power

### Policy Catalysts (OB3 - July 4th Bill)
- Statutory rate remains 21%
- Effective corporate tax: ~10-12% (lowest among major economies)
- Key mechanism: Accelerated depreciation for manufacturing, equipment, R&D, software
- Deregulation mandate across healthcare, crypto, AI

### Market Predictions
**Dollar Strength (contrarian view):**
- Returns on invested capital rising relative to rest of world
- Foreign direct investment expected to increase
- Parallels to Reaganomics dollar doubling (1985)

**Gold vs Dollar:**
- If dollar becomes "as good as gold" (Art Laffer framing), gold loses appeal
- Precedent: Gold dropped $800→$300 in early 80s dollar rally

**Bitcoin Positioning:**
- "Digital gold" + first-of-kind new asset class
- Institutions just beginning to enter
- Technology component distinguishes from pure store-of-value

### Employment Nuance
- Employment is lagging indicator
- Expect more negative employment news near-term
- AI limiting opportunities especially for new graduates
- Productivity gains may not translate to job creation immediately

## Canonical Relevance
- Supports CANON-33112 Revenue Model macro environment analysis
- Informs Expertise chain market positioning
- Bitcoin thesis aligns with Information chain crypto perspective
