## Concept (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251208-895-0002
**Lines**: 14-16
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Context engineering is an emerging discipline that treats context as a first-class system with its own architecture, lifecycle, and constraints, aiming to build reliable, efficient, and debuggable production-grade agents.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251208-895-0004
**Lines**: 24-26
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.50

> An agent can be theoretically defined as a Markovian probability chain, with mathematically optimizable "Degrees of Freedom" primarily being the Inference Functional and the State Update function.

## Framework (3)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251208-895-0001
**Lines**: 10-12
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Google Cloud's "Mathematical Framing for Different Agent Strategies" proposes a unified probabilistic formulation to quantify agent behavior, moving beyond empirical benchmarks.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251208-895-0003
**Lines**: 20-22
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source, multi-agent-native framework designed to enable active context engineering in real systems, based on Google's experience scaling complex agentic systems.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251208-895-0005
**Lines**: 28-31
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Multi-Agent collaboration is formalized not as a communication protocol, but as an integral over the context space, incorporating a cost-regularized objective function to balance probability maximization against computational latency.

## Praxis Hook (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251208-895-0006
**Lines**: 34-36
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The ADK's thesis of "Context as a Compiled View" serves as the practical implementation of the mathematical State Update function described in Google's theoretical framing.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251208-895-0007
**Lines**: 37-41
**Context**: method / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.70

> ADK's modular "Processors" and "Flows" enable the deterministic compilation of raw "Session" storage into ephemeral "Working Context," which minimizes signal degradation and operationalizes the theoretical search for high-probability manifolds in production environments.
