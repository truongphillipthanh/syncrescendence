Instead, give them a tool, the use of which will lead to new ways of thinking,' illustrates the current shift in creative industries from 'who knows more' to 'who built something useful with what they know.'

**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.60

**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.60

**Lines**: 88-93
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Traditional creatives (designers, illustrators, art directors, filmmakers) transitioning to AI-augmented work have an immediate advantage due to their existing craft sensibility and understanding of composition, color, hierarchy, and narrative.

**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Even at the 'Creator' stage, value generation is linear, meaning one unit of effort produces one unit of output, and the work requires direct attention, ceasing to flow when production stops.

> The jump from 'Creator' to 'Compounder' is difficult for most creatives because it requires a shift from asking 'What can I make?' to 'What can I make that makes other people better at making things?', challenging the traditional model where value resides in execution.
