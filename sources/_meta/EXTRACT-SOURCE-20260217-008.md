## Claim (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260217-008-0002
**Lines**: 20-28
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.50

> In a compute-constrained world with a small number of AI firms, profit arises because competition among these firms, even with differentiated models and high gross profit margins on inference, does not equilibrate to perfect competition with zero margins, but rather to a Cournot equilibrium.

## Concept (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260217-008-0001
**Lines**: 10-13
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.90

> The Cournot equilibrium describes a market state where a small number of firms (oligopoly) compete on supply rather than price, predicting competitors' actions and responding accordingly, leading to non-zero profit margins.

**Lines**: 31-32
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.90, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.90

> John Nash generalized the Cournot model in 1950 with the concept of the Nash equilibrium, which applies to a broader range of strategic interactions.
