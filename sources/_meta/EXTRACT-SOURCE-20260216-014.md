## Claim (9)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-014-0001
**Lines**: 4-7
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.90, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.80

> In the past few weeks, nearly $1 trillion was wiped from software and services stocks, with major players like FactSet, S&P Global, and Thomson Reuters experiencing significant market cap reductions.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-014-0002
**Lines**: 15-17
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.50

> LLMs are systematically dismantling the moats that made vertical software defensible, leading to a redrawing of what makes vertical software valuable and its deserved market multiple.

**Lines**: 25-28
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.90, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.80

> A defining characteristic of vertical software companies is their high pricing (e.g., FactSet at $15,000+ per user/year, Bloomberg Terminal at $25,000 per seat) and high customer retention rates (around 95%).

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-014-0007

**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The investment in learning a proprietary software interface is not transferable, creating high switching costs and user loyalty, as evidenced by statements like 'We're a FactSet shop' or 'We're a Bloomberg house'.

**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Business logic is migrating from code written by specialized engineers to markdown files that anyone with domain expertise can write.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-014-0010
**Lines**: 51-53
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The accumulated business logic that took vertical software companies a decade to build can now be replicated in weeks, eroding the workflow moat very fast.

**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.80

> A massive portion of vertical software's value proposition was making hard-to-access data easy to query.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-014-0012
**Lines**: 62-66
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Before LLMs, accessing public data like SEC filings required specialized software and significant engineering scaffolding, such as thousands of parsers maintained by armies of engineers.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-014-0013
**Lines**: 66-67
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.80

> The code to turn a raw SEC filing into queryable data was a genuine competitive advantage.

## Concept (2)

**Lines**: 22-24
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.90, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.90

> Vertical software is software built for a specific industry, exemplified by platforms like Bloomberg for finance, LexisNexis for legal, and Epic for healthcare.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-014-0006
**Lines**: 33-37
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Learned Interfaces, characterized by users spending years mastering keyboard shortcuts, function codes, and navigation patterns (e.g., Bloomberg Terminal's GP, FLDS, GIP, FA, BQ), constituted a significant, under-appreciated moat for vertical software.

> At Fintool, a portfolio manager can encode their entire methodology for discounted cash flow (DCF) valuations into a markdown file, including data gathering, WACC calculation by industry, assumption validation, sensitivity analysis, and stock-based compensation adjustments, without writing any code.
