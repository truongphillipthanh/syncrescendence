## Description (no transcript available)

MCP server tutorial → https://goo.gle/mcpserver 

This video, the second in our series, guides developers through building their own MCP server with Agent Development Kit (ADK). Watch along and learn about the core components needed, from the `mcp` library to server handlers, to make any ADK tool discoverable. We explore three distinct use cases: building a simple API MCP server, a database MCP server using the MCP Toolbox, and custom MCP servers for advanced scenarios. This helps transition isolated agents into a truly interconnected AI ecosystem.
