# Guide Tutorials: P1 - The Orchestration Workflow

Guide Tutorials : P1 - The Orchestration Workflow

6 terminals. 1 orchestrator. Parallel execution.

**From Shorthand:**
- Embedded skills in prompts
- Subagents
- Orchestration + Planning
- tmux

**From Longform:**
- Parallelization
- Groundwork
- Verification loops

(hidden easter egg)

(Description: Video screenshot showing a multi-monitor setup with six Claude Code terminal windows running in parallel. Each terminal displays code execution with orange status indicators at the top. Green progress bars are visible indicating active processes. The setup demonstrates tmux splitting of multiple terminals for parallel agent orchestration, with the orchestrator managing execution across all instances.)

> what's the difference between this and just asking claude to spawn 5 background tasks in parallel

thats literally what I did in the video its all background processes, except its visual as you can watch and edit / stop the output in individual background processes / you can interact with individual processes without the orchestration

more degrees of freedom this way
