# ClawdBot Use Cases Thread

I keep seeing this really stupid post: "I tried ClawdBot and there are NO good use cases"

Let's put this to rest

Then 7 most life changing ClawdBot use cases I've implemented (so far):

- **Overnight coder.** Every night Clawd builds 1 app using Claude Code that it thinks will improve your workflow based on your conversations

- **Based on every conversation you've ever had with your Clawd,** get a daily research report explaining 1 relevant topic spoken in the voice of a professor

- **Headless Notion.** No need to go through 100 folders to write or find notes. When you have something you want to remember, just text your Clawd and it will auto store and organize it for you

- **Personal CRM:** based on every email, text, or DM you have, create a database of your contacts and all your messages. Continuously update automatically. Take AI notes and create follow up tasks

- **Automatic assistant:** take a look at my todo list every day (I use Things 3) and see what tasks you can just do automatically for me

- **X trends follower:** connect to the Grok API and continuously monitor trends in your specific niche. When one presents an opportunity for an app, build it automatically

- **Content researcher:** Clawd looks at all your content channels, finds your direct competitors, then continuously monitors them, texting you directly when they post content that performs significantly better than normal

If you don't find any of these use cases life changing then you are using the internet wrong
