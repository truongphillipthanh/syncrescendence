Ever wish your AI tools could actually do the work — not just talk about it?

Most business leaders are stuck in the loop of experimenting with AI, but not seeing meaningful returns. The problem? Most tools aren’t practical, integrated, or business-focused. That changes today.

In this episode, Isar Metis walks you through a full hands-on demo of Claude Cowork — Anthropic’s latest update that quietly redefines AI in business. No jargon. No code. Just real results, from summarizing invoices to building full-blown applications on the fly.

You’ll see Claude Cowork in action across three real use cases, each one designed to save time, cut costs, and actually do the work your team is bogged down by.

In this session, you'll discover:
 - How Claude Cowork works (and why it's a game-changer for non-technical professionals)
 - The surprising capabilities hidden behind Claude Code
 - How to set up Claude Cowork on your Mac (with no dev team required)
 - A live walkthrough: automating invoice summaries into structured Excel files
 - Building a Mac application to manage business expenses — in under 3 minutes
 - Creating a branded PowerPoint presentation from podcast transcripts
 - The future of connected, agentic AI tools — and what it means for 2026
