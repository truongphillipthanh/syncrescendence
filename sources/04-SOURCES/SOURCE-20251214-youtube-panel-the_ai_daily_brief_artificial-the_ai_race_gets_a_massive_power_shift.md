## Description (no transcript available)

President Trump approved exports of Nvidia H200 GPUs to China with a negotiated 25% revenue cut, reversing prior US export controls. Analysts warn the move trades national-security and compute advantage for short-term economic gains, with models projecting China’s AI compute share could rise from about 2% to 12–30%. The decision sparked partisan fights over corruption claims, federal preemption of state AI rules, and far-reaching consequences for the US–China AI race and supply chains.
