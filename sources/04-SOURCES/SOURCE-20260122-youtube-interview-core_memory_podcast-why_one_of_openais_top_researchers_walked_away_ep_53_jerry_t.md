# Why One of OpenAI’s Top Researchers Walked Away - EP 53 Jerry Tworek

**Channel**: Core Memory Podcast

## Description (no transcript available)

We bring you an exit interview with Jerry Tworek, one of the most influential (and least public) figures behind the modern AI boom. Tworek recently left OpenAI after nearly seven years at the company, where he worked on or led some of its most important breakthroughs, including the shift toward reasoning-driven models. In a candid, wide-ranging conversation, Tworek reflects on OpenAI’s transformation from a 30-person research lab into a global AI powerhouse, what it’s like to build frontier models amid nonstop pressure, and why he ultimately decided it was time to walk away.

We dig into what Tworek thinks the entire AI industry is getting wrong, why nearly every major lab is now converging on the same ideas, and where the next real breakthroughs might come from. He talks openly about risk, research culture, reinforcement learning, architectural dead ends, AGI timelines, and the psychological toll of working at the center of the AI arms race.
