## Description (no transcript available)

We got Ryan Carson on the pod to break down the “Ralph Wiggum” Agent and why it’s suddenly everywhere. He walks me through a simple workflow that lets an autonomous agent build a full product feature while I sleep: start with a PRD, convert it into small user stories with tight acceptance criteria, then run a looped script that ships work in clean iterations. The big idea is you’re not “vibe coding” one giant prompt—you’re giving the agent testable, bite-sized tickets and letting it execute like an engineering team. By the end, Ryan shows how this becomes repeatable (and safer) with a memory layer—agents.md for long-term notes and progress.txt for iteration-to-iteration context.

Key Points

* I can’t expect “sleep-shipping” unless I translate the feature into small, testable user stories with clear acceptance criteria.
* Ralph works like a Kanban loop: pull one story, implement, commit, mark pass/fail, then grab the next.
* The real leverage is the reset: each iteration starts fresh with a clean context window, instead of one giant, messy thread.
* agents.md becomes long-term memory across the repo; progress.txt is short-term memory across iterations.
* The bottleneck isn’t “coding”—it’s the upfront spec quality: PRD clarity, atomic stories, and verifiable criteria.
