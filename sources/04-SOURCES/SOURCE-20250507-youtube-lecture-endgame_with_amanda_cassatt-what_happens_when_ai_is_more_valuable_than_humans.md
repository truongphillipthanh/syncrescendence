## Description (no transcript available)

You’re already obsolete (but there’s hope) with George Hotz

What happens when machines become more economically valuable than humans?

This episode dives into the real future of AI—not a sudden singularity, but a steady shift that’s redefining how we work, govern, and live. Amanda is joined by George Hotz to explore why humans still matter in an AI-driven world, how value creation—not credentials—will shape the future, and what happens when intellectual property, the U.S. dollar, and even our attention become obsolete.

Together, they challenge economic protectionism, advocate for high-skilled immigration, and explore emerging ideas like gold-backed digital currency and AI-enhanced hiring. From digital addiction to deregulation, this episode connects the dots between technology and the systems it’s disrupting.
