# We Watched a Brain Emerge..." The AI That Might Kill Transformers (w/ Pathway's Zuzanna Stamirowska)

## Description (no transcript available)

Imagine an AI that doesn’t just output answers — it remembers, adapts, and reasons over time like a living system. 

In this episode of The Neuron, Corey Noles and Grant Harvey sit down with Zuzanna Stamirowska, CEO & Cofounder of Pathway, to break down what's building: the world’s first post-Transformer frontier model, called BDH — the Dragon Hatchling architecture.

Zuzanna explains why current language models are stuck in a “Groundhog Day” loop — waking up with no memory — and how Pathway’s architecture introduces true temporal reasoning and continual learning. 

We explore:
• Why Transformers lack real memory and time awareness
• How BDH uses brain-like neurons, synapses, and emergent structure
• How models can “get bored,” adapt, and strengthen connections
• Why Pathway sees reasoning — not language — as the core of intelligence
• How BDH enables infinite context, live learning, and interpretability
• Why gluing two trained models together actually works in BDH
• The path to AGI through generalization, not scaling
• Real-world early adopters (Formula 1, NATO, French Postal Service)
• Safety, reversibility, checkpointing, and building predictable behavior
• Why this architecture could power the next era of scientific innovation

From brain-inspired message passing to emergent neural structures that literally appear during training, this is one of the most ambitious rethinks of AI architecture since Transformers themselves.

If you want a window into what comes after LLMs, this interview is essential.
