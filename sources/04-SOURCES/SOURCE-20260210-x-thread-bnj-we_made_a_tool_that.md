# Style Dropper Thread

**Post 1 — Feb 10, 2026, 1:10 PM**

We made a tool that lets you absorb the vibe of anything you point it at and apply it to your designs It's absurd and it just works Style Dropper, now available in @variantui

(Description: Embedded video showing Style Dropper in action. A UI design demonstrating the tool applying visual styles and vibe to design layouts with smooth animations and color transitions.)

We grew up on Kid Pix and MS Paint, and wanted to instill Style Dropper with that same sense of magic

(And yes, it really does look that cool in Variant)

(Description: Embedded video/design showcase displaying a grid of design variations with different color palettes, textures, and visual styles — including sunset tones, deep burgundy patterns, and beige striped textures applied to various design mockups.)
