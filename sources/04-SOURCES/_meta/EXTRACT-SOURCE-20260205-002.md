## Analogy (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-002-0007
**Lines**: 44-46
**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.50

> AI coding tools will follow the trajectory of 'media technology' like cameras (daguerreotype to iPhone): starting with low use, exploding in capabilities, then becoming a product for the average person.

## Claim (5)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-002-0001
**Lines**: 19-19
**Context**: rebuttal / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.80, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.40

> AI will not eat UI; instead, UI will become more important.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-002-0002
**Lines**: 23-23
**Context**: prediction / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.50

> AI coding for UI will be one of the most economically important ways people build things.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-002-0003
**Lines**: 25-26
**Context**: prediction / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Humans and agents will always be using UIs, and UIs will become more important for better computer use, interfaces for humans post-code, and maintaining legacy business software.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-002-0006
**Lines**: 39-40
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Models will become fast at UI tasks because code has verifiable rewards (tests pass, code runs), making it ideal for Reinforcement Learning (RL).

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-002-0008
**Lines**: 48-48
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.30

> Coding will progress orders of magnitude faster than cameras, potentially within 5-20 years.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-002-0010
**Lines**: 55-58
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.40

> There will only be two primary form factors for coding with UIs: low latency + low entropy (sub 100ms) where user intent translation is the bottleneck, and long background tasks (big refactors, maintenance, scaffolding features) where intelligence is the bottleneck.

## Prediction (3)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-002-0004
**Lines**: 32-32
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Most new UIs will be made using web technology.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-002-0005
**Lines**: 37-37
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Models will first become incredibly fast at UI tasks, then incredibly good.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-002-0009
**Lines**: 50-51
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Once AI coding becomes commodified, the winners will be those with better taste and ease of use, not those with only slightly better bleeding-edge capability.
