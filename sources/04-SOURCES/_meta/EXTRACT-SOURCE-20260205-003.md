## Analogy (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-003-0003
**Lines**: 17-20
**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The transformation of knowledge work by AI in 2026 will parallel the transformation of coding by AI in 2025, where 'vibe coding' (coined by @karpathy) allowed anyone to build software by describing their needs.

## Claim (4)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-003-0002
**Lines**: 10-13
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The launch of Claude Opus 4.6 marks a watershed moment for AI becoming a real working partner for people in industries like finance and consulting who use spreadsheets, slide decks, and long documents.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-003-0004
**Lines**: 24-25
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> On internal benchmarks for real-world finance tasks, Opus 4.6 improved by over 23% compared to Sonnet 4.5, which was considered state-of-the-art recently.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-003-0005
**Lines**: 26-28
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The performance improvements of Opus 4.6 are demonstrated in tasks like building financial models, creating pitch decks, and M&A analysis, which typically take an analyst weeks.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-003-0006
**Lines**: 30-31
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Opus 4.6 produces first-pass deliverables that are significantly better, often landing where previous models required multiple rounds of revision or couldn't achieve at all.

## Praxis Hook (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-003-0007
**Lines**: 34-35
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> To fully leverage AI model improvements, product integration is crucial, as seen with Claude Code which provided a user interface for applying coding advancements.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-003-0008
