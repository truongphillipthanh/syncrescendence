> In an AI-dominated software world, formal verification is essential, not optional, due to the persistence of unknown unknowns.

## Prediction (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-028-0001
**Lines**: 6-12
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.30

> When AI makes rewriting code and understanding large foreign codebases cheap, the incentive to rely on deep dependency trees will collapse, leading to a return of software monoliths.
