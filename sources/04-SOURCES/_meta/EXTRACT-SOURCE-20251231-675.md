## Claim (5)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251231-675-0001
**Lines**: 15-16
**Context**: rebuttal / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The common story that AI coding assistants only make developers faster is an oversimplification; the reality of front-end engineering in the age of AI is more complex.
