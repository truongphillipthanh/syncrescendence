## Analogy (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251226-712-0004
**Lines**: 17-20
**Context**: anecdote / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Fuentes' approach to physics, drawing on her background as a dancer, suggests that mastering classical forms (established physics) is necessary, but true novelty emerges by breaking those rules.

## Claim (3)

**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.90

> Ivette Fuentes is conducting research at the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravity.

**Lines**: 10-12
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.90, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.90

> Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) are ultra-cold states of matter where millions of atoms act as a single quantum system.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251226-712-0003
**Lines**: 12-15
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Bose–Einstein condensates are highly sensitive to gravitational effects, making them suitable for investigating gravity's role in quantum collapse, as proposed by Roger Penrose.

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251226-712-0005
**Lines**: 17-20
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> To achieve novelty in a field, one must first fully master its classical forms before daring to break its established rules.
