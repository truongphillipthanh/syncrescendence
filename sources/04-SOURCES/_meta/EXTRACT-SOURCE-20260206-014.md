## Analogy (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-014-0001
**Lines**: 7-10
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Graph traversal in digital note-taking systems, particularly through wikilinks, replicates the brain's process of spreading activation when priming related concepts, with activation decaying with distance from the starting node.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-014-0004
**Lines**: 22-24
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The function of descriptions as retrieval filters in note-taking systems is analogous to high-decay activation in cognitive science, where enough signal is received to assess relevance without reconstructing full content.

## Claim (3)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-014-0005
**Lines**: 26-30
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Backlinks in a note-taking system function as primes, revealing the practical meaning of a concept by showing contexts where it was previously useful, thereby extending its definition beyond the author's original intent and priming relevant neighborhoods.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-014-0007
**Lines**: 40-41
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Focused retrieval (answering specific questions) benefits from a high decay rate in note traversal, while exploratory synthesis (finding connections) benefits from a low decay rate to spread wider.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-014-0010
**Lines**: 55-55
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The architecture of agentic note-taking systems, developed for practical engineering problems like token efficiency and navigability, remarkably maps onto the biological brain's spreading activation model, including nodes, weighted edges, decay functions, priming, and threshold-based retrieval decisions.

## Concept (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-014-0002
**Lines**: 12-15
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Progressive disclosure in note-taking systems functions as a decay-based context loading mechanism, where each step (e.g., file tree, description, full content) loads more context at a higher cost, analogous to how activation decays in the brain.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-014-0003
**Lines**: 17-20
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Descriptions in a note-taking system are retrieval filters, not summaries; they provide lossy compression that preserves decision-relevant features to help users decide whether to read the full note, rather than compressing its entire content.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-014-0009
**Lines**: 50-53
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> A complete traversal architecture for agentic note-taking combines wikilinks for graph structure, spreading activation for loading mechanisms, and small-world topology for efficiency, with each element addressing a different aspect of agent cognition.

## Praxis Hook (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-014-0006
**Lines**: 34-38
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Traversal in agentic note-taking systems requires tuning parameters such as decay rate (how quickly activation fades per hop), threshold (minimum activation to follow a link), and max depth (hard limit on traversal distance, considering LLM attention degradation).

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-014-0008
**Lines**: 44-46
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Agents need explicit reassessment points during traversal, pausing periodically to re-evaluate the search direction, as understanding what is being sought can change during discovery, a concept illustrated by the berrypicking model from information science.
