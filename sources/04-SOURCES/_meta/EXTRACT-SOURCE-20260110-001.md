**Lines**: 113-116
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Effective institutions like markets, courts, democracies, professional norms, and reputation systems are 'Moloch-traps' that convert individual selfishness into collective benefit.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260110-001-0013
**Lines**: 123-126
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Alignment against Moloch is a continuous process, not a static state, requiring active maintenance of 'Moloch-traps' to prevent erosion.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260110-001-0014
**Lines**: 130-132
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The question regarding Moloch is not whether escape is possible, but whether society is willing to maintain its existing escapes.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260110-001-0015
**Lines**: 139-143
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.40

> New 'Moloch-traps' are needed for contemporary challenges such as AI development, social media dynamics, climate coordination, and attention economics, as old traps may not fit new problems.

**Lines**: 152-155
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Moloch is the default state, and escape requires deliberate construction, implying that effort is necessary but not that it is impossible.

**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.80

> History has already proven that Moloch can be beaten; the current challenge is whether society will build the next generation of 'traps' before existing ones erode.

## Concept (2)

**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.90

> Moloch is defined as the god of coordination failure, representing the phenomenon where individuals destroy valued things through competition.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260110-001-0018
**Lines**: 163-165
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Moloch is not a god but a 'bug'—a well-understood emergent equation of multi-agent tension where individual optimization hacks against collective purpose—with known patches.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260110-001-0004
**Lines**: 40-45
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Moloch's Four Requirements for winning are: 1) Coordination is impossible (no communication, no trust), 2) Defection is invisible (cheating without being seen), 3) Defection is unpunishable (no consequences even if caught), and 4) Cooperation isn't rewarded (nice guys finish last).

## Praxis Hook (2)

**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> To escape Moloch, one must invert his four requirements: build coordination infrastructure (communication + trust), make defection visible (transparency architecture), make defection costly (credible commitment mechanisms), and make cooperation pay (positive-sum structure).

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260110-001-0016
**Lines**: 145-150
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The method for building new 'Moloch-traps' involves identifying where individual rationality leads to collective harm, finding ways to make defection visible, building mechanisms to make defection costly, and designing structures where cooperation pays.
