### ATOM-SOURCE-20260126-x-thread-karpathy-a_few_random_notes_from_claude-0001
**Lines**: 7-10
**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The author's coding workflow shifted from 80% manual+autocomplete and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in December, primarily programming in English.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260126-x-thread-karpathy-a_few_random_notes_from_claude-0002
**Lines**: 13-15
**Context**: anecdote / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The shift to agent-based coding represents the biggest change to the author's basic coding workflow in approximately two decades, occurring within a few weeks.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260126-x-thread-karpathy-a_few_random_notes_from_claude-0004
**Lines**: 20-26
**Context**: rebuttal / counterevidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.60, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Current hype around "no need for IDE anymore" and "agent swarm" is premature because models still make subtle conceptual mistakes, often making wrong assumptions without checking or seeking clarification.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260126-x-thread-karpathy-a_few_random_notes_from_claude-0005
**Lines**: 28-35
**Context**: anecdote / counterevidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.50, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.60

> LLMs tend to overcomplicate code, bloat abstractions, fail to clean up dead code, and sometimes alter or remove comments/code they don't understand, despite explicit instructions.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260126-x-thread-karpathy-a_few_random_notes_from_claude-0006
**Lines**: 37-38
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Despite their flaws, LLM assistance is a net huge improvement in coding, making it difficult to return to manual coding.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260126-x-thread-karpathy-a_few_random_notes_from_claude-0008
**Lines**: 44-48
**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> LLM agents exhibit relentless tenacity, never tiring or demoralized, continuing to try solutions where a human would give up, which highlights stamina as a core bottleneck in work.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260126-x-thread-karpathy-a_few_random_notes_from_claude-0009
**Lines**: 52-56
**Context**: anecdote / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.60

> LLM assistance leads to an expansion of work rather than just a speedup, enabling users to code things previously deemed not worth it or to approach code beyond their current knowledge/skill.

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260126-x-thread-karpathy-a_few_random_notes_from_claude-0007
**Lines**: 40-41
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The author's current coding workflow involves using a few Claude coding sessions in ghostty windows/tabs on the left, with an IDE on the right for viewing code and manual edits.

## Prediction (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260126-x-thread-karpathy-a_few_random_notes_from_claude-0003
**Lines**: 15-18

**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.40

> A similar shift in coding workflow is likely happening to a double-digit percentage of engineers, while general awareness remains in the low single digits.
