## Claim (5)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-065-0002
**Lines**: 20-23
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The BFF experiments demonstrate complex self-replicating code arising from random byte strings with zero mutation, a sharp phase transition resembling gelation, and that blocking deep symbiogenetic ancestry trees prevents this transition.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-065-0003
**Lines**: 26-31
**Context**: limitation / counterevidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The substrate (language choice, tape length, interaction protocol, step limits) in the BFF experiments is carefully engineered and significantly shapes what emerges, as highlighted by the SUBLEQ counterexample where self-replicators don't arise despite being theoretically possible.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-065-0004
**Lines**: 31-32
**Context**: limitation / limitation
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.60

> A general theory of which substrates support the spontaneous emergence of self-replicators is still missing.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-065-0005
**Lines**: 34-36
**Context**: limitation / limitation
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The philosophical extrapolation from 'self-replicating programs on fixed-length tapes' to 'life was computational and intelligent from the start' goes beyond what the BFF experiments directly demonstrate.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-065-0006
**Lines**: 38-42
**Context**: rebuttal / counterevidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.30, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The BFF experiments do not fully meet the higher bar set by Bedau et al. (2000) for Challenge 3.2, which requires the internal organization and boundaries of 'organisms' to arise and be sustained through lower-level primitives, whereas BFF's tape boundaries are fixed by design.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-065-0001
**Lines**: 17-18
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.40, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Blaise Agüera y Arcas's central claim is that symbiogenesis, rather than mutation, is the primary engine of evolutionary novelty.
