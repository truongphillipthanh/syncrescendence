## Analogy (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251123-1018-0003
**Lines**: 35-39
**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Current AI models are like a neural network that 'solves' a spiral shape by drawing tiny straight lines that mimic the spiral, rather than understanding the concept of spiraling itself. This suggests AI fakes understanding without internal 'thinking'.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251123-1018-0005
**Lines**: 44-46
**Context**: method / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Standard AI attempts to solve a maze by instantly guessing the entire path from an overview, whereas a Continuous Thought Machine (CTM) 'walks' through the maze step-by-step, allowing for iterative problem-solving.

## Claim (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251123-1018-0001
**Lines**: 10-13
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.30, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.40

> The Transformer architecture, despite powering most modern AI, might be hindering the discovery of true intelligent reasoning by trapping the industry in a localized rut.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251123-1018-0006
**Lines**: 47-50
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Continuous Thought Machines (CTM) allow AI to 'ponder' by spending more time on difficult problems, enabling self-correction and backtracking, which current Language Models struggle to do genuinely.

## Concept (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251123-1018-0002
**Lines**: 20-24
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Success capture is a phenomenon where an industry focuses on making small tweaks to a successful architecture (like Transformers) rather than seeking fundamental new advancements, due to the architecture's current effectiveness.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251123-1018-0004
**Lines**: 41-42
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.10, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.30

> Continuous Thought Machines (CTM) are a biology-inspired AI model designed to fundamentally change how AI processes information, moving beyond the limitations of current architectures.

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251123-1018-0007
**Lines**: 52-55
**Context**: method / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Sakana AI's culture is modeled after the early days of Google Brain/DeepMind, fostering research freedom and encouraging informal discussions among researchers to generate novel ideas, similar to how the Transformer was conceived.
