**Lines**: 70-73
**Context**: consensus / limitation
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.60

**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.90

> Moltbot does not require a Mac Mini; a free-tier VPS on Amazon or a $5/month plan on Hostinger or Hetzner is sufficient due to minimal software requirements (Node.js 22, API key, messaging channel).
