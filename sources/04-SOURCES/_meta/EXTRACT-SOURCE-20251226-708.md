## Claim (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251226-708-0001
**Lines**: 22-25
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The success of Anthropic's CLI agent, "Claude Code," is primarily due to a radical simplification in its architecture, specifically a single-threaded "Master Loop" combined with highly capable models, rather than complex agentic frameworks.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251226-708-0004
**Lines**: 28-30
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The "Todo" planning mechanism, sandboxing, and system prompts play a critical role in making Claude Code reliable for production engineering tasks.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251226-708-0002
**Lines**: 25-27
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The "give it tools and get out of the way" approach describes an agent architecture that provides powerful tools to a highly capable model and minimizes complex orchestrating frameworks, contrasting with earlier, more brittle DAG-based (Directed Acyclic Graph) architectures.

## Framework (1)

**Lines**: 27-28
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Claude Code's internal tools include Bash, FileEdit, and Grep, which are critical for its operation.
