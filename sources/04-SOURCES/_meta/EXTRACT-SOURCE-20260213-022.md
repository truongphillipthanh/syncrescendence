## Concept (6)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260213-022-0002
**Lines**: 6-10
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The Intake layer (L1) of an orchestration spine is the 'front door' where all incoming tasks, links, or messages are captured, preventing loss of information before work begins.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260213-022-0003
**Lines**: 11-14
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.80

> The Coordination layer (L2) handles task routing and planning, acting as a 'traffic controller' to decide which agent performs which task.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260213-022-0004
**Lines**: 15-18
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.80

> The Execution layer (L3) is where agents perform their work, taking action, delegating sub-tasks, and spawning sub-agents as needed.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260213-022-0005
**Lines**: 19-23
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The Synthesis layer (L4) aggregates results from agents, resolves conflicts, and creates a clean brief, preventing agent work from failing to translate into decisions.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260213-022-0006
**Lines**: 24-27
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The Validation layer (L5) performs quality checks on output, ensuring system health and preventing small errors from accumulating into garbage results.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260213-022-0007
**Lines**: 28-28
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The 'intelligence mesh' is a shared brain that allows every agent across all orchestration layers to access what other agents have learned, enabling seamless communication and collaboration without human intervention.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260213-022-0001
**Lines**: 3-5
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Orchestration in agent systems consists of five main layers: Intake, Coordination, Execution, Synthesis, and Validation. Most current systems only implement two or three of these layers.
