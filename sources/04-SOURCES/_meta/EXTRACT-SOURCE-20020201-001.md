> Mathematicians, scientists, engineers, musicians, architects, designers, writers, and painters have historically used the term "beautiful" to describe good work, suggesting an underlying commonality in their understanding of quality.

**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The common belief that "taste is subjective" often stems from an inability to articulate why one likes something, leading to a tangle of unexamined impulses.

**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The only style worth having is the one you can't help, especially for strangeness, and there is no shortcut to achieving it; one must go through 'good' and emerge on the other side.
