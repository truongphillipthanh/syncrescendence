## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260202-001-0004

**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The shift from 'Process' to 'Entity' in AI agents means agents now persist over time, accumulate context, and take unsolicited actions, fundamentally changing how software is managed from input control to setting expectations, permissions, and boundaries.

## Framework (1)
