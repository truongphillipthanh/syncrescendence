## Claim (3)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260214-014-0001
**Lines**: 1-2
**Context**: anecdote / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.40

> The most effective OpenClaw setups are often created by individuals who lack coding skills, which is not coincidental.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260214-014-0003
**Lines**: 7-7
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> AI models respond most effectively to clear and structured instructions.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260214-014-0006
**Lines**: 17-18
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The ability to translate a vision into clear instructions is currently the most valuable skill for success with AI.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260214-014-0002
**Lines**: 3-6
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.50

> A lack of coding ability forces individuals to develop superior communication skills, particularly in articulating problems and instructions, because they cannot rely on brute-force technical solutions.

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260214-014-0004
**Lines**: 11-13
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> To effectively instruct AI, focus on clearly defining: what the AI should do, the sequence of operations, and the criteria for completion.

## Prediction (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260214-014-0005
**Lines**: 15-16
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.30

> The importance of clear prompting for AI models will persist for many years, likely until technology allows direct intent reading from the human brain.
