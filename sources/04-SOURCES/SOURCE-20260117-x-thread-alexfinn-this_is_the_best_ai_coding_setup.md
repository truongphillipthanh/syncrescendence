synopsis: "Thread describing a dual-agent coding setup using Codex 5.2 xhigh and Claude Code Opus 4.5 side by side. Workflow involves Claude Code for planning, Codex for validation, and cross-review between both agents for quality assurance."
key_insights:
  - "Using two competing AI coding agents in parallel with cross-review produces higher quality output than either alone"
  - "Claude Code excels at planning while Codex excels at validation and fixing, creating a complementary workflow"
  - "The dual-agent setup feels like managing a team of engineers and produces apps significantly faster"

# Claude Code + Codex 5.2 AI Coding Setup Thread

This is the best AI coding setup ever:

**Codex 5.2 xhigh on the left, Claude Code Opus 4.5 on the right**

1. Start building with Claude Code in plan mode
2. Copy and paste every plan into Codex. Validate the plan. If they have any critical feedback, give it back to CC
3. Any time CC messes up, go back to Codex and have it fix the issue
4. Every change either agent makes, ask the other agent to review it
5. Primarily use whichever agent that is the last one to clean up the other's mess

Not only will you produce apps 10x faster, you'll have fun just feeling like you're managing a team of engineers

Trust me, the results are worth the price you pay

I made an entire community for vibe coders using claude code. It's pretty cool, we all hang out and build stuff. I think you should join:
