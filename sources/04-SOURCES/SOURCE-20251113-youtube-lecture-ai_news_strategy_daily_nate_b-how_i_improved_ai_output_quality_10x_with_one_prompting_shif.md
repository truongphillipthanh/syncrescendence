What’s really happening inside prompt engineering when you aim for “just enough” detail?
The common story is that more clarity always helps — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on finding the right altitude for LLM prompts:
• Why over-specifying kills creativity and burns context
• How under-prompting forces large language models to guess
• What Goldilocks prompting unlocks in Claude, GPT-5, and Gemini
• Where short, reusable prompt “slugs” outperform long instruction dumps

A balanced prompting strategy gives operators and teams more control without crushing model judgment.
