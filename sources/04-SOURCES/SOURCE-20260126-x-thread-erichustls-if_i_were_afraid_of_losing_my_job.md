If I were afraid of losing my job to AI & had 6 months to save myself, here's exactly what I'd do:

- Stop pretending my job is secure
- Accept that AI is coming for me
- Research 5 niches (Google Trends)
- Pick one that triggers insecurity
- Create an Instagram with Namelix
- Design a logo with Nano Banana
- Write a bio with ChatGPT
- Install ViralFindr for proven content
- Find 10 competitors in my niche
- Analyze their top-performing posts
- Recreate 2 posts per day (Canva AI)
- Schedule it all with Later(.com)
- Spend 30 minutes daily on content
- Post consistently for 30 days
- Hit 5,000 followers
- Start getting DMs from brands
- Set up affiliate links
- Reach 25,000 followers
- Land first brand deal ($500)
- Add 3 more monetization streams
- Hit $2,000/month
- Automate content with ChatGPT
- Scale to 50,000 followers
- Hire a freelancer ($150/month)
- Start a 2nd page in a different niche
- Hit $5,000/month combined
- Work less than 15 minutes per day
- Build a portfolio of 3-5 pages
- Automate 95% with freelancers
- Hit $10,000+/month passively
- Quit the corporate job
- Actually have time for family

This exact system took me from stressed corporate sales to $90k/month in automated income.

No face. No filming. No experience.

Just AI, proven systems, and 6 months of consistency.

Lock in. You can do this.
