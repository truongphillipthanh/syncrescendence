# K-Shaped Economy: The AI Divide
In 10 years, there will be two classes of people.
Economists call it the "K-shaped economy" - and the next 2-3 years will decide which line you're on.
- An overclass that uses AI as a lever to build wealth, automate income, and make decisions at a speed no human can compete with alone.
- And an underclass that gets managed by it.
This isn't just "coming". It's already happening.
## Some mind-blowing stats:
- Workers with AI skills earn 56% more than the same job without them. That premium doubled in a single year.
- Industries adopting AI are seeing 3x the revenue growth per employee.
- Meanwhile, 90% of workers haven't taken a single hour of AI training.
- Goldman Sachs estimates 300 million jobs will be affected by AI by 2028. That's 24 months from now.
If you're reading this now and you haven't built systems with AI - haven't automated a single workflow, haven't used it to create anything that makes you money or makes you irreplaceable - you are currently on the wrong line.
That's not an insult. You have the agency to change your trajectory right now.
But six months from now, the gap will be twice as wide. And a year from now, it may not be crossable.
(Description: A line chart titled "Figure 1: Projected K-Shaped Economic Trajectory Post-2025 Integration" showing economic output from 2020 to 2030. Two diverging lines originate from 2025: a blue line labeled "High Agency + AI Mastery" curves sharply upward, while a red line labeled "Low Agency + Managed by AI" curves downward. The legend indicates: Blue represents high agency (adaptive, autonomous) + AI mastery, while red represents low agency (dependent, automated) + managed by AI.)
