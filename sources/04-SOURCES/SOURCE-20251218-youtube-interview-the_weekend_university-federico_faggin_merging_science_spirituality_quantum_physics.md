# Federico Faggin: Merging Science & Spirituality, Quantum Physics, Meaning, & Free Will

**Channel**: The Weekend University
**Published**: 2025-12-18
**Duration**: 1h 39s

## Description (no transcript available)

Dr. Federico Faggin is a physicist, engineer, and the inventor of the microprocessor - the technology which paved the way for the digital age; making modern computing, the internet, and smartphones possible. In recent decades, Federico has turned his attention to developing a scientific theory of consciousness based on the latest developments in quantum physics. 

In this conversation, we explore:

— How “quantum fields” may possess consciousness and free will as fundamental properties

— Why meaning, not information alone, is the foundation of reality

— How Federico’s theory explains the relationship between the body, mind, and consciousness

— Why cooperation and love, rather than competition, emerge as the natural organizing principles in this framework

And more.

You can learn more about Dr. Faggin's work in his book "Irreducible". 

—

Federico Faggin, born in Vicenza, Italy, is a physicist and pioneering inventor in computing. He co-designed one of Italy’s first transistorized computers, developed the MOS Silicon Gate Technology, and led the creation of the world’s first microprocessor, the Intel 4004.

He founded Zilog, Cygnet Technologies, and Synaptics, pioneering innovations like the Z80 microprocessor, Touchpad, and Touchscreen. Today, he leads the Federico and Elvia Faggin Foundation, advancing the scientific study of consciousness.

Faggin has received major honors including the Marconi Prize, Kyoto Prize, National Medal of Technology, and induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. His autobiography, SILICON: From the Invention of the Microprocessor to the New Science of Consciousness, is available worldwide.
