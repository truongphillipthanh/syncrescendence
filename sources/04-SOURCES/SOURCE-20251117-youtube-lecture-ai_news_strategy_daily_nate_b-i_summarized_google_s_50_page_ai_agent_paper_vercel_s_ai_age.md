_______________________
Google and Vercel can't agree on the way forward for AI agents. 
The usual story is that big companies already have incredible multi-agent orchestration systems and we all need to get more complex. The reality is very different.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on the competing visions for AI agents:
• Why Google pushes a long-horizon orchestration platform
• How Vercel extracts ROI from verifiable back-office tasks
• What the Claude Code hack exposed about model-layer security
• Where orchestration, context curation, and human roles actually converge

The takeaway: operators who want value today should target low-friction, verifiable workflows while preparing for a future where orchestration platforms govern hundreds of autonomous agents.
