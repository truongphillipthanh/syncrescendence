I've been personally burning through billions of tokens a week for the past few months as a builder. Today I'm excited to announce Hyperagent, by Airtable.
An agents platform where every session gets its own isolated, full computing environment in the cloud — no Mac Mini required. Real browser, code execution, image/video generation, data warehouse access, hundreds of integrations, and the ability to learn any new API as a skill.
Deep domain expertise through skill learning. Teach the agent how your firm evaluates startups or how your team runs due diligence — now anyone on the team gets output that reflects your actual methodology, not a generic template.
One-click deployment into Slack as intelligent coworkers. These aren't bots that wait to be @mentioned — they follow conversations, understand context, and act when relevant.
And a command center to oversee and continuously improve your entire fleet of agents at scale.
We're onboarding early users now. [hyperagent.com](http://hyperagent.com)
