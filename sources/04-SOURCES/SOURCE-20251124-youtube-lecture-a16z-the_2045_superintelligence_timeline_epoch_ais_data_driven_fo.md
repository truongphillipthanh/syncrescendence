## Description (no transcript available)

Epoch AI researchers reveal why Anthropic might beat everyone to the first gigawatt datacenter, why AI could solve the Riemann hypothesis in 5 years, and what 30% GDP growth actually looks like. They explain why "energy bottlenecks" are just companies complaining about paying 2x for power instead of getting it cheap, why 10% of current jobs will vanish this decade, and the most data-driven take on whether we're racing toward superintelligence or headed for history's biggest bubble.
