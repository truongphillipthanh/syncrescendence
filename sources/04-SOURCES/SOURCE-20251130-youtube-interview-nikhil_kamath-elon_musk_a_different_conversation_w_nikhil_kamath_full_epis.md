## Description (no transcript available)

A long conversation with #ElonMusk about work, consciousness, family, money, AI and how the future might unfold.

No script, no performance, just two people thinking out loud.

A big thank you to Manoj Ladwa - a close friend of many years and a remarkable connector of India to the world and the world to India. Through India Global Forum, he has built one of the most influential platforms showcasing India’s rise. As I’ve said before, this is India’s decade, and leaders like Manoj Ladwa and @IndiaGlobalForum  will be the flag bearers in making that a reality.
