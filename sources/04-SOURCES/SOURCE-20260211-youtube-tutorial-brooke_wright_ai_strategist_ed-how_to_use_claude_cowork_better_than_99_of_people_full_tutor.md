Claude Cowork is a new feature inside the Claude Desktop app that gives AI direct access to your files and folders. No terminal. No code. You describe what you want done, walk away, and come back to finished work.
In this video, I test it on five real tasks from my actual business — organising files, editing podcast video into short-form clips, analysing transcript themes and content gaps, running a full brand voice review of my email marketing, and building a productivity dashboard connected to Gmail, Google Calendar, and Notion.
The result? One tool replaced what would normally take five separate apps and hours of manual work.
