# Google's AI Knows Everything About You (We Said Yes)

**Channel**: AI For Humans
**Published**: 2026-01-16
**Duration**: 55m 25s

## Description (no transcript available)

Apple just handed Siri over to Google Gemini. Meanwhile, Google's Personal Intelligence wants to crawl ALL your data. This is the AI lock-in war of 2026 and you're the prize.

Plus, Claude Cowork dropped (and they built it in two weeks), Grok can no longer put bikinis on people, and the US military is apparently running on Grok 4.20. Cool cool cool.

We've also got the world's biggest Twitch streamer being an AI anime girl, Google's Universal Commerce Protocol making AI shopping actually possible, and Gavin walks through building a personal website with Claude Code that doesn't suck.

THIS IS THE LOCK-IN EPISODE. YOUR DATA IS THE HARNESS.
