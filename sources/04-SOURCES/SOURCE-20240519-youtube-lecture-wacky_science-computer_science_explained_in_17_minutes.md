How do Computers even work? Let's learn (pretty much) all of Computer Science in about 15 minutes with memes and bouncy music. At least the stuff worth remembering if you want to get into programming.
Of course this is not ALL of Computer Science, but I tried to condense a broad spectrum of topics as fast as possible, which could be a good revision for some, or an introduction for others :)
