## Description (no transcript available)

America’s industrial muscle is coming back. In 2026, a16z General Partner Erin Price-Wright predicts that founders will tackle energy, mining, construction, and manufacturing with a factory mindset powered by AI and autonomy.

This means faster permitting, quicker design cycles, better coordination, and deploying robots where work is dangerous or slow. Apply assembly-line thinking to the physical world, and we can mass-produce nuclear reactors, build the housing we need, and construct data centers at record speed.
