The hype train is 2026 knows only Moltbot (RIP Clawdbot). In this episode, we unpack the viral open-source AI assistant that's taken over the internet what it actually does, why everyone's losing their minds, and whether it's worth the $750/day token bills some users are racking up. We dive deep into why locally-run skills and CLI tools are beating computer-use clicking, how smaller models like GPT-5 Mini are crushing it in agentic workflows, and why the real magic is in targeted context - not massive swarms. Plus: Kimi K2.5 drops as a near-Sonnet-level model at 1/10th the price, we debate whether SaaS is dead, and yes – there are TWO Kimi K2.5 diss tracks. One made by Opus pretending to be Kimi. It might just slap?
