Today’s AI Daily Brief breaks down the stunning leap unlocked by Google’s Nano Banana Pro image model, which isn’t just an upgrade but a wholesale expansion of what’s possible with AI image generation. From real text rendering to accurate charts, whiteboard-style compression of dense documents, educational visuals, flowcharts, technical drawings, virtual staging, precise spot-editing, and media-to-media transformations, this episode covers 25 capabilities that genuinely didn’t exist in the previous state of the art and explains why this model’s reasoning-on-images paradigm represents one of the biggest practical unlocks in years.
