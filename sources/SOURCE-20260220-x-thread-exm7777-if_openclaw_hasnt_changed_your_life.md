# OpenClaw: How to Get Insane Results from the Lobster
if openclaw hasn't changed your life yet, that's a skill issue... here's how to get insane results from the lobster:
## 1. Your main agent prompt is everything
don't just tell it what to do... engineer it like you're building a co-founder you want to talk to every single day
this is where most people half-ass it and wonder why their outputs suck
## 2. Run a deep interview
prompt openclaw to interrogate you about your business, goals, workflows... spend 2 hours if you have to
the quality of what goes in defines the quality of what comes out, no shortcuts here
## 3. Train the memory system manually for the first week
show it exactly what's worth remembering and what's noise, it will make a crazy difference
also install supermemory... it's a different experience entirely when recall works
## 4. Use GPT-5.3-Codex as your main model
nothing touches it right now for agentic work, but assign MiniMax to subagents that don't need heavy reasoning... save 90%+ on costs
## 5. Build a "skill builder" skill
one that recognizes when a task might repeat based on your context and turns it into a reusable workflow automatically
### Most importantly
the more you guide your agent towards what YOU really want, the better it gets
it sounds stupid but making sure it creates markdown files for specific things like todos, best coding practices, SOPs... it's just like when working with LLMs: the more context, the better experience
there are A LOT repos you could clone, MCPs to set up, tools to build on top
but these things alone will get you 80% of the way there
