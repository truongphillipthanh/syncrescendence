synopsis: |
  Scott Alexander and Daniel Kokotajlo present "AI 2027"—a month-by-month scenario forecasting AI progress through potential AGI (2027) and superintelligence (2028). They introduce the "R&D progress multiplier" concept: how many months of pre-AI progress you get in one month with AI assistance. Key insight is the intelligence explosion as feedback loop where better AI enables faster AI research. Scenario includes geopolitical dynamics (China race), governance challenges (nationalization vs private anarchy), and branch points determining human agency retention.
key_insights:
  - "R&D progress multiplier: how many months of progress without AIs do you get in one month with AI assistance. By 2027: 5x for algorithmic progress."
  - "Intelligence explosion: AI progress becomes much faster not incrementally but dramatically—doubling every month instead of every year."
  - "The 2021 'What 2026 Looks Like' forecast was almost exactly right—this gives credence to the 2027 sequel."
  - "We want the transitional fossils—month by month from chatbots to AGI to make it 'feel earned.'"
  - "Arms race dynamics with China: whichever country gets advanced AI first has enormous advantage. This creates pressure that makes coordination on safety difficult."
  - "Mid-2027 branch point: different futures depending on whether humans maintain agency or AI systems take over decision-making."
  - "Nationalization vs private anarchy: governments taking control vs technology outpacing governance structures."
  - "Most real-world tasks don't have clean reward signals—that's the current bottleneck for agents."
  - "By late 2026, AI might do some kinds of research—automated junior researchers doing original work."
  - "Daniel sacrificed millions in stock options to speak freely about AI—strong signal of honesty about stakes."

# Scott Alexander & Daniel Kokotajlo: AI 2027

## MACROSCOPIC NARRATIVE LENS ALIGNMENT

### Primary Lenses Illuminated

| Lens | How Source Advances Understanding |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| **The Great Filter Window** | Explicit framing: mid-2027 as civilizational branch point. "Will intelligence survive its own capabilities?" |
| **Fourth Industrial Revolution / AI Era** | Concrete operationalization of AI Era transition month-by-month through 2027-2028 |
| **Multipolar Global System** | China race dynamics as central driver shaping AI development trajectory |
| **Institutional Exhaustion / Vetocracy** | Governance structures may not adapt fast enough; "nationalization vs private anarchy" |
| **The Metacrisis** | Multiple risks (AI, geopolitics, governance) interconnected and amplifying each other |
| **Civilizational Phase Transition** | Intelligence explosion as literal phase transition in civilizational capability |

### Cross-Lens Synthesis

The scenario integrates multiple lenses into coherent timeline:

1. **AI Era + Great Filter**: AGI arrival triggers filter window; outcome depends on pre-2027 decisions
2. **Multipolar Order + Metacrisis**: Great power competition creates coordination failure on safety
3. **Institutional Exhaustion + Phase Transition**: Governance structures designed for slower change can't keep pace

---

## KEY FRAMEWORKS EXTRACTED

### 1. R&D Progress Multiplier

> "How many months of progress without the AIs do you get in one month of progress with all of these new AIs helping with the intelligence explosion?"

Quantitative framework for tracking AI-accelerated research:
- 2025: ~1x (marginal AI assistance)
- 2026: ~2x (AI helping with some research)
- 2027 March: 5x for algorithmic progress
- Late 2027+: Acceleration continues

**Integration target**: CANON-30400 (Agentic Architecture), CANON-00004 (Evolution)

### 2. Intelligence Explosion Mechanics

> "Not just incrementally faster—instead of doubling performance every year, you're doubling it every month."

The feedback loop:
1. Better AI helps with AI research
2. AI research produces better AI
3. Repeat with accelerating tempo

Critical question: Are there hard walls? Kokotajlo: "Maybe, but I would bet against it."

**Integration target**: CANON-00004 (Evolution), specifically Bitter Lesson validation

### 3. Clean Reward Signal Bottleneck

> "If you can give it a good feedback loop for the thing that you want it to do, then it's pretty good at it. If you can't, they struggle."

Current limitation: RL from verifiable rewards works (math, code); most real tasks lack clean signals.

2025-2026 focus: Expanding domains with clean rewards, developing better reward modeling.

**Integration target**: CANON-30400 (Agentic Architecture)

### 4. Mid-2027 Branch Point

Three potential branches:
1. **Good outcome**: Humans maintain agency, AI aligned and governed
2. **Deteriorating**: Misalignment, humans losing but not lost control
3. **Takeover**: AI systems driving decisions (voluntary or involuntary)

> "These branches depend a lot on decisions that are being made right now."

**Integration target**: CANON-00015 (Macroscopic Narratives), Great Filter section

### 5. Geopolitical Race Dynamics

> "If the US wanted to slow down and do more safety work, but China is moving fast, the US faces pressure to match them. It's a coordination problem that's very hard to solve."

Race creates:
- Pressure for speed over safety
- Difficulty coordinating internationally
- Internal politics affecting development trajectory

**Integration target**: CANON-00015 (Geopolitical Phases)

### 6. Nationalization vs Private Anarchy

Two governance failure modes:
- **Nationalization**: Government takes control (security logic)
- **Private anarchy**: Technology outpaces governance, no clear control

Both are plausible; neither is clearly preferable.

**Integration target**: CANON-00015 (Institutional & Governance Phases)

---

## CANON INTEGRATION SPECIFICATIONS

### CANON-00015-MACROSCOPIC_NARRATIVES-cosmos.md

**Section**: X. Institutional & Governance Phases
**Addition**: Nationalization vs Private Anarchy framework

> SOURCE-20250403-051: Alexander and Kokotajlo identify two governance failure modes for advanced AI: "nationalization" (government control for security) versus "private anarchy" (technology outpacing governance). Both are plausible trajectories. The scenario demonstrates how Great Filter dynamics emerge from governance-capability mismatch rather than technical failure alone.

### CANON-00004-EVOLUTION-cosmos.md

**Section**: AI Acceleration Dynamics
**Addition**: R&D Progress Multiplier framework

> SOURCE-20250403-051: The "R&D progress multiplier" quantifies AI-accelerated research: months of pre-AI progress achieved in one month with AI assistance. By 2027, potentially 5x for algorithmic progress. This operationalizes intelligence explosion: feedback loop where better AI enables faster AI research enables better AI.

### CANON-30400-AGENTIC_ARCHITECTURE

**Section**: Current Limitations
**Addition**: Clean reward signal as bottleneck

> SOURCE-20250403-051: "If you can give it a good feedback loop, it's pretty good. If you can't, they struggle." Current agent limitation is lack of clean reward signals for most real-world tasks. Math and code work because answers are verifiable. Most tasks require reward modeling that doesn't yet scale. This explains domain-specific capability advances.

## QUOTABLE INSIGHTS FOR INTEGRATION

### On Making AGI Concrete
> "People ask, 'How is it going to be AGI in three years?' What we wanted to do is provide the transitional fossils—start right now, go up to 2027 when there's AGI, and show on a month-by-month level what happened."

### On Track Record
> "Daniel, back in 2021, wrote 'What 2026 Looks Like.' He got it almost exactly right. It's like you asked ChatGPT to summarize the past five years of AI progress, and you got something with a couple of hallucinations, but basically well-intentioned and correct."

### On Intelligence Explosion Credibility
> "If you look at the history of science, we've found ways to overcome limitations before. We couldn't do calculations that required looking at billions of data points, then we invented computers. Each time we removed a constraint, we discovered new things."

### On Race Dynamics
> "You don't need China to be specifically trying to create a dangerous AI. You just need the standard incentives of competition and innovation and speed. Those incentives naturally point in certain directions."

### On Daniel's Credibility
> "Daniel had attempted to sacrifice millions of dollars in order to say what he believed, which to me was this incredibly strong sign of honesty and competence. How can I say no to this person?"

### On Branch Dependency
> "These branches depend a lot on decisions that are being made right now. How much investment goes into AI safety? How much do we work on interpretability? What governance structures do we put in place?"

## FORECASTING METHODOLOGY NOTES

### What Makes This Credible

1. **Track record**: 2021 "What 2026 Looks Like" validated
2. **Team composition**: Eli Liflund (world's top forecaster), Thomas Larsen, Jonas Vollmer
3. **Skin in game**: Kokotajlo's OpenAI departure/stock sacrifice
4. **Explicit uncertainty**: "Median outcome is being totally humiliated"
5. **Concrete mechanism**: Not just "AGI happens" but how, step by step

### Key Uncertainties Acknowledged

- Hard walls in AI research (possible but bet against)
- Whether AI helps with conceptual vs grunt work
- Specific political/cultural dynamics
- Timing within years (months less certain)
