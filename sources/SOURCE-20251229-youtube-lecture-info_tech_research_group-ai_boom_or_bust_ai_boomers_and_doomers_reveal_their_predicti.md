## Description (no transcript available)

Is artificial intelligence humanity’s greatest salvation, or the most dangerous force we’ve ever unleashed?

Artificial intelligence is no longer a future concept, it’s a force already reshaping geopolitics, economics, warfare, and the human experience itself. In this year in review episode of Digital Disruption, we bring together the most provocative, conflicting, and urgent ideas from this past year to confront the biggest question of our time: What does AI actually mean for humanity’s future?

Across more than 40 conversations with leading technologists, journalists, researchers, and futurists, one theme dominated every debate, AI. Some guests argue that artificial general intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence could trigger an extinction-level event. Others believe AI may usher in an era of total abundance, solving humanity’s hardest problems. And still others claim today’s AI hype is little more than marketing smoke and mirrors.

This episode puts those worldviews head-to-head.

In this episode:
00:00 The AI singularity is here
05:00 Existential threat or greatest opportunity?
10:00 Why no one agrees on ai’s future
15:00 The race toward AGI and superintelligence
20:00 The control problem nobody has solved
25:00 Intelligence has no morality
30:00 Capitalism, venture capital, and the AI arms race
35:00 Is AI just a marketing illusion?
40:00 Generative AI: Power, limits, and misuse
45:00 Autonomous weapons and modern warfare
50:00 Fear as the driver of dangerous innovation
55:00 Why AI is not like nuclear weapons
1:00:00 The first and second AI dilemmas
1:05:00 Handing decisions over to machines
1:10:00 Collapse, abundance, or course correction?
