synopsis: "Argues that the software index (IGV) decline is just the first cloud of a coming storm as intelligence commodification disrupts far beyond SaaS. Positions compute as a weapon that can defend or lay siege to corporate moats, predicting companies will race to secure compute supply as compute risk is repriced."
key_insights: ["Compute is becoming a weapon that can defend a castle or lay siege to one — companies that secure compute supply will survive", "The SaaS disruption visible in the IGV decline is only the beginning; intelligence commodification will impact every sector", "As compute risk is repriced, securing supply will become an existential corporate priority comparable to securing raw materials"]

# The Coming Corporate War for Compute

## As compute risk is repriced, companies will race to secure supply

Over the past two weeks we've seen a significant decline in the IGV (software index) on the premise that AI will erode the moats of traditional SaaS companies. I suspect this is only the very first cloud on the horizon for what is going to grow over the next few years to be a storm of biblical proportions.

The world is changing rapidly. The market is learning. Sauron's eye is scanning. Where is the change? Where is the disruption? What is happening? You don't commodify intelligence and genuinely think that all that will be impacted is SaaS...

## Compute is becoming a weapon. A weapon that can defend a castle, or lay siege to one.

For ~15 years, cloud services were basically a utility: email, CRM, storage, basic SaaS. It was a rounding error in most cost structures (~3-5% of OpEx), so nobody built a strategy around it. The world's corporations were OK to outsource it. It made enough sense.

AI changes the nature of cloud services permanently. We're moving into a world where compute is a primary input to everything: R&D, product velocity, customer support + sales automation, personalization/pricing, and internal operations/decision-making.

When compute goes from ~3% of OpEx to 15–30%+, it stops being an IT line item. It becomes a strategic asset.

And strategic assets have only two states: you control them, or someone else controls you.

If you're renting compute from a hyperscaler with no priority, no long-term reservation, no leverage - you're not really a customer. You're a tenant with a landlord. Renting was fine when you were renting a storage closet. It's not fine when you're renting the engine that determines your roadmap, margins, and time-to-market.

Some companies will soon realize that they don't want to be tenants to such a large portion of their COGS / OpEx & overall corporate strategy, so conversations will soon begin around building some compute on prem, with plans to expand over time.

Many companies will not be able to - not because they lack intent, but because they lack supply lines.

The hyperscalers are buying the supply lines: they have the capital to pre-buy capacity, the relationships and volume commitments with NVIDIA, the power + interconnect + facilities at scale, and the software layer that keeps workloads sticky. They aren't just acquiring GPUs. They're acquiring control.

That creates a flywheel: companies realize compute is strategic → they try to secure it → meaningful allocation is hard → they retreat to the cloud → cloud priority + pricing power increases → urgency spikes → repeat.

This is why "compute strategy" is about to become a board-level topic, right next to capital allocation, supply chain risk, energy procurement, and cybersecurity. If you're a Fortune 500 CEO without a compute plan, the question is coming: "What's our AI compute strategy, and what happens if capacity tightens?"

And it's why hyperscaler AI capex likely trends toward something like ~$600B versus the Street's ~$450B. This isn't "overbuilding." It's an arms race. Whoever controls the most compute controls the next decade of enterprise technology - and they're not going to slow down.

A bifurcation is coming: Tier 1 (hyperscalers, sovereigns, and the biggest enterprises who moved early enough to lock supply via on-prem, long-term reservations, captive builds, or hybrid control) will control their destiny. Tier 2 - everyone else - will rent capacity, accept allocation risk, and inherit cloud margin targets.

I expect Sauron's eye of the market will soon shift to this topic. "What is your compute strategy?" and if the answer is insufficient, there will a risk repricing.

The cloud model worked when cloud services were a minor utility expense. AI turns compute into a weapon - and weapons are about control. The companies that realize that early will survive. The ones that don't will show up to a war with no weapons.

The market is focused on hyperscaler FCF today, but tomorrow, I suspect they won't be questioning the hyperscalers, but rather everyone else who has no access to compute or plans to acquire it.
