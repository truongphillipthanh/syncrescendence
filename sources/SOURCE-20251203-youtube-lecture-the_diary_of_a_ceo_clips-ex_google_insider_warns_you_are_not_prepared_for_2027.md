## Description (no transcript available)

Ex-Google design ethicist and AI expert Tristan Harris reveals the truth about what artificial intelligence is about to do to jobs, the economy, politics, and the future of human purpose. After years inside Google and more than a decade researching the social effects of technology, Tristan warns that we are approaching a moment where AI outpaces human control and reshapes society faster than governments can react.

Drawing on examples from social media, global trade, student debt, and national security, Tristan shows how AI will redefine every issue from immigration to democracy. He also shares the personal story behind his mission to warn the world before it is too late.

Discover:
• Why AI is eliminating jobs much faster than people realise
• The real reason UBI may not work in an AI-driven world
• How entire economies could collapse when key job sectors disappear
• Why junior workers and new graduates are at the highest risk
• How political power shifts when humans are no longer needed for labour
• The shocking rise of “AI immigrants” replacing cognitive work
• How AI will reshape education, healthcare, and national security
• The urgent steps needed to avoid a global economic crisis
