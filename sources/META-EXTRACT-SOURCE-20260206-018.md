> Love is currently mediated by social media feeds, with algorithms calibrating and observing affective fluctuations like longing, then feeding back content that stabilizes users in that state until it hardens into identity.

**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.70

> A single pause on content related to relationship grievances (e.g., "toxic men," "choosing yourself") can initiate escalation, as the system infers vulnerability and reclassifies a partner from person to problem.
