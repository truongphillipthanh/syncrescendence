## Claim (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251219-793-0001
**Lines**: 17-18
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Four specific AI tools can handle most of the AI agent needs for non-technical people, despite the common belief that agents require technical skills.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251219-793-0002
**Lines**: 30-30
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Agent reliability and risk are controlled by four 'knobs': Habitat (where the agent lives), Tools (what the agent can interact with), Constraints (how much freedom the agent has), and Proof (whether the agent can show its work).

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251219-793-0003
**Lines**: 31-31
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Non-technical users can effectively utilize four AI agents: Manus for internet research, Notion AI for workspace organization, Lovable for app building, and Zapier for logistics management.

## Prediction (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251219-793-0004
**Lines**: 48-49
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Professionals who learn to delegate outcomes to reliable AI agents will reclaim hours weekly, while those who wait for perfect AI will continue to do the work themselves.
