Welcome to Project #3 of the DevOps × AI Series!

Today we're deploying your containerized RAG API to Kubernetes. You'll set up a local Kubernetes cluster with Minikube, create Deployments and Services, and watch Kubernetes automatically manage your containers—handling restarts, networking, and scaling.

🧠 What you'll learn today:
Install Minikube and kubectl for local Kubernetes development
Start and manage a local Kubernetes cluster
Create Kubernetes Deployments to orchestrate your containers
Create Kubernetes Services for stable networking
Deploy and access your containerized API through Kubernetes
