## Description (no transcript available)

Claude Opus 4.6 has officially dropped and the game has changed. We are no longer just prompting single AI instances... we are orchestrating entire teams of agents in parallel.

In this video, I break down the new Agent Teams feature in Claude Code and show you how to build a global Tide & Sea Temperature app without writing a single line of code yourself. I set up a debate between a Backend Dev, a Frontend Dev, and a ruthless Devil’s Advocate agent to build the perfect app.
