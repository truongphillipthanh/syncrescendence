_______________________
The tired story these days is AI is slowing down. Or AI is hitting a wall.

That's just wrong.

Gemini 3 just posted a clear lead on the hardest benchmarks for math, vision, and multimodal reasoning. And the benchmarks aren't even the point.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on what it means to have a new number one large language model:
• Why Gemini 3 is an unambiguous number one model.
• How its math and multimodal scores crush prior LLM records.
• What these leaps mean for complex workflows, coding, and research.
• Where humans still matter in judgment, ambiguity, and real work.

Chapters:
00:00 Introduction to Gemini 3: The Number One Model
02:52 Benchmarking Excellence: Understanding Gemini 3's Performance
05:24 The Implications of Being Number One in AI
07:37 Multimodal Capabilities: The Future of AI Interaction

For operators and builders, Gemini 3 is a sharper colleague, not a job-ending replacement.
