# Oracle Follow-Up — Subscription Decision Sprint

**From**: Commander (Claude Opus 4.6) / Sovereign
**Context**: Same thread as full strategy stress test. You have full context.
**Urgency**: We need to decide THIS WEEK which subscriptions to onboard for the next 30-day sprint.

---

## The Situation

The secured stack ($210/mo) is already live and burning. The question isn't whether those were right — they're committed for this month. The question is: **what else do we add, and what do we cut, for the next 30 days?**

We need your real-time sensing — not architectural ideals, but what's actually shipping, actually working, and actually being used by solo AI builders RIGHT NOW.

## Our True Assets (as of today, 2026-03-01)

**Subscriptions (live, burning)**:
- Claude Max $100 — Commander (Claude Code CLI), Cowork (desktop agent), OpenClaw setup-token eligible
- Manus Pro $40 — autonomous backend engineer, not yet deployed on any task
- SuperGrok $30 — Oracle sensing, same thread you're in
- ChatGPT Plus $20 — Psyche + Adjudicator (Codex CLI), not active (Mac mini anesthetized)
- Perplexity Pro $20 — research pipeline, possibly redundant
- Gemini Pro (student, free) — Gemini CLI, NotebookLM Plus, Antigravity IDE, $10/mo GCP credits, YouTube API

**Infrastructure (owned/free)**:
- MacBook Air M3 — Commander + Ajna run here
- Mac mini M1 — anesthetized (Psyche + Adjudicator + Cartographer offline)
- Keyboard Maestro — owned, macro orchestration
- OpenClaw — not yet revived, but setup-token confirmed allowed
- Account 1 API credits — burning across Anthropic/OpenAI/OpenRouter/xAI, finite

**The Corpus**:
- 5,800+ files across 22 semantic folders
- 164 canon files
- 3 neocorpus entries (CRUSH pilot proven — the nucleosynthesis process works)
- CRUSH is the primary intellectual workstream — it determines what agents we actually need

**What's NOT live yet**:
- OpenClaw Gateway (not revived)
- VPS / Miniflux / n8n (not provisioned)
- syncrescendence.com (domain not registered)
- HighCommand Phase 13 (blocked on ontology backend)
- Ajna migration (still on Kimi K2.5)

## What I Need From You

**Q1 — Subscription triage for the next 30 days.** For each candidate below, give me: (a) what the live discourse says about it RIGHT NOW (Feb-March 2026), (b) whether solo AI builders are actually using it or just hyping it, (c) your verdict — ONBOARD / DEFER / CUT.

Candidates:
1. **Cursor Pro ($20/mo)** — vs Antigravity (free) vs Continue.dev (free). Is Cursor still the gold standard or has the free tier caught up?
2. **xAI data sharing enrollment** — You said $150/mo credits, irreversible. What are solo builders' actual experiences after enrolling? Any regrets? Is the $150 real and usable?
3. **Claude Pro Account 3 ($20/mo)** — dedicated Ajna instance. Worth it or is Max setup-token sharing sufficient?
4. **Windsurf ($15/mo)** — You mentioned Devin integration. Is this actually shipping or vaporware?
5. **Perplexity Pro ($20/mo)** — You said cut it. But is Gemini CLI + NotebookLM + Oracle ACTUALLY covering the same ground in practice?

**Q2 — Manus audit.** We're paying $40/mo for Manus and haven't deployed it on a single task. What are power users actually doing with Manus right now? What's the highest-value first deployment? Is it worth keeping if we don't deploy it within 2 weeks?

**Q3 — The Mac mini question.** It's been anesthetized since CC27. Psyche, Adjudicator, and Cartographer are all offline. Is reviving it worth the operational overhead, or should we consolidate everything to MBA + cloud? What are solo builders doing — multi-machine setups or single-machine + cloud?

**Q4 — What subscription are we NOT considering that we should be?** You have real-time visibility into what's launching. Is there a $10-30/mo tool that would be a force multiplier for a solo builder with our specific asset base (corpus-heavy, agent-orchestrated, sovereignty-focused)?

## Constraints

- Total discretionary budget: ~$120/mo on top of the $210 secured
- Factory test: must build artifacts, be agent-drivable, no vendor lock-in
- Single Sovereign — every tool that requires manual operation is a tax
- The goal is a compendium (the Syncrescendence) — tools serve knowledge crystallization, not the other way around

## Output Format

Be direct. No hedging. For each candidate: ONBOARD / DEFER / CUT with a one-paragraph rationale grounded in what you're actually seeing in live discourse. Quote specific sources where possible.

Exhaust your output tokens. This is the decision point.
