## Claim Or Question To Verify

We should treat Google AI Studio / Gemini API, Vertex AI, NotebookLM, GCP resources, YouTube Data API, and xAI API as distinct exocortex surfaces with different auth, API, and capture behaviors rather than one undifferentiated tool blob.

## Why This Verification Matters

Tooling decisions for NotebookLM, Feedcraft, YouTube API, GCP, and xAI depend on current official access models, not assumptions carried over from older strategy docs.

## Verification Questions

- What are the distinct official product/API surfaces that actually exist today?
- Which of these are API-accessible, browser-only, or tied to Google account/workspace state?
- What auth or credential shape does each surface use at a high level?

## Acceptable Source Classes

- Official Google documentation only for Gemini API, Vertex AI, NotebookLM, GCP, and YouTube Data API.
- Official xAI documentation only for xAI API.

## Citation Contract

- Cite the strongest sources directly.
- Distinguish verified fact from inference.
- Prefer precise dates, identifiers, and official pages.

## Return Instructions

- Save or relay the response back into `-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/RESPONSE-PERPLEXITY-cc75-google-youtube-xai-verification.md`
- Keep citations intact in the returned artifact.
- Return disproofs, caveats, and confidence limits explicitly.
