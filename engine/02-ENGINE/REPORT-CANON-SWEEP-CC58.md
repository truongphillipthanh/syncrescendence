# CANON .sn.md Sweep -- CC58

## Summary
- Total files audited: 141
- Correctly placed: 74
- Misplaced (moved): 67
- Duplicates consolidated during moves: 27
- Post-sweep file count: 114
- Remaining cross-topic duplicates: 13 (legitimate)

### Key Finding
40 CANON IDs are duplicated across 2+ corpus folders. The corpus `.sn.md` files are Syncrescript-notation copies of canonical schema nodes (authoritative versions live in `canon/` and `canon/sn/`). Each was distributed into corpus topic folders during atom clustering. Classification below is by SEMANTIC TOPIC of the file's `name` content, not by file type or schema tier.

## Moves Executed

67 files moved to correct semantic folders. 27 duplicates were consolidated (source and destination had identical CANON IDs), reducing total from 141 to 114 files. Cross-folder duplicates reduced from 40 to 13 (remaining are legitimate dual-topic files).

SUBCATEGORY-INDEX.md files updated in 4 folders:
- `ai-capability-futures/SUBCATEGORY-INDEX.md` -- removed 28 CANON refs from Human-AI Symbiosis subcategory
- `ai-models/SUBCATEGORY-INDEX.md` -- removed CANON-33111-BIZ_ENHANCE ref
- `claude-code/SUBCATEGORY-INDEX.md` -- removed CANON-30460, CANON-31130 refs
- `multi-agent-systems/SUBCATEGORY-INDEX.md` -- removed CANON-30460.sn, CANON-25610.sn, CANON-31115 (x2), CANON-31141 (x2), CANON-31142, CANON-31143, CANON-00006, CANON-31120 refs

## Notes

1. **Massive duplication**: 40 CANON IDs appear in 2+ folders. This happened during atom clustering -- schema nodes got distributed alongside the atoms that reference them. The authoritative copies live in `canon/` and `canon/sn/`.

2. **ai-capability-futures was a dumping ground**: 28 CANON files were placed there, most incorrectly. Only CANON-30100 (ASA Model) has a legitimate claim to "AI capability futures." The folder accumulated schema nodes that should live in meaning-civilization, product-business, productivity-pkm, and philosophy-esoterica.

3. **geopolitics-grand-strategy similarly over-accumulated**: 15 CANON files, most of which are structural ontology nodes (Cognitive Palace, Dimensional Coordinators, Lunar Navigation) that belong in meaning-civilization.

4. **Cross-reference duplicates**: Some CANON IDs legitimately appear in 2 folders when the content straddles topics (e.g., Metahumanism in both meaning-civilization and philosophy-esoterica). These were left in place.

5. **No files need to move to `canon/`**: The corpus `.sn.md` files are Syncrescript-notation compressed versions. The authoritative markdown originals already exist in `canon/`. The SN copies serve as corpus-embedded references.
