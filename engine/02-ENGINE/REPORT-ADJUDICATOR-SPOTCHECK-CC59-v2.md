## Overall Accuracy

## Adjudication

Remediation did not work. `multi-agent-systems` is strong after the rebuild, but the other four indexes still contain large volumes of pipeline byproducts, internal task/confirm artifacts, and semantically off-topic material. The dominant failure mode remains constitutional drift: generated artifacts are still being indexed as topic documents, and news roundups or lifestyle essays are still being assigned to overly specific sub-themes.
