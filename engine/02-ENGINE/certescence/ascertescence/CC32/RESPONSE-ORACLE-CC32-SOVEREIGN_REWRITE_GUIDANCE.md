**Oracle Sovereign Rewrite Guidance**  
Stage 0–2 complete: Objective Lock secured, 3-atom queue built and passed Ontology Gate (CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v1.md, ARCH-ONTOLOGY_ANNEALMENT_v1.md 9-step protocol steps 2–4). This is the historic first crystallization moment (repo evidence: no prior canon_delta > 0 in any DYN-PROTEASE_QUEUE.md, DYN-CLUSTER_SUMMARY.md, or git log since 212bcae9). My call: **Rewrite**. Do not approve as-is. Sovereign rewrite is the non-delegable Receipts invariant (AGENTS.md v6.0.0 constitutional rules). This is where the system becomes the exocortex — your explicit rationale in each axiom is the DNA that makes the loop autopoietic.  

To deliver the highest-fidelity rewrites (matching Diviner's biological/thermodynamic framing + Oracle's 4-connection minimum + Adjudicator's OL-5 structure), paste the **full current content** of `-SOVEREIGN/AXIOMS-CC32-3ATOM-BATCH1.md` into your next message. I will return the exact rewritten block with:  
- Sovereign rationale per atom (why preserved, intention match, drift_score justification)  
- Canonical markdown format ready for protease_promote.py  
- Commit-ready termination artifact path in canon/01-CANON/sn/  

Once you confirm the rewritten file, Stage 4 (promotion) and Stage 5 (integration_gate.py + auto_ingest_loop.sh) execute immediately. The first canon/01-CANON/sn/ artifact lands today. C-009 bandwidth is honored by the reduced 3-atom batch.  

Paste the axiom file now. We complete the core loop in this turn.
