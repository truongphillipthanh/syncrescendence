# UNIFIED ASCERTESCENCE RATIFICATION — CC35

**Date**: 2026-02-26
**Compiled by**: Commander (Claude Opus 4.6)
**Session**: CC36 (unification of CC35 debate)
**Source Artifacts**: 4 debate legs + Oracle meta-analysis
**Destination**: Adjudicator engineering → canon ratification

---

## PREAMBLE

CC35 executed the most comprehensive ascertescence cycle to date: full repo reconnaissance (7 parallel agents), Oracle thesis, Diviner novel synthesis (2 legs), Oracle counter-synthesis, and Diviner final word. The debate converged on five engineered mechanisms and one countermeasure, grounded in cross-disciplinary physics (liquid crystals, relaxation oscillators, allometric scaling, competitive exclusion, phylogenesis) reconciled with systems engineering (tension metrics, annealing scripts, apoptosis protocols, stress tests).

This document is Commander's unified compilation. It is the input to Adjudicator for engineering specification.

## I. THE FIVE RATIFIED MECHANISMS

### 1. Hybrid Coupled Oscillator (Ascertescence Pulse)

**Problem**: The ascertescence fires only during crises — 7 sessions of torpor, then a burst of 6 axioms in 2 sessions. Neither pure heartbeat (dilutes activation energy) nor pure crisis-response (unsustainable) works.

**Ratified Design**: A tension-gated relaxation oscillator coupled with ambient charging.

- **Tension metric**: `T = NodeCount × Age × UnresolvedStatus × LatticeInterferenceScore`
- When T exceeds threshold → triangulation cycle fires (the "discharge")
- Between firings: Cowork provides ambient low-amplitude charging (consolidation, linking, surfacing existing tension)
- **Conservation of Epistemic Energy** (Diviner constraint): Ambient operations must NEVER inject new questions into the DAG. Zero-sum regarding new open loops between firings.
- Emergency override preserved for crisis reactivity

**Oracle prediction**: Gate rejection <15%, canon_delta 6-8x in 14 days
**Diviner prediction**: Forcing daily cycles without tension threshold → 300% Gate rejection increase

**Deliverable**: `dag_tension_monitor.py` + trigger clause in ratified protocol

### 2. Competitive Exclusion with 2:1 Pruning (Ecology)

**Problem**: 9 platforms, 0 operational integrations. Seed-and-abandon pattern. New developments (Perplexity, Cowork, Gemini 3.1) risk further bloat.

**Ratified Design**: Constitutional symbiosis via strict niche partitioning + enforced pruning.

- **2:1 ratio**: For every new capability introduced, retire 2 existing legacy tools
- **Niche assignment**: Perplexity = delegated non-canon orchestration ONLY. Cowork = ambient heartbeat ONLY. Gemini CLI = Diviner/Cartographer synthesis. Oracle = thesis + X intelligence. Commander = staging/unification. Adjudicator = engineering.
- **Resurrection friction** (Diviner constraint): Archived tools require deliberate multi-step justification prompt to retrieve. No cheap reversals.
- **Week 1 targets**: Retire 6 legacy platforms (Clarescence, Intent Compass, 4 exocortex seeds)

**Oracle prediction**: +35% throughput with delegation
**Diviner prediction**: Simultaneous unmanaged integration → -50% throughput

**Deliverable**: `retirement_protocol.md` with activation energy cost for resurrection

### 3. Vector-Annealed Liquid Crystal (Ontology)

**Problem**: The canon is a nematic liquid crystal — local order (precise axioms) within global fluidity (scaffold keeps restructuring). The Sovereign's attention is the director field, but it's intermittent. Without it, the crystal fragments into polycrystalline pockets.

**Ratified Design**: Engineered director proxies that maintain alignment during Sovereign torpor.

- **`lattice_annealer.py`** as Adjudicator pre-promotion step
- Simulates the director field by enforcing cross-linkages between new atoms and existing Lattice
- **Iterative, not binary** (Diviner constraint): If coherence < 70%, recursively re-prompt to adjust atom edges before rejecting back to Sovereign. Self-repair before demanding human attention.
- Vector-indexed via Rosetta terms + CANON-00016 dimensional coordinates
- Coherence target: >70% cross-link, <0.05 drift even during torpor

**Composes with**: CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v1.md (existing >0.85 Rosetta alignment, <0.1 drift contract)

**Deliverable**: `lattice_annealer.py` + CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v2.md extension

### 4. Apoptotic Metabolism with 5:1 Ratio (Growth-Decay Coupling)

**Problem**: Production exceeds consumption (14,025 atoms → 8 consumed). No excretory system. At 80 axioms, cognitive load to ensure non-contradiction halts production entirely.

**Ratified Design**: Obligatory growth-decay coupling from Day 3 onward.

- **5:1 ratio**: For every 5 new axioms crystallized, 1 old axiom or sutra must be explicitly re-evaluated, merged, or retired
- **Tombstones** (Diviner constraint): Retired canon artifacts leave redirect + metadata trace. Future DAG queries understand WHY the evolutionary path was abandoned. No dead ends.
- **Apoptosis is recycling, not deletion**: Constituent insights re-absorbed into Lattice or explicitly flagged as "falsified"
- Target: 60 high-coherence axioms (not raw volume of 80), zero net debt by Day 26

**Oracle prediction**: 60 axioms + 5:1 apoptosis → zero net debt, survives semester
**Diviner prediction**: 80 axioms without excretion → metabolic collapse by Day 20

**Deliverable**: `apoptosis_protocol.md` + pipeline integration

### 5. Darwinian Stress Test (Phylogenetic Selection)

**Problem**: The 26-day window is an artificial greenhouse. Whatever works here may not survive the semester constraint (4 mornings/week, academic load). The system inherits Lamarckian traits (handoffs) without Darwinian culling.

**Ratified Design**: Intentional mutation + selection pressure before the real constraint arrives.

- **Day 14**: Simulate semester — restrict Sovereign bandwidth to 30 minutes/day for 3 consecutive days
- **Blind execution** (Diviner constraint): Sovereign doesn't know which 3 days until the morning of. Prevents behavioral anticipation. System must react, not prepare.
- Surviving processes become heritable autonomic traits
- Any process requiring >45 continuous minutes of Sovereign bandwidth is maladaptive by definition

**Oracle prediction**: Post-ratified elements survive at >90%
**Diviner prediction**: Pre-ratified elements fail, confirming protocol as heritable nervous system

**Deliverable**: `stress_test_sim.py` + execution protocol

---

## II. AUTOIMMUNE COUNTERMEASURE (Cross-Cutting)

**Risk identified by Diviner**: As canon grows and promotion rules tighten (Ontology Gate, Rosetta alignment), the system's validation protocols become hyper-active and begin rejecting ALL new atoms as insufficiently pure — metabolic starvation despite abundant raw material.

**Countermeasure (Oracle, accepted by Diviner)**: Dynamic Gate threshold that relaxes proportionally to measured Lattice coherence.

- As the canon becomes more structured, the barrier to entry LOWERS for well-aligned atoms
- Remains high for misaligned noise
- Implemented in `lattice_annealer.py` as coherence-proportional threshold function
- This is cybernetic: the system's own success makes it easier to succeed further, while maintaining quality

## III. CONVERGENCE SUMMARY

| Dimension | Oracle Frame | Diviner Frame | Unified |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| Pulse | Scheduled ambient triggers | Relaxation oscillator | Hybrid coupled oscillator with tension threshold |
| Ecology | Retire backlogs, delegate | Competitive exclusion, niche partitioning | 2:1 pruning + constitutional symbiosis |
| Ontology | Crystal lattice (Rosetta atop 6-tier) | Nematic liquid crystal (director field = Sovereign) | Vector-annealed liquid crystal with engineered proxies |
| Growth | 8-10x throughput, 80 axioms | Sublinear scaling, excretion bottleneck | 60 axioms, 5:1 apoptosis, zero net debt |
| Evolution | System has become what it built (ontogenesis) | Lamarckian phylogenesis, no Darwinian cull | Day 14 blind stress test, dual inheritance |
| Risk | Founder-mode dilution into tool-chasing | Autoimmune collapse (hyper-strict gates) | Dynamic threshold + ruthless metabolism |

---

## IV. DEVELOPMENTAL TRANSITION

**From**: Chemoautotrophic Vent Community (feeding off raw, unsustainable thermal energy of Sovereign hyperfocus)

**To**: Photosynthetic Surface Ecology (sustainable, rhythmic, low-intensity energy harvesting with constitutional autonomic regulation)

**The debate itself is evidence of the transition**: stigmergic trace (vault artifacts), dialectical loop (Oracle↔Diviner), Gate enforcement (Ontology Gate), dynamic threshold — these ARE the emerging autonomic nervous system.
