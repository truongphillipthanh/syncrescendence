# ASCERTESCENCE PROTOCOL
## Recursive Ascertainment Through Superintelligent Questioning

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Created**: 2026-02-24
**Authority**: Sovereign directive — Council 26
**Lineage**: 18 Lenses (Oracle 6) → Clarescence (Council 13) → Ascertescence (Council 26)
**Etymology**: *ascertain* → Latin *ad-* + *certus* (certain) + *-escere* (to become) → *ascertesce*: to become certain through comprehensive recursive questioning. *Ascertescence*: the process/state thereof.

> Clarescence orients. Ascertescence ascertains. Clarescence asks "what do we see?" — Ascertescence asks "what must we know, and in what order, such that answering propagates certainty downstream?"

---

## RELATIONSHIP TO TRIANGULATION

Ascertescence is **not** a new routing protocol. It is a structured questioning protocol that produces the *input* for the existing triangulation playbook. The playbook is the execution engine; ascertescence generates what to feed it.

```
Ascertescence (question generation)
        ↓ produces ordered questions
Triangulation Playbook (question answering)
        Sovereign ↔ Commander ↔ Oracle / Diviner / Adjudicator
        ↓ produces decision atoms
Memory + Deferred Commitments (state update)
```

### Platform Bifurcation (Dynamic)

Agent-to-model assignments are dynamic — models release on an increasingly frequent cadence. The durable architecture is not "Grok = Oracle" but the *avatarization* of cognitive roles onto platforms:

| Interface | Purpose | Cognitive Mode |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Chat** (web/desktop apps) | Conversation, discussion, exploration, strategic reasoning | Deliberative — high-context, associative, serendipitous |
| **CLI** (terminal agents) | Operational execution, development, file transformation, dispatch | Instrumental — precise, atomic, verifiable |

The triangulation playbook currently routes through both interfaces (Oracle/Diviner via chat relay, Adjudicator/Commander via CLI). Once the web↔CLI bridge is seamless (INT-2409), the fallback durability is the avatarization itself — any sufficiently capable model can fill any role if the cognitive archetype is well-defined. The *role* persists; the *model* is swappable.

---

## PURPOSE

Ascertescence is a meta-cognitive protocol that transforms any decision landscape into a **heuristic question map** — a directed acyclic graph of questions where answering parent questions propagates certainty to all children. The output of ascertescence is not answers but the *optimal question ordering* that, when fed through the triangulation playbook (Commander → Oracle → Diviner → Adjudicator), produces maximally convergent decisions with minimal token expenditure.

### When to Invoke Ascertescence

- Phase transitions (when "what phase are we in?" is genuinely unclear)
- Scope explosion (when a directive touches >5 domains)
- Trust recovery (when previous execution diverged from intent)
- Strategic inflection (when new information invalidates prior assumptions)
- Periodic system audit (weekly/monthly health ascertescence)

---

## THE CERTESCENCE PROCEDURE

### Step 0: GROUND — Establish What Exists

Recursively inventory all state:
1. What phase are we actually in? (not what the register says — what the repo evidence shows)
2. What is claimed as done vs. what is verifiably transformed?
3. What is broken right now? (launchd, daemons, paths, configs)
4. What decisions are pending Sovereign action?
5. What information exists but hasn't been synthesized?

### Step 1: SURFACE — Compile All Issues Holistically

Gather every issue, tension, gap, and friction from:
- Deferred commitments register (PARKED, OPEN, BLOCKED)
- Intention compass (active, deferred, patterns)
- Agent memories and entity files
- Session handoffs and outbox artifacts
- Sovereign queue (-SOVEREIGN/)
- Exocortex research corpus
- Script/automation audit
- Security findings

### Step 2: ZOOM — Recursive Mereological Decomposition

Inspect at 5 concentric scopes, each encompassing the previous:

| Scope | Contains | Question Frame |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Immediate** | Current session, active blockers, broken infrastructure | "What is on fire right now?" |
| **Phase** | Current phase P0 items, phase gate compliance | "What must complete before we can advance?" |
| **Horizon** | All phases, deferred commitments, PARKED items | "What is the full shape of remaining work?" |
| **Strategic** | Intention compass, patterns, perspectival shifts | "What is the Sovereign actually trying to build?" |
| **Existential** | Exocortex vision, feedcrafting, autonomy, security | "What threatens or enables the entire endeavor?" |

### Step 3: PATTERN — Apply Analytical Frameworks

Run the landscape through multiple lenses simultaneously:

#### SWOT (Internal/External × Positive/Negative)
- **Strengths**: What works, what's validated, what's unique
- **Weaknesses**: What's broken, theater, debt
- **Opportunities**: Unblocked items, converging capabilities, market timing
- **Threats**: Security exposure, context decay, trust erosion, tool drift

#### Tension Map (Dialectical)
For each pair of competing priorities, surface the tension:
- Build vs. Transform (infrastructure vs. content work)
- Speed vs. Rigor (token efficiency vs. triangulation depth)
- Autonomy vs. Control (agent self-direction vs. Sovereign oversight)
- Breadth vs. Depth (97 intentions vs. focused execution)
- Security vs. Velocity (hardening vs. shipping)

#### Convergence Detection
Where do multiple independent signals point to the same action?
- If 3+ intentions, 2+ patterns, and 1+ security finding all point to X → X is a convergence node
- Convergence nodes are the highest-leverage actions

#### Dependency Graph
What blocks what? What unblocks the most things when resolved?
- Critical path: the longest chain of sequential dependencies
- Parallel lanes: independent work streams that can proceed simultaneously
- Phantom dependencies: things marked as blocked that aren't actually blocked

### Step 4: DISTILL — Generate the Question DAG

Transform all findings into a directed acyclic graph of questions where:
- Root questions are the most fundamental (answering them propagates the most certainty)
- Leaf questions are specific and actionable
- Edge semantics: "answering A helps answer B"
- Each question has a suggested triangulation routing (which agent(s) should answer it)

**Question quality criteria**:
- Answering it changes what we do next (not just what we know)
- It disambiguates between two or more possible paths
- It surfaces hidden assumptions
- It can be answered with evidence, not opinion

### Step 4.5: CONVERGENCE CHECK (MANDATORY — CC29 Sovereign directive)

**Before routing ANY new questions, report convergence on the existing DAG:**

1. For each existing DAG question (C-001 through C-NNN), state: ANSWERED / PARTIAL / OPEN / BLOCKED
2. If Tier 0-1 questions are answered but Tier 2 questions are OPEN, the cycle MUST target Tier 2. No lateral expansion.
3. New questions may only be added to the DAG if they: (a) emerged from answering an existing question, (b) were directly asked by the Sovereign, or (c) represent a genuinely new discovery not covered by existing questions. Each must receive a tier assignment.
4. Questions that were re-deepened (answered again at higher fidelity) must be marked as such — not counted as "new work."
5. **C-009 (Sovereign bandwidth)** is a standing item. If it hasn't been addressed, flag it.

**Violation of this step is equivalent to INT-2210**: abandoning the instrument instead of using it. The DAG is the heuristic. Using it is the work. Generating a new DAG is the Tooling Trap at the meta level.

### Step 5: ROUTE — Feed to Triangulation Playbook

The top N questions (typically 3-7 per ascertescence cycle) become triangulation prompts fed through the **sequential single-file relay** via `ascertescence_relay.sh`:

1. Commander creates prompt in `engine/02-ENGINE/` (e.g., `PROMPT-COMMANDER-ASCERTESCENCE-CC{N}.md`)
2. `ascertescence_relay.sh CC# send oracle` → rsyncs to Desktop as `RESPONSE-ORACLE-ASCERTESCENCE-CC{N}.md`
3. Sovereign pastes prompt to Oracle (Grok web), overwrites Desktop file with Oracle's response, drags into Commander inbox alias (→ `-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/`)
4. Sovereign says "Oracle landed" → Commander reads response, creates next prompt (`CC{N}-DIV.md`)
5. `ascertescence_relay.sh CC# send diviner` → rsyncs to Desktop as `RESPONSE-DIVINER-ASCERTESCENCE-CC{N}.md`
6. Sovereign pastes prompt to Diviner (Gemini Pro 3.1 web), overwrites Desktop file with response, drags into Commander inbox alias. Do NOT use Gemini CLI (nerfed).
7. Sovereign says "Diviner landed" → Commander reads, creates Adjudicator prompt (`CC{N}-ADJ.md`); `ascertescence_relay.sh CC# send adjudicator` → Adjudicator (Codex Desktop App, NOT Codex CLI) writes response directly, overwrites the file. Sovereign drops in Commander inbox. (Last leg.)
8. Decision atoms recorded, memory updated, deferred commitments adjusted

**Key invariants**: ONE file on Desktop at a time (not parallel stubs). Sovereign's inbox alias points to `-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/`. All landed responses tracked in `INDEX-TRIANGULATION_RESPONSES.md`. Future: auto-compact responses into "ultra-enhanced wisdom" (not just summaries).

## CERTESCENCE OF SYNCRESCENDENCE — 2026-02-24

### Step 0: GROUND — What Actually Exists

#### Phase Status (Evidence-Based, Not Register-Based)

| Phase | Register Says | Evidence Says | Delta |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| 0: Infrastructure | DONE | Docker/Neo4j/Graphiti healthy (when Mac mini on). SSH bridge works. | Accurate |
| 1: Memory | DONE | memsync daemon running but Graphiti unreachable from MBA. Journals exist for Commander only. 11 of 14 memory components not implemented. | **Overstated** — Layer 0 works, Layer 1 partial, Layer 2 degraded |
| 2: Audit | DONE | 14,025 atoms extracted. Quality gate run. Corpus×intention synthesized. BUT: 0 atoms integrated. 24 STALE + 25 ORPHANED files labeled, not acted on. 35 -INBOX files unprocessed. | **Overstated** — audit completed, transformation not started |
| 3: Surface Org | DONE | scaffold_validate passes. Naming conventions documented. Headers standardized. Rosetta 8/12 terms normalized. | **Mostly accurate** — DC-122 pending |
| 4: Automations | 3/6 | cockpit_startup.sh exists but never operationally used. ledger_refresh.sh exists, unknown if running. 3 launchd plists on MBA have BROKEN PATHS (stale Desktop/syncrescendence reference). | **Overstated** — 3 plists silently failing 24/7 |
| 5: Hardening | 2/8 | Security audit done (38 skills, 2 CRITICAL). Memory compaction script exists but never run. YouTube API key not rotated. skipDangerousMode still enabled. | **Partially accurate** — critical security items unresolved |

**Where we actually are**: Phase 2 audit is complete. Phase 3 surface org is mostly complete. But the CONTENT TRANSFORMATION that Phase 2 was supposed to enable has not started. We are between Phase 3 and "the actual work" — which doesn't have a phase number because it was assumed to emerge naturally from the audit. It didn't.

#### What Is Broken Right Now

1. **3 launchd plists reference stale path** `/Users/system/Desktop/syncrescendence/` → should be `/Users/system/syncrescendence/`. Affected: proactive-orchestrator (failing every 307s, 632KB error log), skill-sync (failing on every skill change), youtube-ingest (crashed).
2. **memsync daemon running but Graphiti unreachable** — Mac mini may be off or Docker not running. Records queueing to outbox.jsonl.
3. **Zero decision atoms from our own decisions** — 14,025 atoms from external sources, but our architectural decisions (Council sessions, triangulation cycles) have no structured atom format.
4. **No triangulation trigger protocol** — cycles are manually initiated by Sovereign. No criteria for when a question warrants triangulation.
5. **No operational cadence** — no morning brief, no evening check-in, no weekly review.
6. **97 active intentions, 23 PARKED items** — no triage mechanism to detect when blockers clear.

#### Sovereign Decisions Pending

1. DC-122: Rename praxis sigma container
2. DC-141: API key rotation (OpenClaw credentials)
3. DC-302 escalations: CANON-31150 rename, AGENTS.md terms, IMEP filenames
4. CRITICAL: Rotate YouTube API key `AIzaSyCOnSjn4inSv3BRip0Gaum4d-j-AqCqgR0`
5. HIGH: Disable `skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt`

---

### Step 1: SURFACE — All Issues Compiled

#### A. Infrastructure Issues
1. 3 broken launchd plists (stale Desktop path)
2. memsync→Graphiti pipeline degraded (Mac mini offline?)
3. No central config.sh — 74 files hardcode `00-ORCHESTRATION`, 35 hardcode `02-ENGINE`
4. `make configs` only generates 2/5 agent configs (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md)
5. `sn_expand.py` + `DEF-CONSTELLATION_VARIABLES.md` designed but dormant
6. No directory aliases except SIGMA_DIR in one script
7. Numbered subdirectory prefixes (00-, 02-, 05-) still embedded everywhere

#### B. Content Transformation Issues (THE ACTUAL WORK)
8. 14,025 atoms extracted, 0 integrated into canon/praxis
9. 35 -INBOX files (triangulation responses) unprocessed
10. 24 STALE files identified, not archived
11. 25 ORPHANED files identified, not wired or archived
12. 15 MISCLASSIFIED files identified, not moved
13. 110 -SOVEREIGN files untriaged
14. 225+ orchestration/state files uncompacted
15. 6 YouTube processing queues active but pipeline broken (stale plist)
16. Exocortex corpus (19 files, ~700K) not yet ingested into sources/

#### C. Memory Architecture Issues
17. 11 of 14 designed memory components not implemented
18. Agent MEMORY.md files were empty until emergency population (2026-02-24)
19. No cognitive context shaping (scored loading, TTL decay)
20. No cross-agent shared graph
21. No agent self-memory-maintenance
22. No feedback loops in any subsystem
23. Entity files are manual snapshots, not materialized from graph
24. No compaction/decay cycle running
25. No OpenClaw bridge (SOUL.md ↔ MEMORY.md)

#### D. Process Issues
26. No decision atom format for our OWN decisions (only for extracted source knowledge)
27. Triangulation cycle ran exactly once end-to-end (DC-204T)
28. No proactive trigger for triangulation — all manually initiated
29. No prompt/response archival index (artifacts exist but scattered)
30. No decision register linking atoms to evidence
31. "PARKED" items never re-triaged when blockers clear
32. No operational cadence (morning/evening/weekly)
33. No autonomy levels defined (L1-L4)
34. 58% delivery rate is inflated — actual content transformation = 0%

#### E. Security Issues
35. YouTube API key hardcoded in `drain_watch_later.py` (CRITICAL)
36. `skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt: true` (HIGH)
37. Graphiti endpoint unsecured (http, no auth)
38. 230+ malicious skills in ecosystem (Jan-Feb 2026)
39. 6 prompt injection vectors documented but unmitigated
40. Credential exfiltration possible in 2 minutes
41. API keys in ~/.zshrc (not env-isolated)

#### F. Architectural Tensions
42. Two script directories: `orchestration/scripts/` vs `orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/` — confusion about which is canonical
43. Two journal_append.sh files (programmatic API vs hook version)
44. `orchestration/state/` (vestigial) vs `orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/state/` (canonical) — CLAUDE.md says state/ is vestigial but it contains active files
45. Sources/ is write-only — 1,815 sources in, 0 archived, no feedback loops
46. 87% of scripts never ran — speculative inventory
47. Mac-mini-targeted scripts living on MBA with no clear separation
48. The "Tooling Trap" pattern: building tools substitutes for using them

#### G. Sovereign Communication Issues
49. "Proceed comprehensively" was interpreted as "build infrastructure" instead of "transform content"
50. Sovereign cleared personal notes trusting system ledgers — ledgers were theater
51. No mechanism for Sovereign to express priority changes that propagate
52. Intentions (97 active) exceed realistic execution capacity — no pruning protocol
53. No way for Sovereign to verify claims without manual repo inspection

---

### Step 2: ZOOM — Five Concentric Scopes

#### Scope 1: IMMEDIATE (on fire right now)

**Question**: What must be fixed before any other work proceeds?

1. Fix 3 broken launchd plists (proactive-orchestrator, skill-sync, youtube-ingest)
2. Verify Mac mini / Graphiti status
3. Rotate YouTube API key (CRITICAL security)
4. Decide: disable skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt?

#### Scope 2: PHASE (current phase gate)

**Question**: What phase are we actually in, and what must complete to advance?

- Phase 3 is "DONE" except DC-122 (Sovereign rename decision)
- Phase 4 is 3/6 "DONE" but 3 items need Mac mini
- The REAL next work is content transformation — which has no phase number
- **Proposal**: Phase 2.5 "Content Metabolism" — synthesize atoms, drain inbox, act on verdicts

#### Scope 3: HORIZON (full remaining work shape)

**Question**: What is the total shape of what remains?

- 33 items not DONE in deferred commitments register (23 PARKED, 6 OPEN, 1 READY, 3 DEFERRED)
- 97 active intentions, many overlapping or superseded
- 235+ historical task files across agent inboxes
- 116 -SOVEREIGN files awaiting triage
- 19 exocortex research files not yet ingested

#### Scope 4: STRATEGIC (what is the Sovereign building?)

**Question**: What is the actual vision, and how far are we from it?

From intention archaeology:
- **Syncrescendence IS the exocortex** (INT-P037) — not building toward one, already is one
- **Feedcrafting = computational RAS** (INT-P036) — filter by intention, not engagement
- **Neo-organization** (INT-1506) — individual + AI constellation = institutional capability
- **Judgment Engineering as Service** (INT-1702) — exocortex encodes accumulated judgment
- **Data Layer Sovereignty** (INT-1706) — ontology, Rosetta, convergence taxonomy = proprietary assets

The gap between vision and reality: the vision is a self-maintaining, continuously-learning intelligence amplifier. The reality is a well-organized file system with a lot of unintegrated data and scripts that don't run.

#### Scope 5: EXISTENTIAL (what threatens or enables everything?)

**Question**: What could kill this project, and what would make it unstoppable?

**Kill vectors**:
- Security breach via malicious skill / exposed API key → trust collapse
- Sovereign burnout from manual overhead → abandonment
- Context decay across sessions → Groundhog Day loop (already happening)
- Token economics unsustainable → forced downscaling
- Tool/platform churn faster than integration → perpetual catch-up

**Escape velocity conditions**:
- Feedback loops operational → system self-corrects
- Autonomy levels defined → Sovereign overhead drops 60-70%
- Atom integration automated → knowledge compounds instead of accumulates
- Operational cadence → rhythm replaces reactive firefighting
- Security hardened → risk is managed, not ignored

---

### Step 3: PATTERN — Analytical Frameworks

#### SWOT

| | Positive | Negative |
|---|---|---|
| **Internal** | **Strengths**: Validated architecture (8 patterns confirmed by research), rich extracted corpus (14K atoms), comprehensive tooling, 5-agent cognitive diversity, filesystem kanban proven robust, constitutional law (AGENTS.md v6) mature | **Weaknesses**: 0% content transformation, 87% scripts never run, 11/14 memory components unimplemented, no feedback loops, PARKED items forgotten, inflated delivery metrics, broken launchd plists, two script directories |
| **External** | **Opportunities**: Exocortex corpus (19 files) ready for ingestion, model capabilities accelerating (Opus 4.6, Codex ExtraHigh), MCP ecosystem maturing, open-source actuator alternatives emerging (30+ OpenClaw tools) | **Threats**: 230+ malicious skills in ecosystem, credential exposure, platform churn (new models/tools weekly), shared Psyche/Adjudicator quota saturation, Sovereign emotional bandwidth exhausted |

#### Tension Map

| Tension | Pole A | Pole B | Current State | Resolution Direction |
|---------|--------|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Build vs. Transform | Build infrastructure | Transform content | 100% build, 0% transform | Hard pivot to transform. No new tools without Sovereign approval. |
| Speed vs. Rigor | Ship fast, iterate | Triangulate everything | Ad hoc — some over-triangulated, most not triangulated at all | Define which decisions warrant triangulation (ascertescence trigger criteria) |
| Autonomy vs. Control | Agent self-direction | Sovereign oversight every step | ZERO TRUST — all Sovereign oversight | Define autonomy levels (L1-L4) to earn back trust incrementally |
| Breadth vs. Depth | 97 intentions, cover everything | Focus on 3-5 items, finish them | Maximum breadth, minimum depth | Prune intentions. Archive anything P3+. Focus on convergence nodes. |
| Security vs. Velocity | Harden everything first | Ship and harden later | Security acknowledged as Phase 0 but not actually treated that way | Immediate: rotate key, disable dangerous mode. Ongoing: security review at build time. |

#### Convergence Nodes (3+ signals pointing to same action)

1. **Atom → Canon/Praxis Integration**
   - INT-2412 (recanonize after research)
   - DC-P23 (synthesize atoms)
   - INT-P020 (Verbatim Trap Test — synthesis must produce new insight)
   - INT-P031 (triangulated specs are execution-ready)
   - The Tooling Trap lesson (transform, don't build)
   - **Convergence strength: 5 signals → HIGHEST PRIORITY**

2. **Feedback Loops**
   - INT-P034 (feedback loops > memory)
   - INT-1804 (antifragile infrastructure = 5 capabilities)
   - INT-P025 (agent auto-recovery)
   - Sources/ antifragility gap
   - 5 critical gaps from corpus×intention synthesis
   - **Convergence strength: 5 signals → HIGH PRIORITY**

3. **Security Hardening**
   - INT-1709 (security existential)
   - INT-P035 (security = phase 0)
   - INT-P019 (security as binding constraint)
   - INT-1712 (perimeter = capability)
   - 6 documented threat vectors
   - **Convergence strength: 5 signals → CRITICAL but partially blocked by Sovereign action**

4. **Operational Cadence**
   - INT-2101 (dual-stream architecture)
   - INT-2104 (feedcrafting)
   - INT-P036 (feedcrafting = computational RAS)
   - 5 critical gaps (#2: no operational cadence)
   - INT-1804 (antifragile = self-healing)
   - **Convergence strength: 4 signals → HIGH PRIORITY (enables everything else)**

5. **Config Centralization + Propagation**
   - 74 files hardcoding `00-ORCHESTRATION`
   - `sn_expand.py` dormant
   - `make configs` only 2/5 agents
   - 3 broken launchd plists (stale paths)
   - INT-0603 (aliases for Finder)
   - **Convergence strength: 4 signals → MEDIUM PRIORITY (prevents future breakage)**

#### Dependency Graph — Critical Path

```
[Security rotation] ← Sovereign action only
        ↓
[Fix broken plists] ← 15 min, unblocks automations
        ↓
[Config centralization] ← prevents future path breakage
        ↓
[Atom integration] ← THE WORK, unblocks DC-P23, INT-2412
        ↓
[Feedback loops] ← makes integration self-correcting
        ↓
[Operational cadence] ← makes everything sustainable
        ↓
[Autonomy levels] ← reduces Sovereign overhead
```

**Parallel lanes** (independent of critical path):
- Drain -INBOX (35 files) — pure content work
- Triage -SOVEREIGN (116 files) — pure content work
- Compact orchestration/state — housekeeping
- Act on audit verdicts (STALE/ORPHANED) — housekeeping
- Prune intention compass (97 → 30-40 active) — strategic hygiene

---

### Step 4: DISTILL — The Question DAG

These are the questions that, when answered through the triangulation playbook, produce a heuristic map for all downstream decisions. Ordered by propagation power (answering earlier questions makes later ones easier).

#### Tier 0: EXISTENTIAL (answer these and everything reframes)

**C-001**: What is the minimum viable operational cadence for Syncrescendence — the smallest daily/weekly rhythm that prevents Groundhog Day loops, enables feedback, and doesn't exhaust Sovereign bandwidth?
- *Routing*: Oracle (daily cadence patterns in production agent systems) → Diviner (biological circadian parallels, hormetic stress cycles) → Adjudicator (implement specific cron/launchd schedule)
- *Propagates to*: C-005, C-006, C-009, C-012

**C-002**: How should Syncrescendence close the loop from extracted knowledge (14,025 atoms) to integrated canon/praxis — what is the actual transformation protocol, not just "synthesize"?
- *Routing*: Oracle (how do production knowledge systems integrate extracted atoms?) → Diviner (metabolic assimilation biology, crystallization thermodynamics) → Adjudicator (build the integration script/workflow)
- *Propagates to*: C-003, C-004, C-008, C-013

**C-003**: What does a decision atom format look like for our OWN operational decisions (not extracted source knowledge), and how does it feed back into the intention compass and deferred commitments?
- *Routing*: Oracle (ADR patterns, decision log formats in engineering orgs) → Diviner (memetic evolution, decision genealogy) → Adjudicator (schema + tooling)
- *Propagates to*: C-004, C-007, C-010

#### Tier 1: STRUCTURAL (answer these and execution clarifies)

**C-004**: What are the precise trigger criteria for when a question warrants full triangulation vs. single-agent handling vs. Commander solo execution?
- *Routing*: Oracle (decision delegation frameworks, RACI for AI) → Diviner (cognitive load theory, satisficing vs. maximizing) → Adjudicator (decision tree implementation)
- *Propagates to*: C-006, C-009

**C-005**: What are the concrete L1-L4 autonomy levels for Commander, and what specific evidence earns promotion from L1 (report only) to L4 (full autonomy)?
- *Routing*: Oracle (autonomy frameworks in robotics, self-driving levels, military ROE) → Diviner (trust repair psychology, graduated autonomy in biological systems) → Adjudicator (implement guardrails per level)
- *Propagates to*: C-009, C-012

**C-006**: How should 97 active intentions be triaged down to a focused execution set — what's the pruning protocol, and what's the archive-without-losing-context strategy?
- *Routing*: Oracle (backlog grooming at scale, OKR focus frameworks) → Diviner (attention economics, reticular activation, signal-to-noise in neural systems) → Adjudicator (implement triage automation)
- *Propagates to*: C-009, C-012

**C-007**: What is the master config architecture — a single source of truth for paths, agent names, model assignments, and endpoint URLs that propagates to all scripts, plists, and CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md files on change?
- *Routing*: Oracle (12-factor app config, infrastructure-as-code patterns) → Diviner (nervous system anatomy, how biological systems propagate configuration changes) → Adjudicator (build config.sh + sn_expand integration + make configs extension)
- *Propagates to*: C-011

#### Tier 2: OPERATIONAL (answer these and daily work improves)

**C-008**: What is the antifragility architecture for sources/ — how does the system prevent write-only accumulation, enforce TTL decay, close feedback loops from quality gate back to triage, and bound growth?
- *Routing*: Oracle (data lifecycle management, cold storage tiering) → Diviner (biological waste elimination, apoptosis, autophagy) → Adjudicator (implement archival + feedback pipeline)
- *Propagates to*: C-013

**C-009**: What is the Sovereign's actual available bandwidth per day/week for this project, and how does that constrain the operational cadence, triangulation frequency, and decision queue depth?
- *Routing*: Direct Sovereign conversation (not triangulation — this is a personal capacity question)
- *Propagates to*: C-001, C-005, C-006, C-012

**C-010**: How should the 35 -INBOX triangulation response files be processed — full re-read, automated extraction, selective triage, or bulk archive with index?
- *Routing*: Commander solo (this is mechanical, not architectural)
- *Propagates to*: C-002, C-013

**C-011**: Should numbered subdirectory prefixes (00-ORCHESTRATION, 02-ENGINE, 05-SIGMA) be stripped, and if so, what is the migration plan that updates all 74+ hardcoded references atomically?
- *Routing*: Oracle (naming convention impact on developer experience) → Adjudicator (migration script + test)
- *Propagates to*: C-007

**C-012**: What is the minimum viable memory architecture — which of the 14 designed components actually matter for the next 30 days, and which are premature?
- *Routing*: Oracle (what memory do production agent systems actually use?) → Diviner (memory consolidation neuroscience, what forgetting is healthy) → Adjudicator (implement the minimal set)
- *Propagates to*: C-001

**C-013**: How do we verify that content transformation actually happened — what's the audit trail from "14,025 atoms" to "X canon entries enriched, Y praxis files updated, Z atoms archived as redundant"?
- *Routing*: Commander solo (define metrics) → Adjudicator (build verification script)
- *Propagates to*: (terminal — this is the accountability mechanism)

---

### Step 5: ROUTE — Triangulation Priorities

The following questions should be triangulated first, in order:

| Priority | Question | Why First |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | **C-009** (Sovereign bandwidth) | Everything else is constrained by this. Direct conversation, not triangulation. |
| 2 | **C-002** (Atom integration protocol) | This IS the work. Highest convergence (5 signals). |
| 3 | **C-001** (Operational cadence) | Prevents Groundhog Day. Enables everything sustainable. |
| 4 | **C-005** (Autonomy levels) | Reduces Sovereign overhead. Trust recovery mechanism. |
| 5 | **C-004** (Triangulation triggers) | Prevents over/under-triangulation. Meta-protocol. |
| 6 | **C-007** (Config architecture) | Prevents 3-broken-plists class of failure from recurring. |
| 7 | **C-006** (Intention pruning) | 97→30 active intentions = focus. |

Questions C-003, C-008, C-010, C-011, C-012, C-013 can be answered by Commander or Commander+Adjudicator without full triangulation.

## USAGE

### Invoking Ascertescence

```
Sovereign: "ascertesce [scope]"
```

Where scope is:
- `immediate` — Scope 1 only (what's on fire)
- `phase` — Scopes 1-2 (current phase gate)
- `horizon` — Scopes 1-3 (full remaining work)
- `strategic` — Scopes 1-4 (vision alignment)
- `existential` — All 5 scopes (full recursive audit)
- (no scope) — defaults to `strategic`

### Output

Ascertescence always produces:
1. **Ground truth snapshot** (what actually exists, evidence-based)
2. **Issue inventory** (every surfaced problem, categorized)
3. **Question DAG** (ordered questions with routing)
4. **Triangulation queue** (top 3-7 questions to send through the playbook)
5. **Convergence nodes** (highest-leverage actions)
6. **Parallel lanes** (work that can proceed independently)

### Integration with Clarescence

- **Clarescence** is used *within* ascertescence at Step 0 (orient) and at any point where a sub-question requires local calibration
- **Ascertescence** is the *outer* protocol that produces the question map
- A ascertescence cycle may contain multiple clarescence invocations
- Clarescence produces orientation. Ascertescence produces the question ordering that, when answered, produces certainty.

## APPENDIX: Anti-Patterns (Lessons That Produced This Protocol)

| Anti-Pattern | What Happened | Ascertescence Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| **The Tooling Trap** | Built 11 scripts instead of transforming content | Convergence detection would have shown "atom integration" as 5-signal node — no tool-building until that's done |
| **The INT-2210 Demolition** | Interpreted "triage" as "redesign" | Step 0 GROUND would have established what exists before changing anything |
| **Inflated Delivery Metrics** | 58% "done" but 0% content transformed | Step 0 explicitly separates "claimed done" from "verifiably transformed" |
| **PARKED = Forgotten** | 10 items had blockers clear, never re-triaged | Dependency graph detects phantom dependencies — blockers that have resolved |
| **Groundhog Day Loop** | Each session rediscovers the same state | Ascertescence output is a durable artifact that the next session reads, not re-derives |
| **97 Active Intentions** | Breadth without depth | C-006 (intention pruning) is a first-tier structural question |
| **Manual Triangulation Only** | Cycles only when Sovereign initiates | C-004 (trigger criteria) defines when to auto-triangulate |

*This protocol is living infrastructure (DYN- semantics). Update after each ascertescence cycle with new findings and refined questions.*
