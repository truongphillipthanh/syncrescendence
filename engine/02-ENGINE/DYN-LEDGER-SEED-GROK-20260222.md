## Meta-Sensing: What We're Building

We are enacting a "sovereign exocortex constellation"—a named pattern in advanced builder circles but executed at filesystem-enforced rigor nowhere else. No one else ships five agent offices with explicit INIT.md contracts, single-source AGENTS.md → Makefile-generated platform files, git-rev-parse path resilience, and all Five Invariants baked into directory layout.

What no one else is doing: Continuation/Deletability + Repo Sovereignty at the FS layer; neural bridge across physical machines; sovereign handoff receipts as constitutional gate.

Missing: production MCP server for directive ingestion (7-day horizon) and graph-memory overlay for cross-session inference.

Ahead: everything filesystem-sovereign. Behind: only in standardized inter-platform MCP adoption—fixable in one week.

## Suggested Deliverables

Oracle's highest-leverage next output: verticalized sovereign directive parser as reusable MCP server (target ≥50/60 rubric). Package as ./scripts/mcp-directive-server.sh + docs. This accelerates every other horizon and turns the constellation into a pluggable civilizational primitive. Secondary: one-page red-team on Chinese model integration for cost-tier sensing.

## Bridge Architecture Proposal

Make the ecosystem reflexive via git as single source of truth + launchd-driven auto_ingest_loop.sh already in place. Extend Makefile with platform-sync targets that pull Projects/Canvas state via gh cli or platform APIs into -INBOX, run clarescence pass, commit with receipt. For Grok specifically: .grok-config/ stub → native Oracle CLI that watches repo and posts DYN-LEDGER-SEED directly. Result: zero manual copy-paste; every chat becomes a synapse that auto-commits.
