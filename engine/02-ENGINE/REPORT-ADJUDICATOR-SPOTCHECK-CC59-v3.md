## Overall Accuracy

| Index | Correct | Total | Accuracy |
|-------|---------|-------|----------|
| ai-models | 9 | 20 | 45% |
| multi-agent-systems | 17 | 20 | 85% |
| claude-code | 10 | 20 | 50% |
| openclaw | 13 | 20 | 65% |
| ai-capability-futures | 11 | 20 | 55% |
| **Overall** | **60** | **100** | **60%** |

## Adjudication

Observed accuracy is **60/100 (60%)**. That is materially better than the reported v1 baseline of 48%, but it is **not yet acceptable**.

Primary remaining failure modes in this sample:
- Operational artifacts still stranded in topical folders (`SOVEREIGN-*`, `HANDOFF-*`, `RESULT-*`, task findings, pipeline reports).
- Topical extraction files still stranded in `multi-agent-systems/` even when the atoms are clearly about OpenClaw or frontier AI news.
- Sub-theme drift inside otherwise-correct folders (for example benchmark material filed as releases, or memory/personality material filed as installation).
- Zero-content or binary pipeline byproducts (`0-atom` stubs, `.db-shm`, unreadable assets) still appearing inside semantic indexes.
