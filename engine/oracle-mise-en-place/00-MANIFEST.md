# Oracle Mise en Place — Curated Corpus Slice

**Purpose**: These 15 files are the densest possible representation of what the Syncrescendence IS, WHERE it's going, and WHAT it's building. Read them to understand the project deeply enough to stress-test every strategic framing.

**How to read**: Start with the manifest below, then read files in the order listed. Each file has a role. Skip nothing.

## TOTAL: 15 files, ~10,300 lines

This is approximately 50K tokens. Combined with the Oracle prompt (~4K tokens) and the strategy brief (attached by Sovereign), Oracle has rich context for deep strategic sensing.
