Hello community. So great that you are
0:03
back. Let's do a gdunking experiment.
0:05
Let's just think about AI, where it
0:08
started and how it will end. A simple
0:11
video. So welcome to discover. But this
0:14
will be a totally different video. This
0:17
will just be some crazy ideas. There's
0:19
nothing about science. Okay, maybe a
0:21
little bit of science, but this is an
0:23
out of the ordinary video. If you don't
0:26
watch it, never mind. You don't lose
0:28
anything. just some crazy thoughts of
0:30
mine.
0:32
Now sometimes I think where did it all
0:34
began with AI and you know I think there
0:37
was really here the first disruption
0:38
when we started to understand this chain
0:41
of sword prompting idea. No and we asked
0:44
an AI and we said hey break down a
0:46
problem into a series of intermediate
0:47
sequential reasoning step and this led
0:49
the AI model to a better formulation a
0:53
better reasoning if we just said hey do
0:57
this and nothing else.
1:00
Now imagine me now sitting here in an
1:03
empty classroom. I am now an LLM, not an
1:06
agent yet. And I have just here nothing.
1:09
I just have here my brain, whatever I
1:12
learned up to this very moment. And I
1:14
just have a linear sequence in the
1:17
complexity of creating my thoughts, my
1:20
learning, experiencing here my immediate
1:24
epsilon environment. This is it. So my
1:27
reasoning complexity if you want is
1:29
limited here to a linear sequence of
1:31
sort and this is this beautiful line
1:34
indicating here a linear sequence and
1:37
then about 2022 we had a leap to the
1:40
action. Now we had a react framework now
1:43
emerging for AI and the react framework
1:46
had three main points. Now to reason
1:50
formulate a sort about what it needs to
1:52
do next then to act. So really execute
1:55
an action here go to a database search
1:58
the internet and then observe the result
2:01
analyze the result and integrate it.
2:04
So what happened now? I'm now still
2:07
sitting in an empty classroom. But now I
2:09
have internet connectivity. So now I can
2:12
connect to external data but I don't
2:15
know if I can trust those external data
2:17
because I have here also internal data
2:19
what I learned from my parents from
2:21
school from my local environments. So
2:24
now something interesting is going to
2:26
happen. What is happening in an AI
2:29
model? If any model would be sitting
2:31
here is now that we have internet
2:33
access, we have agentic features, we
2:36
have memory.
2:38
What happens now inside this agent, a
2:40
world model is now synthesized. So this
2:43
means we have the parametric knowledge
2:45
here from the pre-training and an
2:47
external data stream and somehow in this
2:50
world MDI now has the task to make sense
2:54
of the new data that are coming in that
2:56
are not yet knowledge and the parametric
2:59
knowledge from the pre-training phase.
3:02
So this is the first clash if you want
3:05
data encounters here knowledge. Now the
3:09
next frontier was knowledge graphs. Now
3:11
structured knowledge in particular forms
3:15
and we had this particular topology we
3:17
had particular mathematical spaces. Now
3:19
as you can see this is a year ago Howard
3:22
presents new knowledge graph agent two
3:24
months ago here lean rag multiple layers
3:26
of knowledge graph new knowledge graph
3:29
base drag sim rag and llm repairs
3:32
knowledge graph. I'm fighting here and
3:34
presenting you the latest research ideas
3:36
for more than a year on this topic and
3:38
even here how to combine knowledge graph
3:40
and agent here from Stanford University
3:42
go here with sentence bird encoder
3:45
structure multi- aent we went through so
3:49
much here in this endeavor together of
3:51
course we looked at graph neural network
3:53
we look not just at drag but at graph
3:55
rag the integration on higher
3:57
dimensional knowledge graphs everything
4:00
and then we went to in context learning
4:02
from the prompt generation to the
4:04
subgraph generation for the ego
4:06
methodology and the integration of rag
4:09
everything into textual gradients for
4:11
inter art artificial intelligence it was
4:13
just crazy but where are we now take a
4:16
step back and says okay either
4:19
we have now multi- aent every agent has
4:22
its own brain has a connectivity to the
4:24
internet to the database whatever and
4:26
either we do have a coordinating agent a
4:30
supervisor agent whatever you want to
4:31
call
4:32
or it is just here if you want like in a
4:35
beehive we just have here a local
4:39
coordination between local groups here
4:41
of multi- aent systems. So you see we
4:44
increased now the complexity and there's
4:47
a lot of information data and knowledge
4:50
generation within this multi- aent
4:52
network.
4:55
Now we noticed that with the old React
4:57
framework we got stuck in repetitive
4:59
failure cycles. it just repeated itself
5:02
and even graph neural network and vision
5:04
transformer especially when we extended
5:06
here to multimodal with images and video
5:10
they had limitations because they had
5:13
inherent complexity limitations. So what
5:16
we did we tried vertical reasoning to
5:18
overcome those applications. No. So here
5:21
you have it just three months ago we had
5:23
hierarchical reasoning models and two
5:25
months ago we had hierarchical reasoning
5:27
now on graph rack complexities itself.
5:30
So we have now LLMs arguing here on a
5:33
graph manifold on rag manifold and we
5:36
try to find here better solution the
5:38
next step in the evolution of AI
5:40
systems. And then we even went crazy
5:42
here for complete distributed neural
5:45
graph architecture for AI systems. And
5:48
Stanford University had some brilliance
5:49
idea you find here in this video 3
5:51
months ago.
5:54
And in this time I think we all
5:55
understood that the future of AI is not
5:58
solitary. So we can expect to see the
6:01
rise of more and more of those multi-
6:03
aent system where different AI agents
6:05
have specialized skills and they collate
6:08
with particular protocols. model context
6:11
protocol with tool use or simple API
6:15
calls here to solve problems that are
6:17
too complex for any single agent.
6:20
So you understand we are not anymore
6:21
talking about single individual agents
6:24
but now we go for a collective for a
6:27
hive mind
6:30
and of course you have here latest year
6:32
AI ecosystem regarding context
6:35
engineering cognitive upgrade for
6:37
multi-AI agent systems here or new
6:40
complete new protocols for multi- aent
6:43
for 100 plus agents how to communicate
6:46
data knowledge transfer how to learn and
6:49
even some beautiful new mathematical
6:51
ideas about direct asyclic graphs. If we
6:54
go here on network layers, where can we
6:58
find the new AI reasoning revolution?
7:00
Because our current AI systems are just
7:03
pattern recognition machines and nothing
7:05
else.
7:08
Now, where are we now? We have now here
7:11
a student or a little agent here sitting
7:14
on a full classroom with many other
7:16
agent with many other students. And now
7:19
they can ask now in the best case a
7:21
classmate for help on a mathematical
7:23
problem or brainstorm ideas together
7:25
divide up research task for a group
7:27
project. So at this moment I think we
7:30
all in the AI community understand it is
7:32
not anymore about individual agents. It
7:35
is now for a if you want a social
7:38
dynamic of a multitude of learning
7:41
entities agents that emerges where the
7:44
collective intelligence of a group
7:46
definitely surpasses here the
7:48
intelligence of any single individual
7:51
agents. So suddenly we're not talking
7:53
about about a single if you want AGI or
7:57
super intelligence or hyper intelligence
8:00
but we have here a social construct
8:05
and now the task suddenly became hey how
8:08
can we design the optimal framework for
8:09
a new human AI
8:13
interaction network augmentation system
8:17
work together however you want to call
8:23
Now just imagine we have here a group of
8:26
students here in a classroom and they
8:28
give him here a particular task. Hey,
8:30
let's think about a new form of
8:32
coordination here for whatever. Let's
8:34
say one student goes here to the the
8:37
whiteboard and writes down here. I think
8:40
direct democracy would be the perfect
8:42
way how to coordinate here the dense
8:44
flow of information of data of the
8:47
buildup of learning of knowledge and so
8:49
on. And then two other students go up
8:51
and say okay let's make a list of pros
8:54
and let's make a list of the cons. And
8:56
then another student goes up to the
8:57
whiteboard and says hm an alternative
9:00
would be technocracy here on the other
9:02
side. So you see multiple solutions
9:05
suddenly emerges if you have this hive
9:08
brain.
9:11
Now the beauty is from a mathematical
9:14
point of view that a graph can now
9:16
theoretically only extend it to any n
9:19
dimension that you like. And you know a
9:21
graph has a beauty because just two
9:24
years ago I did a lot of videos here how
9:27
to do a link prediction here in a graph.
9:30
If two networks semantic networks or
9:33
whatever networks we have are real close
9:36
can ani predict now here a thematic
9:39
topological link between two entities
9:43
between two groups between two
9:45
collectives whatever you like to see.
9:48
And we coded this here with graph
9:51
machine learning, graph sage,
9:53
everything. We had a look at neural
9:54
balmont for network here. Everything
9:56
great link prediction. Now our link
9:59
prediction today is a little bit more
10:00
complex because what we are we are
10:02
living on is a sphere a
10:04
three-dimensional sphere. And you see
10:06
here on the surface there are a lot of
10:09
data stream knowledge data points
10:11
everything is connected. We have a dense
10:13
knowledge network. If you want this is
10:16
if you want our complexity sphere and
10:18
the density of this interlink
10:22
mesh is here giving us or our AI system
10:26
currently the maximum level of
10:28
complexity that AI agent can solve not
10:32
in isolation but working together here.
10:35
So this helps me to understand our
10:37
complexity sphere and the current
10:38
limitation what do we have now we can go
10:41
on in the next step and think we have a
10:43
simple connectivity because this sphere
10:45
if you want is just a flat manifold and
10:48
on this sphere we have now some flat
10:51
cluster structure to develop let's say
10:53
this is here I don't know pharmacology
10:56
and this is your medicine and this is
10:58
here the finance cluster and this is
10:59
your whatever the clusters so you see
11:02
and then you have some connections
11:04
somehow with some data transfer but more
11:07
or less we have isolated clusters here
11:09
and you have your discipline your ivory
11:12
tower in the old uh analog
11:16
or with the new AI systems we can say
11:19
hey wait understanding that the earth is
11:22
not flat I hope you are familiar with
11:24
this concept but is here rather as
11:27
three-dimensional object and we are here
11:29
working here as I've showed you here on
11:31
a complexity sphere guess what We have
11:34
the complete inner volume of the sphere
11:38
to have direct correction from one side
11:41
to the other. Think about it if you're a
11:42
theoretical physicist as Einstein
11:44
Rosenbr here for the wormholes. Great.
11:49
So understanding this of course our AI
11:52
community further developed understood
11:54
here you see here the the sphere the
11:57
three-dimensional sphere the surface
11:59
here of a certain complexity. And if we
12:02
go deeper, it is not just here some I
12:05
don't know light beams crossing here
12:07
from one side to the other but we have
12:09
more complex subspaces here in the inner
12:12
volume if you want of this particular
12:15
object that should symbolize here our
12:18
intellectual complexity of an EI system.
12:21
So other subspaces in other dimension
12:25
and higher dimensional sp mathematical
12:27
spaces here also have a knowledge graph
12:30
structure also are interlin in a
12:32
particular way. So we have here complex
12:35
and dimensional spaces. It is not really
12:38
a fractal space because it has different
12:40
mathematical features but more about
12:42
this in a later video. But you see the
12:44
idea that we have currently how to build
12:46
up complexities and specialized
12:49
complexities specialist AI agent is
12:52
somehow connected to this image at least
12:55
in my simple mind
12:58
and at this point I think we all
13:00
understand that the goal here of
13:01
designing here our AI system is not for
13:03
the pure computation okay either you
13:06
have 200,000 GPUs or 2 million GPUs who
13:09
cares but it is for cognition we want to
13:13
achieve something that is not just
13:15
optimize the computation.
13:17
So the system should not just process
13:19
the information but create here an
13:21
environment where if you want a deeper
13:24
insight into the complexity into the
13:27
unsolved problems in theoretical physics
13:30
in mathematics in chemistry in medical.
13:33
This should be the emergent property of
13:36
the network.
13:39
And then we encountered here that it is
13:42
not as simple as we think because a
13:44
simple graph-based system is still
13:45
fundamentally if you want an ordered
13:47
system. If you look at the point from a
13:50
mathematical or theoretical physical
13:51
point of view on this system it explores
13:54
predefined pathways. You don't have
13:56
quantum fluctuations in this if you want
13:57
to see this. No, but we also understand
14:00
if you go from a mathematical uh branch
14:02
like chaos theory let's call it a true
14:05
insight that we have that
14:09
We need something that is much more a
14:12
creative environment
14:15
and there's something between a rigid
14:17
order and a total randomness. And this
14:19
is what the chaos theorists in
14:22
mathematics and theoretical physics call
14:23
the edge of chaos. So we need a little
14:26
bit of let me call it craziness
14:29
nondeterministic predefined pathways in
14:32
our complexity manifolds. We need some
14:35
creative minds that just inject the
14:39
right amount of chaos to create
14:41
something new. Jesus, I'm really
14:43
oversimplifying, but I hope you
14:44
understand what I want to express.
14:47
So the problem with a system at the edge
14:48
of chaos is now even if you have a
14:52
culturally real rich system is of course
14:55
here that you suddenly encounter new
14:57
features and this feature if you think
15:00
about AI and human is who gets the
15:04
resources who decides which path to take
15:08
how does the collective prevent know a
15:10
single powerful line of reasoning even a
15:13
wrong one from hijacking the entire
15:15
society.
15:18
So what we are suddenly now in this next
15:22
step if you want of EI development
15:24
encounter is a systems political science
15:29
dimension.
15:31
It is just who has the power to decide
15:34
and to allocate the resources to what
15:36
particular task. And this is not at all
15:40
something that we don't know. This is
15:42
exactly what happens in human politics.
15:45
human can do this so much better than
15:47
any AI machine.
15:50
But you see now this is a little bit
15:52
different. So let's design this. And I
15:54
thought hey let's do a gunk experiment
15:56
and let's say here the polace project.
15:59
Now remember 2,000 years ago here in old
16:02
Greece in Athens here about 2,000 years
16:05
ago you know the the rise of the
16:07
democracy here. What a beautiful idea.
16:11
But you know thinking about it we
16:13
understand that is now a democracy of
16:15
two very different species because we
16:18
have humans and if we follow Sam Oldman
16:21
here that AGI is just around the corner
16:24
and the eye and hopefully both are to a
16:27
certain kind intelligent but they also
16:30
extreme different so let's treat them
16:33
differently and it is not like in the
16:37
20th century here where we had here this
16:40
if you want this machinery and the
16:43
automatization.
16:45
This is now really different if we would
16:48
assume that there's really an
16:50
intelligence into our AI pattern
16:52
machines.
16:55
Both interact and live here in the same
16:57
system. Let's call it the planet Earth.
17:00
And we have global corporations from
17:01
OpenI to MA to Microsoft that create
17:05
those AI large language models that then
17:07
form agent and multi- aent system. And
17:10
now they live with us. They interact or
17:14
we interact with them every day at least
17:17
me and we kind I also start to kind of
17:21
depend on those AI system. But how can
17:24
we explore here the if you want
17:27
interconnect or if you want the social
17:29
dynamics of two heterogeneous subsystem
17:32
and their reliance on each other and how
17:34
can they develop here in a
17:36
co-development into the near future.
17:39
What social complexities could emerge
17:41
from this interaction of humor and AI?
17:46
Now you know Stanford has their own
17:48
department on this but my little mind
17:50
just has very simple ideas.
17:53
Now I see that a growing segment of
17:54
humanity
17:57
really has a problem that it cannot
17:59
function without AI assistance. And if
18:02
my circle of friends, I see some people
18:06
really communicate with an AI machine
18:09
like it would be another human person.
18:13
And I have to tell you a lot of jobs are
18:15
now AI augmented. You have people where
18:18
their health is AI monitored and their
18:20
if you want social life or what they
18:22
post on Facebook or whatever you have
18:24
are AI mediated. So there's a certain
18:28
kind of interlink already happening. So
18:31
this segment of humanity becomes really
18:34
dependent on the eye but they have of
18:38
course a vote if you want and they can
18:40
decide themselves but they also know
18:43
that the real power lies with let's call
18:46
this the interpreters. Now in the old
18:48
Greece 2,000 years ago in Athens under
18:51
Acropolis there would have called
18:53
priests and there would have been the
18:56
development of something what we call a
18:58
social norm and something that develops
19:01
into
19:02
let's call it a form of religion but
19:06
this is the topic of another video. So
19:08
simple question human need guidance is
19:10
this still a valid sentence? Do today's
19:14
human really need guidance? Do you need
19:16
the help of AI systems?
19:19
If so, we should think about a
19:20
co-evolutionary framework for human AI
19:22
integration into the society.
19:26
And I love this here from a theoretical
19:28
point of view because I simply see this
19:30
as subsystems. No. So I have the human
19:32
if let's call it the social interaction
19:34
subsystem. And what is the logic?
19:38
Our sociologist tell us here we have
19:40
normative and mimatic institutional
19:43
pressures. we should behave in a certain
19:45
way. We share certain norms. We share as
19:48
a community certain values. We have
19:52
maybe a similar culture. We share laws
19:56
and the imitation of sexual social
20:00
scripts that are executed by our
20:02
behavior in our social environment in a
20:05
social group.
20:07
And the authority is grounded through if
20:09
you want the social construct that we
20:12
build in our society like elections like
20:15
tradition or law
20:18
and its ultimate power is coercive and
20:22
regulatory.
20:25
Now what about the other subsystem? The
20:26
technical AI subsystem
20:29
governed by institutional pressures but
20:34
shaped if you want by coded utility
20:36
functions and constraint defined by its
20:40
corporate creators. Just remember what
20:42
Sam Oldman tells us here almost daily
20:44
here in its uh posts here how they
20:48
changed a little bit GBD5 the behavior
20:50
of GBD5.
20:51
They brought back GBD4 Omni with certain
20:54
personality traits and you see this is
20:57
really here the corporate creators and
20:59
they have an extreme influence.
21:03
This AI technical subsystem is
21:05
interesting because it will soon control
21:08
the operational infrastructure of modern
21:10
life from energy grids from logistic
21:13
chains from capital flows on a corporate
21:17
level on a personal individual level. I
21:20
think AI will penetrate into those
21:23
sectors and into our personal and
21:25
professional lives real soon.
21:29
So then we have to encounter here or
21:32
trying to understand the key dynamics of
21:34
the system integration.
21:37
And of course I think we will experience
21:39
some social fissures emerge here from
21:41
the friction between these two
21:43
incompatible logic systems between AI
21:47
and humans.
21:52
Now, I already mentioned this idea of a
21:54
priest elite. No, that happened 2,000
21:57
years ago, a long long time ago here.
22:00
Not just in Greece, but everywhere on
22:01
the planet. No,
22:04
human social goals like promote public
22:07
well-being or increase fairness or
22:09
whatever.
22:10
They must be translated now into the eye
22:13
system into formal quantifiable
22:16
objective functions value functions
22:19
reward structure training data that we
22:21
train in reinforcement learning our AI
22:24
systems on this
22:26
who decide on what particular reward
22:29
function to train JPT that is used let's
22:33
say by 800 or 900 million people daily
22:37
or weekly
22:39
This is really power and this
22:42
translation process how to design
22:46
the eye, the sensitivity of the eye, you
22:48
know, these nuances of the eye. This is
22:51
really a new critical locus of power.
22:54
Absolutely.
22:58
And now let's just do a little bit of a
23:00
speculation. I have here this crazy
23:03
idea. It's absolute crazy here.
23:06
There could be a very tiny chance that
23:10
there will or we will see the emergence
23:12
of a specification class let's call it a
23:16
technocratic elite an elite of policy
23:19
makers of let's call it data scientist
23:22
it's a little bit more than data
23:23
scientist and corporate strategist like
23:25
Sam Oldman whose primary skill is to
23:29
define to audit and negotiate here the
23:32
formal metric for the eye system. They
23:34
tune the eye system to what the society
23:37
wants them to behave.
23:40
And of course, I'm not a sociologist,
23:43
but I love to read a little bit of them.
23:45
And this can be multi as the creation of
23:48
a new form of a symbolic capital. If
23:51
you're interested in this, maybe you
23:53
want to read some of his work.
23:56
So suddenly I'm absolutely fascinated to
23:59
see where AI will lead us if we have
24:04
this human AI augmentation interaction
24:08
symbiosis.
24:10
However, I think that we still have an
24:12
asymmetric path dependency in our system
24:16
because it seems to me and maybe I'm
24:18
wrong that the human society is becoming
24:21
operationally dependent on the AI
24:23
subsystem for its stability. If I see
24:25
young students that that learn it's it's
24:29
crazy everybody's using more or less
24:31
here AI system chat GPD cloud for
24:34
programming and so on
24:36
critical functions of the state and the
24:38
market become now suddenly opaque to the
24:41
humans to the understanding democratic
24:44
oversight because the complexity is
24:47
managed exclusively now by AI subsystems
24:51
you don't have a human expert explaining
24:53
here complex lexities to you. You can
24:56
ask judg and judge will explain it to
25:00
you if it's correct or not. Who cares?
25:03
So, human institutions are left managing
25:06
the social consequences of blackbox AI
25:10
decisions without the ability to
25:12
influence here the mechanics of those
25:15
decisions. And a lot of people do not
25:17
even understand here to 5% how an AI
25:20
system works internally. the internal
25:22
let's call it mechanics of the working
25:27
and I think the primary social fissure
25:29
will be between if you want the
25:32
specification class the tech
25:34
billionaires
25:36
like Sam Oldman who really or or I don't
25:38
know an X here those billionaires who
25:42
can really define what behavior they
25:45
want from the AI system that is used
25:47
here by a billion people on this globe
25:51
and then The other side you have another
25:53
let's call it a class the systematically
25:56
managed class whose life whose
25:59
opportunities and the environments are
26:02
the raw material to be optimized by
26:04
those AI systems.
26:07
Maybe you understand what I want to tell
26:09
you with this sentence.
26:14
And for the humans I have to feel yeah
26:16
you can vote you have rights but maybe
26:19
you can change the values sometime for a
26:21
short period of time but you can't
26:24
change the underlying operational logic
26:27
of the system and I think this could
26:30
theoretically in the worst case scenario
26:32
lead to a political and social apathy
26:36
resulting in the isolation of
26:38
individuals and if you want a social
26:41
decoupling from the circle cles of
26:44
friends, friendship here near bonds and
26:48
I have to tell you I noticed this
26:50
myself. It is kind of crazy to formulate
26:53
this but I think this is really that I'm
26:56
becoming aware right now
26:59
and I think that social trust will also
27:01
fracture along the technological lines
27:04
not just around political parties and
27:06
hey every nation is different and you
27:08
have different degrees of craziness here
27:11
and political system. I'm not talking
27:13
about this. I'm talking about the AI
27:16
ecosystem and the impact they will have
27:18
on the human society. Because since
27:20
those AI system shape the information
27:23
and the opportunities the you the human
27:26
users see
27:28
those AI system have theoretically the
27:31
power to create your hardened sealed
27:33
communities
27:35
making here a social consensus a
27:37
structural impossibility.
27:40
And I think this is really kind of a
27:41
weaponization of the filter bubbles into
27:44
a fundamental infrastructure of an
27:47
advanced society
27:49
where we have this dense human AI
27:52
interaction patterns.
27:54
But you know what on the other side hey
27:56
we manage this already without AI
28:00
just by human stupidity and human
28:03
ignorance. We also have today in social
28:07
media our filter bubbles and we don't
28:11
even read here any argumentation. We
28:13
don't listen here to the other side. We
28:16
are closed up already without any eye.
28:19
So if I come back here to the beginning
28:21
of this video where I said hey the end
28:24
of EI you know what maybe EI is just
28:29
completely integrated within our society
28:32
within the next years. Maybe this will
28:35
become just a standard gadget or a
28:37
standard interaction here for our
28:39
society. Maybe we will not even notice
28:42
that it is another form of intelligence.
28:45
Maybe then we are absolutely familiar
28:47
with this alien kind of technology that
28:51
we have integrated into our professional
28:54
and personal lives and maybe this will
28:57
be the end of the eye.
28:59
I hope you enjoyed it. Maybe I see you
29:01
in my next videos.
