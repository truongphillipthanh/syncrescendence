**John Coogan:** Good to see you again. Hopefully you didn't have too much traffic. It's great to have you here. Big week for you.

**Bryan Johnson:** It's been a great week for us. Yeah, congratulations.

**John:** Sixty million—break down exactly what happened. What was the impetus for the deal? Take us through the recent history of Blueprint.

**Bryan:** I started this with the idea that we are the first generation who won't die. It's kind of a crazy idea. We started this a couple years ago and I think a lot of people thought this was insane. We've been hammering away, and I think it's gone from weird to interesting. Yesterday was like—now it's accepted and maybe even cool. It's a thing now. It's a part of the zeitgeist, and I think it formalizes that we're really going to take a shot at this.

**John:** There's the philosophical underpinning where you're, I imagine, in the vein of Kurzweil, looking at long-term trends, artificial intelligence, compounding—the value of compounding little gains all over the health system could, at least in your belief, get us to infinite life and not die. But then you need to instantiate that in a company, a business, a suite of products. That's what Blueprint is today. Is that the idea—that the fund raise is what people are investing in?

**Bryan:** When somebody says yes, I want to be healthy, it's pretty hard. You have to navigate a thousand things—is this good for me or bad for me? You have people with conflicting opinions. Our target customer is somebody who says I want to be healthy, and we just say, "We've got you." We'll give you the protein amounts. We'll give you tested and certified foods. We'll give you the exact dose. We'll help you with your prescriptions. We'll give you protocols. It's not go navigate the world by yourself. It's we've got you. We'll do an evidence-based biomarker approach.

**Jordi Hays:** One thing I felt like when I really got into health—I was 19 at the time—I realized I was spending like 50% of all my cognitive power just trying to be as healthy as possible. At a certain point I realized this is such an inefficient use of time. Fortunately you build up habits and understanding of what's good and bad, but I think removing that step from the process and being able to default into a system would be powerful.

**John:** Can you get into a little bit more the decision-making around where you wanted to take Blueprint, why you wanted to raise capital?

**Bryan:** My sole objective is to try to be sober about this moment, and I really enjoy the perspective of thinking a few hundred years into the future. You look back at this moment—we are giving birth to some kind of super intelligence. We don't know what it is. We don't know the scale, but it's big. It's important. I have neither an opinion that it's positive or negative. It's just significant. I was really trying to think through: does it even matter if I build anything in the world right now, or should I work on building the philosophy and the moral framework on what it means to be intelligent on planet Earth in this part of the galaxy? As an entrepreneur, do you build? Which way do you build? I was reflecting on whether I was misallocating my time. And I thought, really, Blueprint is the practical implementation of this philosophy. When you say yes to don't die, you're saying I value existence, I respect existence. It's less about living forever—it's more about a philosophy of yes, this moment is big. What a lot of people don't realize is this endeavor is entirely about AI alignment. That's the sole thing happening on the planet right now. When you take care of yourself, you take care of your body. When you take care of your body, you take care of intelligence. It's this holistic system of acknowledging existence. That's what I was trying to figure out—as a human, what do I do on planet Earth right now? I'm an entrepreneur. My intuitions are to be an entrepreneur, but I wondered: is that really the right way to do it?

**John:** What does Blueprint look like in a decade? It feels like such a unique consumer package goods business—I can't even call it that. In terms of the business, what people pay for, there's a lot. And that's just such a contrarian approach to this category, because so many people are like, I have an idea, I'm going to make coffee better, I'm going to make a greens powder better. They grow and grow, and then five years in they're like, let's do a line extension.

**Jordi:** The CPG trend of the last ten years was: go walk into the gas station, find a product that's popular, make a version that's 50% healthier, and you probably have a nine-figure revenue business. Or make nothing. Companies like Thrive Market, Arowain—there's a bunch like this. How did you land on wanting to make everything? That feels like an immense challenge.

**Bryan:** That's what Andrej Karpathy was talking about with autonomous systems and door dash. He and I think very similarly. If you model out what AI systems will do, they'll take on more autonomous responsibility in our lives. We see beginnings—you plug an address into a car and it helps you navigate. You don't think about it. We're going to build our autonomous self. Our health will be run on our behalf. Right now we chase down all our food, protocols, evidence. But it won't be that in the future. It will just be run for us. As we get measurement that's more high-fidelity, Blueprint is basically saying: we are going to build your autonomous system of health, and we're going to ride the breakthroughs of science. As we make better progress in lowering the speed of aging and reversing aging damage, you can just say I'm in, and I'm going to ride with you. We're trying to be on the very forefront to help people have the best possible health. So we're just building autonomous health systems.

**Jordi:** That feels super valuable just from the consumer experience. I'm delegating all of that hassle. I know basically if I buy from one brand, it's all aligned with one philosophy. What does that mean on the logistics side? What does that mean on the capex side? What does that mean on the operational cost side? Do you have like 25 different product managers for each niche? Like what's the shape of the company?

**Bryan:** Very big challenge. We're standing up like ten different businesses at the same time.

**Jordi:** Exactly. There's plenty of people that could have done what you did—become famous, become content creators, and then they're like, now I have one product. You're like, now I have how many products?

**Bryan:** Over 20.

**Jordi:** Over 20. Yeah. And it's clear that you probably have done this because you've been a successful entrepreneur before. You're like, yeah, I can probably do more than one. But what does the business look like? Does the system look like? Are there cross-selling benefits in retail on day one, or is this just an e-commerce play? Like, how do you think about the costs and benefits of going multi-product so soon?

**Bryan:** When people want to be healthy, you can't just address one thing. They're still left with 99 things to deal with. I get the consumer value makes a ton of sense. Internally, we're building out the infrastructure to deliver every single channel—digital, food, prescriptions, testing. I've done this myself for the past five years. We've mastered the system for me. I've been fighting to achieve the best biomarkers in the world. It's a ridiculous idea, but also like it's a new sport. It could become a thing. We've mastered it, built it, now we're productizing.

**John:** Every consumer has probably gone through frustration of finding a product they love and watching the company behind it steadily try to maintain or increase margins to the point where it's no longer the same product. I imagine you want Blueprint to be what you're relying on for the majority of your calories, the majority of supplements, the majority of drugs. Do you have any ethos around that? Because every company goes from founder to acquirer, and the new acquirer says, hey, we could source this salt from over there, save 80%, and nobody will notice because it tastes similar. But then tests start showing up and it's actually got lead in it.

**Bryan:** I'm Blueprint's number one customer. I appreciate it so much. When we first started this project, I was testing everything I put into my body—air, water, food, everything. I learned first of all: food is guilty until proven innocent. It is so toxic, no matter where you get it.

**Jordi:** People were freaking out last week when that protein powder report came out saying a bunch of them had lead in it. My immediate reaction was obviously a lot of this stuff has lead in it. Look at the average chocolate bar—it's got a ton of lead in it. You can't isolate that one toxin, but there are so many other toxins. People grab onto one concept they understand: oh, that's bad. There's trace levels of heavy metals in all of our foods.

**Bryan:** The fact that it's there is not disarming. It's just out of context, but it's at a level people understand. My goal is—Blueprint is my way to try to achieve the don't die philosophy. People will be riding along. We build on population-level data. This is not about Brian Johnson's body. This is about everybody's body. All ages, both genders. We're being meticulous about what we do, and the quality will be the best in the world. I care about this. I'm consuming all of it myself.

**John:** What about the telemedicine front? Interventions or therapies that require doctor involvement?

**Bryan:** We'll build infrastructure so when you want a prescription—if you want to go on a GLP-1, we can help you get started, whether you want a large dose or micro dose. You say yeah, and also I'll do the lab testing and build... I'll be mining the metal that gets turned into the needle that injects you with it. You want to hold up the entire global economy.

**Jordi:** I love it. It's good ambition. I strongly support this. I was interested in where the edges are—where you'd be like, yeah, actually I'm not going into that market. But it feels like you'll just continue to work on it until you reach some status where you're like, yeah, actually it would work. Would you go into hospitality? Create physical retreats—evidence-driven, testing-focused? I could imagine a Blueprint retreat center people could visit once a year.

**Bryan:** We have about a dozen groups around the world that want to stand this up, and some of the biggest hotel chains in the world. The thing is they just want credibility. They want to say, come here, we have this thing structured. When I meet with some of the most powerful people in the world, they're just as clueless as everyone else. It's not like rich and powerful people just have it solved. We are going to stand this up. We probably will not do physical clinics—it's just too much on the real estate. We'll probably license it out. We'll do the digital model. We want to have a model across food and clinics where we have this evidence-based approach. We're kind of in it to blanket the entire industry with a framework on how to do things in a credible, biomarker-led, evidence-based way.

**John:** What was the thesis behind the round? Sixty million, tons of faces—not the traditional CPG VCs or private equity folks.

**Bryan:** I've been funding the company myself up until this point. I wanted my friends to come along with me. These are people I talk to in private. They enjoy it, they're into it. A lot of people didn't know how to think about me. Am I legit? Am I not? Is this weird? They see that list of investors and they're like, oh shit. Yesterday, I think, was the first day it was like, oh, it's safe to say this is cool, whereas before that it flipped a long time ago.

**Jordi:** I feel like the first piece you did that went super viral was when you spent two million on your health.

**Bryan:** Yeah, that was two or three years ago.

**Jordi:** I feel like that was the moment where people dug into your backstory and were like, oh yeah, you sold a company. My personal view is that America has had so little trust in health institutions over the last few years. If you just followed the American Heart Association's guidance, you'd probably die at like sixty, right? So I was always like, you can read about health, listen to podcasts, listen to influencers, but to deeply understand your health, you have to do self-experimentation. Everybody is different. I always tried to be controversial enough to generate attention—attract superfans and lose some people—and I was kind of okay with that. My sense was always: thank you, somebody is going to invest more money than basically anyone else in self-experimentation and open-source all of that. Now people can buy your olive oil if they want, or decide to go on their own journey. It felt like such a public benefit that I always wished there were a thousand Brian Johnsons all running the same experimentation, open-sourcing the process.

**John:** The biggest thing we talked about the other day is that health influencers quickly get into a niche. They're like, I'm the fasting guy, I'm the HRV guy, and then everything becomes about that. You can tap into a world and accelerate understanding of a category, but in reality, it's not like fasting is the only thing that matters. It's just one tool.

**Jordi:** I have another take on that. There's this trend in health influence where if I want to blow everyone's brain, I come in and say, guess what, I boil it all down: sleep, diet, and exercise. That's 99% of what you need to do. Everyone's like, man, this guy's not talking about crazy supplements. He's just telling it like it is. Then after I've made one hour of content every week for five years on sleep, diet, exercise, I'm like, you know what, let's talk about the 17th piece of magnesium you should take or the thing that's beneficial but it's 0.001%. It's still interesting, but it's not going to have the power law effect like actually start working out or actually get sleep. Do you wrestle with that? Do you feel like you have to go back to the basics?

**Bryan:** I think what most people struggle with is doing things they don't want to do. They don't want to overeat. They don't want to eat a pint of ice cream. So yes, those things are really the highest leverage interventions. It's behavioral. You can say sleep and exercise, but when you dive deep, you uncover that American society is fundamentally one of addiction. The American powers of capitalism have pointed at getting people addicted to food, sugar, nicotine, porn, junk food. If you look at Western thought—Aristotle, Christianity, medieval times, renaissance, enlightenment, modern scientific era—there are these big frames, and we're due for a major shift. We're at the tail end. This is like Dio's thought process about macro trends. Capitalism was for solving scarcity. We're now compulsive. Democracy was freedom of choice. We now have no longer choice because we're addicted. We're playing on this very big macro frame. We're at a different time as a species. So yes, sleep and exercise, but in this larger frame, it's about what it means to be intelligent, make decisions. You can't when you're addicted to everything.

**Jordi:** What about longer-tail interventions? Like the third peptide that's not approved yet, but people are already taking it. Is unregulated biohacking becoming more prevalent? Is that the correct world in a world where the FDA is broken? Or does the FDA need to change? How should we map accelerating advances in science with maybe stagnation in regulatory?

**Bryan:** Peptides are very powerful. They're basically drugs. You get access to drug-like effect sizes. The problem is peptides are often not manufactured to spec, so you have risks like putting stuff in your body that you shouldn't. They could have lead in them just like your chocolate bar. Same with stem cells. There's a real quality problem. The other problem is a lot of peptides are not fully characterized. Typically drugs say: you can do this thing, but here's the long list of side effects. At least you know the trade-off space. With these peptides, you don't have the characterization, so there's bigger risk. You see a lot of this in bodybuilding, biohackers doing it. It's fine if you understand it's the wild west. It may be your game, may not. But you want to be cautious. It's not a safe path. There are other things—start with the highest level of evidence. Sauna is great. But if you don't ice your boys in the sauna, you crush. It's not going to be as effective.

**Jordi:** Can you make an ice pack? I used to use—there used to be this ice pack on Amazon for this use case, and they stopped selling it.

**Bryan:** They don't want you icing your boys. A lot of men will say I'm not trying to have babies, so it doesn't matter. But it has negative feedback on hormone health.

**Jordi:** Interesting. So yes, sleep and exercise is great, but then you dive into the details. You inevitably spend 50% of your time chasing down every weird root cause. It's never easy. You have infinite chase.

**Bryan:** That's the problem I'm trying to solve. Nobody has 50% of their time to do this.

**John:** How are you thinking about wearables? Because there's a future where you have a camera that's effectively a sensor that can experience life in your view, and that as a health co-pilot would be wild. Like, hey, you've already eaten well beyond your assumed needs. Your daily caloric needs—you're going into a surplus. Maybe ease off. Meta Rayban displays need a killer app. That sounds like something you should build.

**Bryan:** GLP-1s are kind of that, I mean a little bit. It's like modulating your hunger and satiety. How do you think we'll view GLP-1s and the explosion of their use in 50 years? It's probably the most successful anti-aging drug ever built. It's incredible. The benefits keep accumulating. Yes, there are drawbacks. They're getting better all the time.

**John:** Do you feel the same way about statins?

**Bryan:** Those are complicated. Statins do have benefits, but they're complicated.

**Jordi:** Do you feel like there's any value to reading into the conspiracy vibes around the fact that Ozempic came from a demon—like the Gila monster? Isn't that what it is? Gila monster, Komodo dragon venom or something? It just feels wrong, right? Humanity 101 is like, yeah, don't drink. Don't become the reptile. Don't drink the reptile venom.

**John:** Brian might be trying to become the reptile.

**Jordi:** The Sonoran Desert toad gave us 5-MeO-DMT, and I would say that's bad too. Just got FDA approval for treatment-resistant depression.

**Bryan:** Yeah. If you're sad, you need the toad to cheer you up, I suppose. I'm happy if it's helping people.

**Jordi:** It is just funny when we were looking at the story of Ozempic like a year ago. What's your view on GLP-1s? I think everybody's hoping maybe GLP-1s are this, and people haven't fully realized it yet. For a while, everybody was just hoping that by the time I'm really aging, there will just be a pill I can take and halt or maybe even reverse. How open are you to the idea that there could be something an order of magnitude more effective than GLP-1s in terms of anti-aging? Where do you put the probability there?

**Bryan:** There was a study out of China in June. They took a form of FOX3 protein, used CRISPR, put it in a mesenchymal stem cell, and delivered it via intravenous treatment. In monkeys, it had a three to five year age reversal in over 50% of tissues, which is unseen. For human equivalent, that'd be like nine to 15 years roughly. These demonstrations are being done. I think we'll probably hit peak in something like GLP-1s around 2032, roughly. Then a few things will hit—people like, it's here. Then people will think they're going to live forever, then there will be a crash—oh, actually there's still more problems to solve. 2035, 2037, people are like, oh man, it's not solving this or that, we have these complications. Early 2040s, people like, actually we got this. Something like that.

**John:** There's this interesting paper that came out of Levinson where he said after we reproduce, our cells lose purpose. Like, we don't have a unifying objective. Cells just don't know what to do. Aging just happens. If his model is correct, biology needs don't die. They actually need an objective at a macro scale, at our level of cognition, but also at a cellular level.

**Bryan:** These are the kinds of experiments people are doing—what is the underlying incentive structure of biology? Why do we age? Why don't we age in certain parts of our life? Why do we have protective mechanisms? Why do some species regenerate? It's this really exciting frontier where our ideas about aging are beginning to crack open and expand our horizons. How do we think about time? We talked about this last time—Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, not particularly famous for their biohacking, but incredibly resilient, a life well-lived. So many stories about them staying up drinking Coca-Cola and wine long into the night. I want to believe there's some level of: if you have purpose, if you have drive, your body pulls it together a little bit more.

**Jordi:** I know people want this to be the answer. It's such a bad idea because people make that shortcut in their mind. They're like, you know what, I just got to work harder.

**Bryan:** Yeah.

**John:** Did we cure balding? There was that study last week?

**Bryan:** They're all weak effects. We really have not made good strides on hair loss. It's a little embarrassing as a human race. It seems very simple. Very mechanical. Hair just grows. It should be easy. We're working on it. We just put out our best attempt and we're going to see if it works. We're going to try to beat everything that's out there on the market.

**John:** How important is cosmetic intervention to the Blueprint plan? Because you could imagine a world where people say, yeah, make me live forever, but I don't care about wrinkles and hair because unless it's going to help me actually live longer, why bother?

**Bryan:** Don't die is really about being hot. What's every supplement company, every company in health selling at the end of the day? I think this is brilliant from a business perspective, and it also makes sense in terms of the science. Being hot is good science. If you look youthful and vibrant, your skin is nice, you have a lot of energy. Being hot is legit the path for this.

**Jordi:** Be hot, don't die.

**John:** How do you think about longevity in the business? If you look at the DTOC bubble, there were companies that raised similar amounts of money and are no longer with us. I imagine you care a lot about making sure Blueprint survives decades and that's informing how you're building. If you look at the internet, Google sets up shop and rides that tailwind. Amazon sets up shop on commerce. Basically somebody's going to set up shop in longevity and ride a multi-trillion dollar market.

**Bryan:** That's what we're trying to do. We're trying to be home base, win the early innings of longevity, and then ride the multi-trillion dollar market.

**John:** Do you think M&A will be pretty important to your strategy? There are companies that are important, like single-product or for specific use cases. They don't necessarily need to be standalone because if you're a Blueprint customer, maybe you need it once every three years. That means it could be harder to build a business around, but it would slot in.

**Bryan:** You nailed it. If you look at the landscape in health right now, nothing is proprietary. You got wearables from all these different providers, food from different providers, biomarkers—nothing proprietary. The winner's going to have to out-compete everybody by bringing an experience to the customer that's sensible and practical. I think that's where the competition is going to be. When I was building Braintree and Venmo, it was commoditized. You're all in the Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover stack. You have to build something unique. Braintree and Stripe collapsed the market.

**Jordi:** Now I want to hear the story of the Venmo acquisition.

**Bryan:** In payments, it was very clear PayPal was the only company making money because they had both sides of the market. They got lucky because they got into eBay. They built the consumer side, but then they had the merchant side too. If you just offer it to merchants, your margins are pretty low—20, 50 basis points. Everybody was going after PayPal, trying to build a two-sided marketplace. It takes a lot of capital. It's very hard to build from scratch. I said, okay, I'm going to build the merchant side first, then I'm going to acquire the consumer side. We got customers like Airbnb, Uber, GitHub. We got all the Gen Z people, and then Venmo had done a fantastic job building out the consumer side. We could then marry those two demographics, and it's like perfect. They had built a great business, but they hadn't solved making money. When they plugged into our world, we bought them for 26.2 million.

**Jordi:** How much of that was not making money because of fraud? I hear that from a lot of fintech companies. The unit economics should work, but it's always crazy in the early days. PayPal was losing tons of money, but it was only because of fraud. The actual business, when it wasn't fraudulent, made sense. Once you get to scale, you can do the anti-fraud properly. Was that something you were problem-solving?

**Bryan:** It's very hard because you're doing peer-to-peer, and typically you have illicit purposes as your driver. It's a very hard problem. As a standalone, it's hard for them to make sense because if you stack on a fee when you're paying your buddy, it's hard friction in adoption. So you have to speedrun adoption and then make money later. But there was no good make money later path. Big cash problem.

**John:** I was running a shower thought. There's so much capital sloshing around the private markets. It's been interesting that we haven't seen more people try to take on Stripe. I'd be curious—at what point will people even try to climb that mountain?

**Bryan:** Very unlikely. They've done such a great job executing. I sold Braintree in 2013. They've been building for 12 years since. They've done such a good job making that airtight. That's the thing: you can't come in and make it 10x better product. Amazon locked commerce. You can build your e-commerce business on Shopify, but at scale, Amazon owns that entire thing. It's very hard to replicate. That's our goal too—we're basically trying to do that for longevity. Once you collapse the entire space, it's very hard to get in.

**Lightning Round**

**John:** Okay, we got a lightning round. Favorite book or just a book recommendation? Something you read recently that you like?

**Bryan:** I just finished The History of the Western Mind, going through all of Western thought.

**Jordi:** Cool. Favorite music? What's in your rotation?

**Bryan:** I have such a soft spot for Eminem. When I was depressed, he was the only artist I could feel.

**John:** Love it. When will humanity develop AGI?

**Bryan:** That's such a hard question. You don't want to sound like a doomer. You don't want to be... (laughs) Call it right now, yeah?

**Jordi:** I want to be able to clip this the day of and be like, I want to say—I want to say that we'll be nice to you and we won't clip this. But I know our clipping infrastructure, and we absolutely will clip this. It's such a sucker question.

**John:** Well, maybe let's flip it around. OpenAI and Microsoft did this deal where the definition of AGI will be convened by a group of experts. What's your definition of AGI?

**Bryan:** I approach this through psychology—when will humans feel useless? Our entire identity is based on doing things, contributing, building. Now AI is a tool. We feel more productive with it. At what point will it do everything so well you feel this deep hole in your stomach of like, what do I do?

**Jordi:** The weird thing is computers are incredible at chess, yet people play chess for fun and at the professional level because humans are anti-player and they like watching humans play. If we can solve that for everyone so that everyone has some sort of activity even in this AGI world where there's no more real jobs, no more actual need to produce something for livelihood—everything is just for fun, for games, for status. Wasn't Andrej Karpathy saying you go to the gym and you learn in the future? I wonder if your definition is once that breaks down?

**Bryan:** That feels really far. I like that. People look forward to retirement like it's an ideal. We're gonna get an RV, cruise the country. Then they retire and it's like, this sucks. There's not the tension. If we imagine we're going to learn and do yoga all day and paint, but if there's not the tension of stress and real life, do we really want to be on vacation all the time? Do we want to be at leisure? That's what I think about—when that happens, it's a pretty unnerving situation because humans don't do well with that uncertainty, and our systems have to respond. That's what I really think about all day. Everyone in the end is just going to be competing on biomarkers. It's going to be the final status game, the final game that aligns with Karpathy's take.

**John:** Last lightning round question, and then I want you to ring the gong. Favorite vacation spot? Where would you go for a trip?

**Bryan:** Redwood forest.

**John:** Redwood forest. I love redwoods. Staying in California?

**Bryan:** Yeah, I would love. I love redwoods.

**Jordi:** This is John. There's John. I love California. You don't need to go to Europe. I love America. You don't need to get all the radiation on the plane. Just stay here. They're like such beautiful, majestic creatures. They live a long time.

**Bryan:** It's very on brand for you.

**John:** Congratulations on the round—60 million. Fantastic progress. I'd love for you to ring that gong at a decibel level that you feel is appropriate for hearing. Actually, let me pull out my decibel meter. Let me teach you about it. We don't want to be over 80 dB because we do have hearing protection, but I'd love to know what an 80 decibel ring sounds like.

**Bryan:** I recently measured my ears—my left ear is 64. I have mild to moderate hearing loss, which substantially increases your risk of dementia because you don't perceive reality properly. Your brain's missing all these things. Hearing loss affects concerts, social gatherings, restaurants. I'd suggest everyone get a hearing test. I just got hearing aids.

**John:** So all right. Here we go. Yeah. Hit the gong at a longevity-approved level.

**Bryan:** What are we at?

**John:** We're at 90.

**Bryan:** About that level. If we go any higher, we're going to need just a tad more. There we go. That is the Bryan Johnson-approved hit.

**Jordi:** You heard it here. I bet everyone in the chat is like, oh finally, because we smacked that thing so loud. Do you have tinnitus?

**Bryan:** No, I don't.

**Jordi:** Okay. But I do. I've had it since my Coachella era. Yeah. I don't go to concerts at all. I don't pay to stand in crowds and lines. I specifically recall the exact weekend it started. It's a pretty significant thing in your life?

**John:** No. I zone it out. But if I take a time in a really quiet space, I realize I have constant ringing. Have you looked into hearing aids?

**Jordi:** No. Yeah. Maybe I should.

**Bryan:** So I just got the Oticon Intense. That increases your... (not wearing them right now). You're not right now. Yeah. But you've been testing them out.

**Jordi:** Exactly. I actually am so sad. I was running out the door and I forgot them because I just finished my morning routine. I'm still sad. But yeah, they actually have substantially improved my life.

**Bryan:** Wow.
