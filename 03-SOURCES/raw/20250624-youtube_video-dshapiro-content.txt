Introduction
0:00
Well, good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome or welcome back as the case
0:06
might be. My name is Dali Bor Petravich. I'm your host to these tectonic conversations. And today I have a very,
0:13
very special guest on a very important and very timely topic. I am thrilled to
0:19
welcome David Shapiro. David, thank you very much for finding time to be with me and with us today.
0:25
Thank you so much for having me. It's a pleasure, David. David is a technologist and a futurist
0:32
selfdescribed AI maximalist but for the purpose of this conversation David has
0:38
emerged as the leading voice in the new movement that is focusing on post labor
0:45
economics and this drew my attention when I first came across David and his work about
0:52
probably six months ago now. Um I had a pleasure of spending three decades in
0:57
technology and the last two of those with the world's largest professional services firm as a senior partner. I
1:06
came across some of the world's most successful and smartest business leaders
1:11
and policy makers. Um, and that actually
1:16
helped me pay attention to what I first heard David say.
1:24
And since then, I've spent increasing amount of time following and understanding the model that is
1:30
emerging. And I feel it is superbly important for all of us to actually be paying attention to what David has to
1:37
say. Your hypothesis, David, and the emerging thesis and theory has helped put a face
1:46
and name to the underlying observation,
1:52
concern and angst that I feel and I feel many are feeling about what is actually
1:58
happening out there in our society and in our economy. And the idea of this
2:04
conversation was to provide an additional platform for you, David, to
2:10
address audiences that would not have come across you yet, people who might be
2:16
following me and my channel. Um, and for those who are interested, I would warmly
2:21
invite you to think about how you might get involved and help this movement progress because I believe we are
2:28
addressing here one of the most pertinent and serious questions that we will be facing in our societies going
2:34
forward. So now that I raised all the urgency to this, David, thank you very
2:40
much for your time again. Um, what is post labor economy and why should we be
2:46
caring about it? Yeah, I mean well thank you for the uh kind introduction. Uh in the very
What is PostLabor Economics
2:53
shortest version of post-labor economics is the observation that productivity has
2:58
been decoupling from labor inputs for quite a few decades now since about the 1950s. And with the rise of more
3:07
technologies, the so-called fourth industrial revolution where we have humanoid robots, artificial intelligence, we are seeing that
3:14
accelerate a little bit as these new generalpurpose technologies uh saturate and diffuse out into every sector. We're
3:22
the the writing on the wall that many feel is what am I going to do for work?
3:28
And that's why this framework was ultimately dubbed posts labor economics is because the anticipation is that
3:34
we're heading towards a paradigm where most economic activity uh dollar for
3:39
dollar is generated not by human inputs but by machine inputs and that's the overarching idea of post labor
3:46
economics. So the idea is that as technology displaces work, what we can
3:53
foresee is that we are now facing technology that can actually displace
3:58
all different types of work to a point where we can see the horizon where there is no more work available for humans
The frontier of automation
4:07
mostly. Uh certainly the the the lion's share of work is vulnerable to
4:13
automation today. Uh, as most people know, we moved from an agrarian economy
4:19
to a manufacturing economy, and now we're in a service-based economy. Well, service-based economies are predicated
4:24
primarily on knowledge work. And artificial intelligence is getting smarter and better at reasoning and
4:30
cognition and planning. Uh just a few days before this recording uh two labs
4:35
both openai and Google won gold medal on the international math olympiad uh which
4:41
is the most prestigious math competition in the world. Uh and this was not predicted by anyone to happen for
4:48
another year or two. And that kind of advanced schedule that calendar where
4:53
everyone where things happen faster than people anticipated has been the norm in this space for the last few years.
4:59
Correct. So when you look at the capabilities expanding you say okay well this frontier of automation this is a
5:05
term by Anton Corn uh who's an economist who is a visiting fellow at IMF
5:11
uh he coined the term the frontier of automation and basically that says this
5:16
is the sphere of which uh machines are capable of displacing human labor. So
5:21
when you take those two facts that it that the machines are getting smarter and we presently have a knowledgebased
5:27
economy because something like 80% of jobs in the uh in in developed economies
5:33
such as America and Europe are service- based. So they are knowledge work, retail, that sort of thing. That means
5:40
the lion share of jobs out there today could be vulnerable to being completely
5:45
replaced or through a process what's called labor substitution. Um so it could be substituted for machines here
5:51
very soon in very short order. Yeah. Yeah. So to help us address this uh I know that you're working on
5:57
publishing a book that the book is going to contain six parts. These six parts
6:03
are taking the concept from introducing the concept and and and and sort of proposing the challenge all the way
6:10
through to some concrete ideas on what could individuals, organizations and
6:18
nations do to address this situation. What I would like to do David is to walk
6:24
through these six parts today with you one by one um so that we can have you
6:30
know a meaningful robust conversation on each and I would also invite audiences who are following us live if they have
6:36
any questions to use Q&A function of this platform and submit a question. So we're not going to be able to address
6:43
questions on chat but please if you have a question submit using Q&A. So let's start at the beginning at part one
6:50
chapter one which is rays of automation. Can you sort of set us up with with with
6:56
a with a basic understanding where where should people start? Yeah. I mean the fundamental uh
The long arc of automation
7:03
assertion here is that automation has been advancing for actually several
7:09
centuries. Uh for me personally, it kind of really started with the printing press, the Gutenberg printing press in
7:16
the 15th century, which cut down the amount of time that went into printing books by a factor of about 200. Uh so
7:24
instead of taking a year or two for each copy of a book, it took a couple weeks.
7:29
Uh now, to be fair, setting up all the the print faces took a couple years, but once you got it set up, you could easily
7:35
print hundreds of the same uh book. uh advance forward you have the first
7:40
second and third industrial revolutions which included steam power uh mechanized power diesel uh solar uh not solar uh
7:48
internet and so on. So you have this uh long
7:53
where humanity has been automating away tasks starting with strength and then uh
7:59
to a lesser extent dexterity after that because there's basically four primary food groups of of labor that humans can
8:07
do. So it's strength, dexterity, cognition and empathy. So we've automated we've automated away the human
8:13
need for strength. We did that a long time ago with steam power, uh with diesel power, with electrical power and
8:19
that sort of thing. We are working on automating away dexterity with industrial robots and soon humanoid
8:26
robots. Uh and now the latest wave in the fourth industrial revolution is we're automating away the need for human
8:32
cognition and human empathy with uh the rise of generative artificial intelligence technology like chat GPT
8:39
and similar. Uh so with that that is the that is the in a nutshell the long arc
8:45
of the rise of automation. And so what we show and what we find unequivocally
8:50
is that as automation advances it dislocates more and more labor. 200
8:56
years ago in the year 1800 about 70 to 80% of Americans were farmers. A century
9:02
later in 1900 it was about 40%. Today it's 2%. So that entire way of life
9:08
where the majority of people worked a certain way, worked and lived a certain way in the span of two centuries
9:14
basically became extinct. Now that's not to say that farming went away, but farming became so much more efficient
9:21
that only a tiny fraction of the population is required to feed. not just the rest of the nation but then export
9:27
food export. Yeah. And so when you see that paradigm shift and you say well what caused this? It
9:33
was a combination of automation technologies and general purpose technologies. Now one of the differences
9:38
so this is one of the things that I get challenged on often is what's different about the fourth industrial revolution.
9:44
The difference here is that AI is both an automation technology and a general
9:49
purpose technology. So some of the most famous general purpose technologies are going to be things like the wheel and
9:55
the internet and steam power and electricity. Those are general purpose technologies which have many many use
10:01
cases. However, artificial intelligence is also an automation technology in that
10:06
it directly replaces or approximates human activities. A steam engine gives
10:12
you a lot of torque, right? The internet uh is a faster way of communicating over long distances. But artificial
10:18
intelligence is we call it artificial intelligence because it is an artificial version of human intelligence.
10:24
Uh so yeah that's that's the long history of automation and uh the rise of automation through several economic
10:30
paradigms and industrial revolutions. So what you said I think is really really important to understand that there are
10:37
four ways in which humans contribute to productivity.
10:42
strength, dexterity, intelligence and empathy.
10:48
Yep. And what you are effectively describing is that strength has been automated
10:54
since the very beginning. One could say even now agricultural revolution 12,000
10:59
years ago started us on replacement of human strength with bulls pulling plows
11:06
on on on on the fields. Right? So it could go all the way back. But we are now in the process where
11:13
all the other three are being actively attacked or displaced with automation,
11:20
intelligence and dexterity and ultimately empathy. And that is I think really really important to appreciate.
11:27
And the second thing that I think you mentioned was is important to to to stress
11:33
and maybe this is for the first time ever that we have not created just a tool which is what we've done in the
11:39
past but we have created actually an agent who has the ability to think and
11:45
perhaps decide. So this is a different ballgame altogether.
11:52
Now many people would say this is okay. We've been through this before. It is uncomfortable but you know it'll be just
12:00
like last time. Many jobs are going to go away because these four will be
12:07
supplemented by technology but there will be new jobs coming that we still
12:12
cannot imagine yet. Do you have any sort of reflection
12:18
on that? Yeah. So first to validate there there are often labor rebounds after these
New jobs coming
12:25
kinds of innovations. Yeah. Uh so you know for instance cloud engineers right you know YouTube influencers those jobs
12:32
did not exist 150 years ago and even explaining what those jobs would have been to someone would have been near
12:37
impossible 150 years ago. So technology often does create new affordances that
12:43
say okay we have a new structure a new way of delivering value and creating goods and services. Uh so therefore we
12:50
can hypothetically proliferate the number of jobs. However there's a few caveats. First and foremost is that
12:57
every time we've had disruptive technology so a process called creative destruction uh which was a term coined
13:03
by von Mises uh century ago. So creative destruction is usually painful. Uh, and
13:11
the reason that it's painful is because the current way of doing things, your status quo, the what you're used to,
13:17
gets disrupted, gets up upended, and it takes a while to produce something new. So, there's what's called angles pause
13:23
from the early 19th century where uh weavers and loom operators were
13:28
replaced, and it took about 60 to 70 years for wages to go up again. So
13:35
basically as that technology was saturating industrial England,
13:40
an entire generation or two went by without their their quality of life
13:45
really materially improving. And that's kind of what people are really afraid of is saying, okay, yes, in the long run,
13:52
artificial intelligence and robots and quantum computing and all of those things, there could be entire jobs and
13:58
entire sectors that we can't even imagine. But how long is it going to take to realize those se those those new
14:04
sectors and will they materialize in the first place? So those are some of the some of the major concerns around okay
14:11
yes does it create new jobs you know the lite fallacy is the idea that that technology destroys jobs permanently and
14:17
they never come back and I like to flip that on its head and call it the labor substitution fallacy.
14:23
Uh, and this is something that I just kind of made up and and it's a it's a term that I use to say actually
14:29
technology doesn't create new jobs. It never has. What technology actually does
14:34
is that it creates deflationary pressure so that you have capital that is then liberated for to to supply other demands
14:42
uh of goods and services. But there is no law of physics or law of economics
14:47
that says new goods and services must be rendered by human input. There's no there's no need for it. if if
14:53
if you can provide some service or some good where it's just machines giving it to you, there's no reason to have a
15:00
human involved. Now, historically, humans have been involved just by virtue of the fact that human labor has been
15:06
the only thing that is intelligent enough and flexible enough to render most goods and services. But the
15:12
fundamental assumption or or thesis underpinning post-labor economics is maybe humans are not the primary
15:19
producers in the future. That's where we're coming from. Yeah. Yeah. So, so, so in that first
15:25
chapter, Rise of Automation, what what is the takeaway? What's what's what's
15:30
the, so what's the point? What's what's the aha here for for for audience to take away?
15:36
So, the primary thing is whenever you're looking at these paradigm shifts, you say, what what problem are we solving? The first and second industrial
15:43
revolutions solved strength, right? We harnessed steam. We harnessed coal. We harnessed petroleum. And so now we had
15:50
an abundance of calories that we could use for mechanical torque and thermal energy. So that's what we saw. So we
15:56
ended up with with you could probably call them an era of thermal abundance. That's what we created with the first
16:02
and second industrial revolution. Yeah. The third industrial revolution was the digital revolution. So we solved
16:08
communication. Communication is now much much faster or information. you know the internet, the rise of the digital
16:14
superighway, that sort of thing. This on that point, we have achieved super
16:21
abundance in certain aspects even today. Like long-distance minutes are no longer
16:28
a thing. There is a super abundance of our ability to communicate with anyone
16:33
anywhere in on earth in real time for free essentially, right? In fact, you could argue that we
16:39
we have become like the equivalent of obese because we have so much information. We're completely saturated
16:46
that we we end up anxious because we're always on. Um and there's there's far more digital
16:51
information than anyone can consume on any given day. So that is that is super abundance or hyperabundance. I want to
16:57
pin that because I think it'll be important for the later on in the conversation when we actually talk about what the age of abundance actually could
17:04
look like that we actually have right now examples of things that are truly super abundant
17:10
which at the time were scarce and therefore expensive and
17:16
complex and misunderstood and desired. So let's just pin that one for now.
17:22
Sorry. Let's let's go on. No worries. Yeah. Yeah. And so the the the the final point is that what we're
17:29
the the problem we're solving right now, the primary constraint is cognition or intelligence. So we're we're entering
17:36
into an era of cognitive hyperabundance. We solved thermal abundance. We solved
17:41
communication and information abundance. Now we're solving cognitive abundance. And one way to because that sounds
17:47
pretty abstract. So one way to understand this is ask yourself what's the optimal number of super geniuses in
17:53
the world? Is it five or or five million or five billion? Right? How many like
18:00
for anyone who's ever worked in a company or or looked at their government and said, "Wow, these people are idiots.
18:06
We need more intelligent people." Right? Um so that is kind of the problem that we're solving is is the bottleneck of
18:13
super intelligence or even just highly talented humans. Uh so the era of
18:18
cognitive hyperabundance is really kind of the project that humanity is on right now and it takes many forms right
18:24
there's artificial intelligence there's quantum computing there's simulations there's all kinds of ways that you can
18:30
solve this that some of them look more humanlike like humanoid robots some of them look less humanlike but they still
18:36
do things that humans either would take a long time to do with our brains or simply cannot do with our brains and so
18:43
that's kind of the the takeaway so the four modes of human h human's
18:48
contribution to productivity are being eroded and they're being eroded fast. So
18:55
let's talk about maybe let's move on to the part two uh of of part two is is
19:01
focused on the actual decline of labor. So can you sort of take us further and I would love if you
19:06
could add some sort of data and examples from from real world that you are aware
19:11
of to sort of strengthen your point. Yeah. So part two of the book is about
Decline of labor
19:17
the decline of labor which you can't by definition you cannot enter into a post-labor economic paradigm unless
19:23
labor goes away. Now to make that assertion you'd have to have evidence that labor is in fact declining or
19:31
eroding. And what I've actually found in my research is that the the turning
19:37
point in at least in America was around 1953. That's when prime age uh employment
19:44
peaked at about 98% for for men. So 98% of of prime ageed working men, working
19:52
age men were in the economy in 1953 and it has been declining ever since. It's
19:57
at about 89% today. Now that still sounds good. 89% is not catastrophic,
20:02
but it's not 98%. So that's the first fact. Another fact is that manufacturing
20:08
in America peaked in 1979 with about 21 million or 22 million uh employees.
20:16
Today just four and a half decades later the uh uh the manufacturing sector of
20:21
America employs half that number but it has six times the output or sorry three
20:27
times the output. Uh meaning that each each manh hour put in is six times more
20:32
productive. So this is the nature of automation is that with fewer people you become more productive until you don't
20:38
need people at all. So because one thing that many people kind of believe and
20:44
this is not entirely incorrect is that a lot of manufacturing jobs have gone overseas. Yeah. So you can say you can blame globalism,
20:50
you can blame offshoring, but even accounting for that MIT economist named
20:56
David or uh who coined the term in the in the 2010s the missing millions where
21:03
if looking at the productivity the American productivity of manufacturing,
21:08
you would expect it to employ millions more people than it does already. But you say, okay, well, when you account
21:15
for globalization and offshoring, where are these other jobs? And those other jobs were lost to automation. Now, you'd
21:24
say, okay, well, that's that's heavy. That's, you know, physical space. That's not uh you know, cognition. That's, you
21:29
know, that's you can you can make those claims. However, since the year 2000,
21:34
back office jobs have followed the same exact trajectory, but instead of 45 years, it's only taken 20 years. So back
21:42
office jobs are about half of what they used to be, but back office workers are much more productive than they've ever
21:49
been due to cloud automation and software as a service and now artificial intelligence. Uh and now it's eating
21:55
into developers. It's eating into lawyers. You know, we're eroding all of these different sectors. And so the the
22:03
long story short is when you look at the evidence, you say, "Okay, well wages are
22:08
still technically going up, but productivity has gone up way faster than wages, which is exactly what you'd
22:13
expect to see during the rise of automation." Now, there's another problem with this, and it's not just
22:19
that, you know, unemployment is still okay here in America. We're at about 4 to 5% right now. Total labor force
22:25
participation rate peaked in the year 2000 at about 66%. Now it's down to about 61%. Meaning some
22:32
people have just checked out of the economy permanently. And this is despite population growth due to uh births and
22:39
immigration. So the population is going up, the participation rate is going down and it's not really showing any signs of
22:46
reversing. It's not completely linear. There are some ups and downs like with the pandemic and that sort of thing, but more and more people are checking
22:52
out of the economy permanently. Now, to make matters worse is that this is we're
22:58
seeing an undermining of labor power. Globalization and offshoring undermines
23:03
the uh the the bargaining power that laborers have locally, but also policies
23:09
have undermined unions and other uh aspects of labor power. So, we're kind of at a at a lose-lose.
23:16
And so, when we when we talk about the decline of labor, there's kind of two components. We're seeing the decline of
23:22
the need for human labor, which is unequivocal across pretty much every sector and every domain. The need for
23:28
humans is declining, but also at the same time, labor's bargaining power is
23:33
also declining. So, this is the kind of the primary point of section two of the book is to show yes, automation is on
23:39
the rise and exactly as you'd expect, people are becoming more productive, therefore you need fewer people. It's
23:45
really that simple. But then there are many downstream effects from that uh observation. And the whole purpose
23:52
behind the post-labor economic movement is I think what you set up if you just
23:58
play the movie forward to its logical conclusion we might end up in a situation where there is full automation
24:05
of everything goods and services and that people who actually genuinely
24:12
want to work simply do not have ability to because they cannot pro provide any
24:18
economic value. glad. So we have to figure out a way to deal
24:23
with this uh during the transition that we are all already in so that we end up in the good
24:32
spot at the end of this as in that these increases in production and creation of new wealth that everybody projects will
24:39
happen benefit the whole society except instead of benefiting a micro percentile of of
24:46
the owners of those ultimate technologies. Right. Sure. Yeah. And one of the primary reasons for
Postlabor economic movement
24:52
that is that capital tends to uh uh concentrate over time. And as capital becomes more important, capital be gets
25:00
more capital. You know, as as the old saying goes, you have to have money to make money. Well, if you lose your job,
25:06
you don't have any money to participate in this new economy that we're building. Yeah. Now
25:12
that is not necessarily automatically a catastrophic thing because uh or many
25:19
people might not assume that it's automatically catastrophic and one of the reasons is because historically for
25:24
about the last century or so the primary role of the government has just been to
25:29
ensure that there is a fair enough labor market that you let the market sort it out. you say okay you know uh where
25:36
wherever there's demand for labor that'll be a price signal and people will train for that and so on and so
25:42
forth and that is that is the social contract that we've operated under which is that you have the right to work and
25:47
you have the right to work for any job for that that'll hire you but in the future thinking rationally
25:54
from the perspective of any business you say well I can use this piece of automation software or buy a robot or
26:00
lease a robot or whatever it is that you want to do or hire a Which one is going to be cheaper? Which
26:05
one is going to be better and faster? Which one is going to have the better bottom line for my company? And this is
26:10
the kind of cold calculation that every company makes. Do you hire someone internally? Do you hire out a
26:16
contractor? Do you uh use B2B and and and sub subcontract it out? Or do you
26:22
amateurize it over uh over capital? And so that is one of the primary uh
26:28
concerns that many people have which is that just the the iterative rational standpoint as technology gets better
26:34
because it always it's always inevitable eventually once technology can replace people it usually does uh in almost all
26:43
circumstances. There's a few exceptions here and there where we decided like no we want to have a human making some of
26:48
these decisions or you know uh a human signature underwriting certain things but even then in the long run businesses
26:56
make the rational decision and it's not just at the business level that these decisions are made it's at the national
27:01
level you actually have multiple multiple layers because how is one nation going
27:07
to compete with another if they're stuck in a more kind of lite mindset where they say well we have this automation
27:13
but we're not going to use it because then you just hand hand victory to whoever your competitors are on the on
27:19
the international stage. Absolutely. So So in other words, the the challenge that we have as a society
27:26
is in the fact that every every entity is going to be making its locally
27:32
rational decision. But when you compound these locally rational decisions and spread them
27:38
across the whole the whole economy, this could this could translate in a very
27:44
challenging situation. Right? It it could translate into challenging situation. And I think that what we've
27:49
spoken about already is that the pace of this change is so fast that we have
27:55
never experienced this level of disruption in this short amount of time.
28:01
And we don't yet know what's coming. like we are just at the opening salvos
28:06
of this transition. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So there's there's a
General purpose technologies
28:11
few dimensions to understand how fast it's coming and and what's coming and that sort of thing. So I mentioned
28:16
earlier artificial intelligence, humanoid robots, quantum computing, all of these things are general purpose
28:22
technologies. They're also automation technologies. Now when you look at the level of diffusion or saturation these
28:29
technologies that exist namely artificial starting with artificial intelligence uh are already in literally
28:35
every sector from education to military public private it's already there.
28:41
Y and then you combine that with the rate of capability expansion of these of these uh of these technologies. So one
28:48
of the one of the key characteristics of a general purpose technology is that they improve over time. So not only can
28:53
they be used in every sector, they improve uh not necessarily quickly, but they improve over time. But what we're
29:00
seeing is that it actually is improving very quickly, which means that you get to network effects where suddenly, you
29:06
know, whenever there's a new technology, business leaders might say, "Oh, well, I'll wait till it's cost effective or I'll wait till it's proven out." But as
29:14
the token cost of artificial intelligence goes down exponentially and its intelligence goes up exponentially
29:20
that that calculus is going to be crossed much sooner than many people realize. And it's already of course
29:26
crossed the calculus uh for many businesses who are already adopting artificial intelligence specifically
29:31
generative AI. I think last I checked uh and of the Forbes 500 20 to 30% are
29:38
officially using generative AI for something and that's expected to reach 70 to 80% within two or three years. Uh
29:44
and in those two or three years the tech the underlying technology will have improved pretty dramatically.
29:49
And I think that what you mentioned about both Google and open AI uh achieving gold medal in the math math
29:57
Olympiad which just happened a few days ago here. Here was for me a very very good
30:02
evidence of how fast this is coming and how surprisingly fast it actually is.
30:09
The poly market bet on whether AI will achieve the gold medal was at about 20 I
30:16
think 20 or 23% uh just a day before uh open AAI
30:21
announced that they did. So it went from 23% to to essentially 100%. Within a
30:28
matter of an hour as the announcement came, which tells me that even those who are following these
30:35
trends to the point that they're placing financial bets on it were shocked and
30:40
surprised. They were not expected. That was the that was the bet that that this
30:46
will be achieved this year and we are in July. So y I think that I I don't think
30:51
it is Um I don't think it's alarmist to say
30:56
this is coming at us much faster than people appreciate and understand and the
31:03
impact will be greater than people think it will be. We are in that in that mode,
31:08
right? Yeah, absolutely. Uh and you know, we've been making these promises for a while.
Machine labor
31:14
Many people their reaction is something like, "Ah, I've heard this before. The promises that computers and AI are going
31:20
to replace all work, you know, ever since the ' 60s or ' 80s. Uh you know, Marks and Kees, uh every economist has
31:27
predicted that machines will do all the labor eventually. Uh and they, well, it hasn't materialized yet. Um and we can
31:34
actually explain why there's actually more labor to be done despite what some of them predicted. And that is uh quite
31:41
simply as the as the the the domain expands in terms of what you are able to
31:47
do uh what you what kinds of goods and services you can provide at a lower price point then you suddenly realize
31:53
that that market demand. The iPhone is a perfect example. People had cell phones for many years before the iPhone, but
31:59
then you had a different kind of product that offered new dimensions to that service and then it materialized entire
32:06
new sectors, mobile apps and all the other services that are tied to your phones. I mean, even login now, you
32:14
know, you have menus that at at restaurants that you have to use your phone, you pay for things with your
32:19
phone. And so you have these these knock-on network effects that you know Markx and Keen didn't fully anticipate
32:26
but in hindsight we can understand them uh as as to why they ultimately did create more jobs. However, this time is
32:33
different because again what we see is the machines are already encroaching on literally every behavior that humans do
32:39
that add economic value. So if that continues for any length of time, the conclusion that you mentioned is one of
32:45
the most logical inevitable conclusions, which is that the marginal utility of humans drops below that of the machine.
32:51
It doesn't even have to drop to zero. Yeah. It's just that the machine has to be cheaper and better and faster than us, which that's what machines tend to do is
32:58
they become better, faster, cheaper, and smarter than us. Yeah. And then you don't hire humans anymore.
33:03
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So, so I think that like like we're now touching on this topic of power
33:09
um and property and the power that humans have in the economy and how is
33:15
this uh being attacked or eroding. I would love if we can maybe move on to
33:21
that topic. You've introduced just a moment ago this concept of better, faster, cheaper, safer.
33:28
um can you expand on it a little bit more and take us into into into part
33:34
three which is about the the power and property? Yeah, so we've got power and social contract and and so on and so forth. For
Power and social contract
33:42
most of human history, uh basically since we came up with the idea of of
33:47
economics and property, one of the primary ways that people contributed to society and also had power was by
33:54
contributing labor. uh you know you could always have uh labor revolts where people just refused to work the land
34:01
back when it was more uh agricultural. Uh then even during the rise of the
34:06
first, second and third industrial revolutions uh all productivity was still predicated on human uh human
34:12
effort or human input. Uh and so humans could always refuse to work and by refusing to work you seize up the
34:19
economy. uh and that is how uh many that's the fundamental social contract
34:25
uh that has allowed uh nations such as England to demand more and more democracy over time
34:31
uh which then spread to America and France and the rest of Europe uh because the idea was that you have to have
34:36
what's called a credible threat. So when you have the the masses or the proletariat or the ordinary citizens if
34:43
there is a credible threat that they are able to say you know what we want things to change. So there's one of the ways
34:50
that you can do that is with labor scarcity and labor scarcity happened naturally after the black plague or a
34:57
black death. Um so a third of Europeans died. Therefore there was a huge amount
35:03
of labor scarcity and suddenly all the peasants found that hey I have a lot more negotiating power. I have a lot
35:09
more bargaining power. Now what we see historically is that in places with labor gluts that doesn't
35:14
happen. So everywhere from Russia uh to ancient China, people were just seen as
35:20
kind of perennial crops where there was just always going to be so many people that you didn't really have to put a
35:25
high valuation on human life and human rights. And many of these places still struggle with that today. Look at the
35:31
way that Russia treats its soldiers. It treats them as disposable. Um so that's just an example as to where
35:37
labor scarcity uh actually paradoxically increased bargaining power. Now, as
35:44
machines become better, faster, cheaper, and safer than humans, labor scarcity doesn't ever happen again. Meaning that
35:51
the value of human life and the value of uh the nec the necessity of human labor inputs then drops perhaps permanently.
35:59
So if that's the case, if the entire social contract that we have that we have built that is based on you know
36:06
capitalism and democracy and all those things when you look at what actually came underneath those it was the
36:12
exchange of labor for uh for uh uh prosperity that's been breaking down
36:19
that promise that you exchange your your labor for one day you'll you'll be wealthy and things will get better. At
36:26
least for the younger generations, that has not proven to be true, which is why there's a lot of disaffected people. And
36:31
you typically see this. It comes in cycles, longer cycles throughout civilizations where something changes or
36:39
sometimes it's a new technology. Sometimes it's just that wealth concentrates over time, those kinds of
36:44
things. But then something has to break. And this gets to where and why I added
36:49
part three to the book which is about power, property, social contracts, is that many people are afraid that
36:56
something is going to have to give that they're that we're basically building up pressure and something's going to blow
37:02
out before too long. Um, if you look at the statistics right now, something like more than a third of
37:08
Americans expect a civil war and think that it's necessary. Uh, you don't get that level of anger unless something is
37:14
going wrong in society. and the fundamental promise of the American dream has been corroding for, you know,
37:21
the last several decades. Um, so I don't know where you want to go from there because I can talk about this for a long time. No, I think I think
37:28
it's really you are now I think that now we are touching the actual nerve of what
37:34
I think many people are sensing which is that labor in all of its forms from the
37:39
actual laborer on the field to those chief executive officer who exchange
37:45
their labor for their stock and shares and millions that everything is actually
37:50
being disrupted at the moment. even the upper ones perhaps even more disrupted
37:56
than the the the ones towards the sort of more simpler more more simpler more sort of u strengthbased dexterity based
38:03
types of work. So I think this this is now touching the nerve. So let's maybe talk a little bit about um about the
38:11
concept of how people generally generate income and how is this how does that
38:18
look today uh contrasting the income that's coming from wages versus income
38:24
that's coming from property versus income that is coming from governments and what do you feel is going to be the
38:32
shift there? Yeah. Yeah. This is this is a great question and so uh the the fundamental
Household income breakdown
38:39
thing to understand here is that household income aggregate household income comes from three overarching
38:45
buckets three big buckets. So number one is wages from labor. Uh so that's your
38:51
job or you know if you're a soloreneur like I am then you know the various contracts and other things that you
38:56
have. Uh the second bucket is from property. So that is rental properties, stocks, bonds, those sorts of things. uh
39:03
businesses that you might own. Uh and then the third bucket is government transfers. So this is things like SNAP
39:10
or retirement or Medicaid, those sorts of things. Any money social social supports. Yeah.
39:15
Exactly. Yeah. Any any money or value that you get directly from the government is considered a transfer.
39:20
Anything that you're entitled to because you own the property, that's, you know, property based income. And then wages.
39:26
Now, when you look at it all broken out, it's about um 60 to 70%. It varies from
39:33
nation to nation, but in any developed nation, it's about 60 to 70% wages. And
39:38
then the other two are usually about split in half, although it's a little bit more in nations like Germany where
39:44
there's a little bit more of a welfare state um and and less of a property base. But in America, it's about even
39:49
between property based income and transfers. Now, let's say 60 wages, 60%. This is average
39:58
family income. Yep. across the whole population comes
40:03
from three sources. 60% comes from wages, people exchanging labor for for
40:09
for money. 20% is let's call it passive income. So
40:14
you're not directly working for it. Your property works for you as in you've got
40:20
stocks and stocks pay dividend. All stocks increase in price and you sell them and you achieve profit and or you
40:27
have rental properties or you have vending machines, right? They work they so that's about 20%. And
40:36
then you the remaining 20% is what government transfers to help people
40:43
welfare social services and other transfers. So it's 60 2020.
40:48
Yep. That's about the breakdown for America. Yeah. And we spend the first 30 minutes describing how this 60 is now it's under
40:56
attack. It's actually being displaced. Yes. Right. Yeah. So labor share of income. So one
Labor share of income
41:04
way that you can break down if you look at the entire economy like all all income made if you break it down into a
41:10
pie chart labor share labor's share of income has decreased from I think the peak was about 56% 50 years ago to it's
41:18
about uh just over 52% today globally. So it's declined 4% in the last few
41:24
decades. And again, that doesn't sound like much, but we're getting to the point where less than half of all income
41:30
is going to be based on labor before too long. So, if you lose the not just, you
41:36
know, everyone has the right to work, but if you lose the ability to work because nobody will hire you, then your
41:42
economic agency will will continue to go down. And if you and if you say, "Well,
41:47
I refuse to work," business owners, capital owners are going to say, "Well, we'll just find a robot that'll that can
41:53
do it instead, or we'll find an AI that can do it instead." That will be a viable option here uh in the coming
42:00
years. And that's the most rational choice. Um you know, it might sound like I'm vilifying business owners. I'm
42:05
actually very much on business I'm on I'm on business's side and I'm on the citizen side because I want businesses
42:11
to automate everything. That's how we get to the future is we want them to automate everything. That is their job is it's you know I want them to get to
42:18
zero employees if they can. That's the challenge to to businesses. But at the same time that deprivives us
42:25
citizens of one of our primary levers of power which is the ability to work to or
42:30
to withhold work uh as a way of getting what we need. And then we're we're reduced to just democratic rights. But
42:37
of course without a credible threat of you know forcing something to get your way then what do you do? We kind of run
42:44
out of levers of power. Uh and that's one of the reasons that I'm this is to me I want to emphasize this because this
42:50
is the this is the the the darkest hour of post labor economics is if we end up
42:56
in a situation where there is not a redistribution or predistribution of not just the wealth and prosperity but a
43:03
reallocation of civic power we could end up in a place where many people are kind
43:09
of you know left left in the lurch for quite a long time kind of like Engles
43:14
paws back in uh in England in the early 19th century. And I don't know about
43:20
you, but looking forward to 60 or 70 years of decreasing prosperity and
43:26
decreasing hope, that's not something that I really would look forward to. So, if we can find a way around that, uh
43:34
then that would be ideal. And of course, you know, there's the the wealth and prosperity itself. Automation is going
43:40
to generate more wealth and prosperity than we know what to do with. That's not actually the problem. The primary
43:45
problem is allocation and distribution. Yeah. So and and because then you say
43:51
well right now we distribute wealth and prosperity and the the primary signal that you use is property and labor.
43:59
But if we lose labor then only property matters in the future. Correct. And so if you don't have any property going in, you're kind
44:06
of up the creek without a paddle. This is what a lot of people are worried about. Correct. So that's that's kind of the fundamental
44:12
thing. And then even worse, if we don't have a lever of power to say make it go
44:17
our way other than our vote. Now voting is a good lever of power in a functioning democracy. The concern
44:24
though is that if laborers don't matter to the state, then voting power is also going to erode. So then you end up in
44:31
this this multi-dimensional kind of race condition where you lost labor power and
44:36
you're losing more labor power and the government is even more just focusing on those that are economically productive
44:42
which is the owners of capital. So then what happens to most citizens and then so you end up in this quagmire this this
44:49
kind of death spiral where the economy shuts down uh the civic fabric also
44:54
shuts down and we really just want to avoid that. And this sounds this sounds uh fantastical but it's actually
45:00
happened a few times in the last century uh with the Chinese great leap forward with the dissolution of the Soviet Union
45:07
we have seen nations fundamentally implode because their social contract
45:13
was was ruptured eroded yeah and this yeah so so this is actually superbly important and part of
45:20
the reason why I wanted to have this conversation on my platform is to actually raise this question and and
45:27
compel those who might be listening to this conversation, but specifically
45:32
industry leaders, shareholders, owners, and policy makers that this conversation
45:38
needs to be happening and that that the community that is emerging around around
45:44
post- labor economy is actually coming up with proposed solutions and frameworks that should help through.
45:51
We'll touch on them soon. But yes, before we go there, you mentioned something important, economic agency.
45:58
Would you be so kind to explain what you mean by economic agency and what do you feel economic agency consists of?
Economic agency
46:07
Yeah. So the the definition there's there's a few definitions of economic agency, but the simplest one that I
46:12
prefer is just someone's ability to influence their economic fate. And that
46:17
is, you know, there's there's kind of a few primary pillars. So number one is excuse me uh labor rights. So the right
46:24
to work. Uh next is property rights which is the ability to own and and have that property respected uh by by society
46:31
and by the state and enforced by the state. And then democratic rights which is the ability to influence the
46:37
government itself. So those are kind of the three pillars of economic agency which there's many many downstream
46:42
effects from that. So for instance um I know that my bank account is safe because of all the regulations and so
46:48
part of the social contract there is that the state has regulations that ensures that my bank will behave and if
46:54
they don't if they misbehave then my my bank account is insured by the government. So, that's an example of of
47:00
some of the security. Um, all of my investments there. I know that the that every time I make an investment through
47:05
my stock broker, the SEC has inspected and crossed all the dies eyes and dotted
47:10
the tees to ensure that what I'm investing in is a real asset and that if something goes sideways, I'll know about
47:16
it. So, those are examples of of how the state can actually shore up my economic
47:21
agency. Now, the state takes a more passive role in a lot of these things. It's not giving me anything. It's saying
47:28
I'm giving you the opportunity. I'm giving you a a sandbox that you can play in. Uh but in the case where you know
47:36
one of the games that we play which is the labor market if that game completely dries up then the only market remaining
47:42
is democ uh democratic involvement and then property involvement. So then you
47:48
know you you've lost and you have just you have just described out of these three labor one is being under under
47:58
well I'm not saying it's in inappropriate to say under attack. It's not under the labor is being decoupled
48:04
from production and therefore your labor rights are
48:09
steadily and if we play the movie forward are going to be decreasing to the point that at some point in the
48:16
future it might not be relevant. your property rights are firm and in
48:21
place and then your democratic rights we discussed it also and I don't want to fold my finger because that's what end
48:28
you know that's what we end up with right so we have to therefore we have to
48:34
therefore deal with the fact that the labor uh part of our economic rights is
48:39
decreasing by either strengthening our property tower property rights
48:47
protecting democratic rights But also perhaps inventing the fourth
48:52
pillar. Yes. Yeah. So, you know, one way to think of it is is a chair can't stand
Fourth Pillar
48:58
with three legs, right? If it only if it only has two legs, a chair falls over. So, one possibility, and this is
49:04
something that I'm exploring, and and it's by the way, it's not just what I'm exploring. There's uh nations exploring
49:09
this and and plenty of people in the web 3 and crypto space is what about algorithmic rights or data rights? uh
49:16
which is another way of creating um a lever of power. Now, it's not a one-sizefits-all lever, right? It's not
49:23
what some people promise that, you know, blockchain is going to upend society and change everything. But when you look at
49:30
the characteristics of labor, it's individualized. It's uh it's um it's
49:35
unal inalienable from the human body. There's a there's many characteristics
49:40
that mean that labor is kind of unique in terms of how it creates power.
49:46
Then when you look at blockchain and crypto and those sorts ofies, they're
49:51
interesting because they're decentralized. They're permissionless, which is really important. Um, and
49:57
they're unstoppable, meaning you really can't shut them down. So, if you're trying to create a
50:02
platform or an ecosystem that allows for collective bargaining or collective power, those are some of the best
50:09
technologies. And so one of the hypotheses that I had and that I've been looking for for evidence for is that
50:15
maybe this set of technologies and I don't when I say cryptocurrency I don't mean like just Bitcoin right there's
50:22
central banking digital currencies as an option there's blockchain more broadly
50:27
um could actually replace or or help shore up labor power. Now what I found
50:33
is you know for anyone who's who is in the space there's what's called a decentralized autonomous organization
50:39
which is essentially a blockchain based company that is permissionless and all the resources and governance of that
50:46
company are uh managed on the chain uh that's the lingo for saying that you
50:51
know you use quadratic voting and you use soulbound tokens and sort those sorts of things to say I have a stake in
50:57
this company so that's uh decentralized autonomous organizations or Dows.
51:03
They're now legal in Wisconsin. They're also they've been legalized in I think Switzerland. I think Switzerland was the
51:09
first nation that legalized them nationally at the federal level. But there's other uses for blockchain
51:15
technology. So, one is Estonia. They actually have a direct democracy based
51:21
on blockchain technology. And you might say, well, what what's so special about blockchain? It's transparent and it's
51:26
immutable. Um, so those are two two characteristics that actually are kind of the antithesis of corruption because
51:32
as they say, sunlight is the best disinfectant. Well, if you have a blockchain that everyone can scrutinize,
51:39
then there is no there is no opacity to uh democratic decisions. Georgia, the
51:44
nation has also done the same thing where they put their land registry deeds on a blockchain. Uh, and that's another
51:50
thing. So, it's you know who owns what property. uh and that allows that allows for a lot more resilience so that
51:56
everyone knows who owns what uh and this prevents uh corruption and those sorts
52:01
of things. And those are just two very small examples. Another third example is that the EU is triing uh what's called
52:09
SSI which is self-s sovereign identification. So rather than rather
52:14
than some state issuing saying you know this is your EU passport or this is your
52:20
you know my in my case North Carolina driver's license where a state authority says your identity has been verified.
52:27
It's allowing people to own their own identity which again is another form of power because information is a is a very
52:34
powerful form of power. So those are just some examples as to how we might build a new social contract at least in
52:41
part on the back of technologies like blockchain and crypto.
52:47
This is this is very very interesting. um that that introduction of the fourth
52:52
pillar I think could be absolutely transformational and and revolutionary and give people an element of comfort
53:00
that you know there there there is there there are ways to supplement what we feel I think
53:08
generally the other two pillars of of labor and democracy being being gradually eroded.
53:15
U so David I'd love to move us now from statement of the issue and we've been
53:20
now stating the issue for the first 50 minutes of this identifying the concern right u to
53:28
so now what what do we do what what are the ideas models frameworks solutions
53:35
that are emerging now I've been following you and your work and we've been sort of discussing and and and and
53:41
pinging and communicating I know that there is a framework that you're propo proposing of multiple layers that that
53:48
add up to a potential solution. Can you share a little bit more or a lot more?
53:55
Yeah. Yeah. So there's there's there's a few parts of the next next uh part of the framework. So first is what do you
54:02
measure? Anytime that you're looking at a big uh systemic level problem like
54:08
this, you have to have the right measurements. things like GDP, Jenny coefficient, those are those are good
54:13
starts, but they're not necessarily uh the beall endall. So we can talk about measurements. Then there is prosperity.
54:20
So there's uh redistribution and predistribution of prosperity, which is what actual policies do you put in place
54:27
so that people can participate in this new economy. And then finally there is the reallocation of power. So there's
54:34
different measurements and interventions at each of those levels. And also there are different uh different uh
54:40
considerations depending on what scope you're looking at. So for instance, if you're you know if you're a town or a
54:46
county or a city that is looking at what do we do about you know decline of labor or if you're a state or region or
54:53
province or federal government or an international alliance even. So there's different levels of concern and
54:59
different levels of granularity of interventions and measurements. Uh so it's a it's it's a relatively large body
55:06
of knowledge and evidence but fortunately the the biggest thing is the closer that I looked the more I realized
55:12
that lots and lots of people are trying all kinds of things already. Uh so for instance um my home state of North
55:18
Carolina has the um has a a county uh what is it county economic performance dashboard. Um, Argon National Labs has
55:25
created a the CI uh county economic performance index uh just as a couple of
55:31
examples as to what they're measuring. Um, and m much much of the data that many nations already collect is already
55:38
uh there's there's a lot of hidden wisdom and insights in that data. So for instance the idea of what we talked
55:45
about earlier which is measuring u wage versus property versus transfers that's
55:50
already measured that's already the data is already collected so we don't have to invent anything new there it was it was
55:56
actually kind of amusing the first time I proposed that a think tank said that what I was proposing was feminist
56:01
Marxist nonsense and I'm like the federal government's already collecting this data um so I don't know what you're
56:06
talking about um but but that underscores the point that when you talk about some of these things that feels too knew and a lot of people kind of
56:13
have knee-jerk negative reactions. So that which Yeah, go ahead. I was going to say this is I think
56:19
actually very important to to mention that um like a lot of push back that I
56:24
would anticipate would be saying oh this is you know communism or socialism repackaged. Um I am a capitalist as it
56:32
gets like I and I know so are you. The idea here is to actually avoid that. To
56:38
actually avoid that. To not put the population at the whim
56:44
and control of governments, but instead to empower population with property
56:51
rights and other means that will ultimately supplement their labor to the point that they can
56:58
continue living a quality life with future that is brighter still.
57:04
Yes. So this is not about how do we get you know universal basic income so that nobody needs to work. This is about how
57:11
do we create a portfolio that will allow you to see the future and be happy and
57:17
excited about it because you know what's at the end of this transition is truly the stage of you know hyperabundance of
57:24
goods and services right yes y so to to differentiate between you
Communism vs Socialism
57:30
know communism socialism Marxism many people use those interchangeably one of the things that they all have in common
57:36
is that it is the government runs everything right it's government property property or collectively owned everything. Um, and and that creates a
57:44
situation where people are even more disempowered. Um, and the reason so there's there's plenty of reasons that
57:50
you want to avoid that first
57:57
or in the state, they end up abusing that power. No matter what their original intentions were, um, when you
58:03
say, well, the state the state knows best, um, it it never go uh pans out
58:09
that way. So first and foremost, second you lose a lot of information uh you know the free market whether it's a
58:14
labor market or or a market of goods and services that creates a lot of information. So there you have
58:20
everything from price signals which tells you what to produce where it tells you who's being more productive and less
58:25
productive and those sorts of things. So you want to preserve as many market-based solutions as possible
58:31
as labor declines because right now the labor market is one of the biggest components of the economy. So even if
58:38
you want to preserve free market economics as most of us do, you still need to anticipate, okay, what happens
58:44
when labor is only 30% of the economy instead of 70 to 80% of the economy because labor like some labor will stick
58:50
around. That's one thing we could maybe circle back to at the end is what what kind of jobs are going to stick around.
58:56
But the short version is that automation is destroying jobs faster than new jobs are being created. Um so if we want to
59:03
reconcile with that future we need to say okay one of the constraints is that we want to have market-based
59:09
capitalismfriendly solutions not centralized solutions important you don't want to yeah that's very
59:15
important you don't want to put all your eggs in one basket every time you become completely dependent on the government
59:20
and you have no agency because going back to the idea of economic agency if all that you have is an allowance from
59:26
the government that is no way to live right like sure you can probably subsist on that and there are plenty of people
59:32
in my audience that that do because they're on disability or retirement or pensions or that sort of thing. So I
59:39
don't want to I don't want to um I don't want to you know talk down to anyone who who is living in that kind of situation
59:45
but I think they would also be the first to agree they don't really have a way of particip
59:51
wealthy enough to have stocks and bonds and property and those sorts of things. This is the point that people might not
59:57
be able to participate even if they truly want to. Like when you have a
1:00:03
professional who has spent 30 years building a career to do some expert
1:00:09
special thing that is based on their knowledge and experience and and then
1:00:14
suddenly that gets displaced by a solution that costs $19.99 a month to
1:00:19
subscribe to that person wants to participate but they might not have the opportunity. So to me that is really
1:00:25
that that is what we need to solve for but in an open market
1:00:30
mechanism. Yep. And I'm looking for let me see if I can bring it up. Um I think you have it
1:00:36
the uh the pyramid graphic. Um I can't find it right off the top of my head. I do but I I don't I don't have I don't
1:00:44
have a handy version to share it. So what we're going to do is I can either describe it as you look for a for a
1:00:50
diagram but essentially the concept here is that there are multiple layers of uh
1:00:56
future income sources that we need to all be thinking of and I think this actually applies to everybody from the
1:01:03
individual and their families ultimately to you know communities regions
1:01:09
provinces states and ultimately nations. Yep. So, so
1:01:15
I'm not able to find the the the the graphic but the idea let's talk let's talk about yeah we we can talk about it. So when
1:01:22
when you say like earlier you used the word portfolio I think portfolio is the best term. So you know yes one of the
1:01:29
things that I say is we probably will want some sort of guaranteed income or basic income. Um it's probably not going
1:01:35
to be like the the universal high income that some people like Elon Musk talk about. Um I gave a talk at a university
1:01:42
and and you know one of the students asked me like what if we get a universal basic income and I said well you know
1:01:47
because he's like why you know why would I work if I have that? I was like well what does basic income mean to you? How much what's the dollar amount? He said
1:01:53
$5,000 a month. I said that's not a basic income. That's that's that that that's a that's more than some people
1:01:59
make today. Um so we're not talking about that. When you when you talk about universal basic income or guaranteed
1:02:04
income programs, usually the pilots are between $200 and $500. uh which is not
1:02:10
enough to pay rent. That's, you know, if if all you do is feed yourself, that's, you know, that can that can feed you and
1:02:16
a couple other people if you're if you're very economical about it, but it's not going to pay rent. It's not going to pay tuition, those sorts of
1:02:22
things. We might you might argue for a slightly higher universal basic income. But the point there is that that forms
1:02:28
the foundation of the pyramid, uh, where everyone gets it. So, everyone has at least a little bit of of, uh, money
1:02:35
transferred to them from the government. So, there's a couple ways you can do this. You can tax and redistribute. You can do helicopter money, which is you
1:02:41
just print money and give it to people. Um, but people can argue about the specifics, but someone's got to pay for
1:02:47
it because if you don't take money out of circulation, then you're going to end up with inflation, uh, which devalues
1:02:53
everyone's money when that's no good. So, I was going to say as you described is that immediately popped into my mind.
1:02:59
Of course, printing money drives inflation. So, that would be a major risk. You also mentioned uh taxation.
1:03:08
I think maybe we should just pause here for a second and explore this a little bit further because I know that UBI is a
1:03:14
big it's it's a it's a topic that is talked about now and there are strong
1:03:19
views for and against. I would love to get your thinking about how would a nation potentially source
1:03:27
funding to fund universal basic income. So if you can address that and the
1:03:33
second thing that I would like to ask you in that context is printing money of course raises the inflation but
1:03:42
automation and technology is deflationary. So is there a scenario where these two
1:03:47
forces end up in an elegant equilibrium while providing universal basic income
1:03:55
at least during this transition phase which might be the next three five seven 10 years. Yeah I you know I I've thought
1:04:03
about that and and one possibility is that if we if we see because automation is deflationary through multiple
1:04:10
measurements. Let me let me just start there is that first and foremost automation makes goods and services
1:04:15
cheaper. That's why we do it. That's why we use technology is because it makes things you know better, faster, cheaper,
1:04:20
safer. Um now another reason that automation particularly artificial intelligence and robots could be
1:04:26
deflationary is because it can cause people to lose their jobs. Uh people having less spending money is still
1:04:32
deflationary. That's you know there there's any any number of ways to achieve it. So less purchasing power
1:04:40
means that um rather than the value of the money that you have going down uh in your bank account, it'll start to go up
1:04:46
because less people have money. So law of supply and demand, as demand drops,
1:04:52
um then price drops. Yeah. Yeah. So it's it's it's pretty it's
1:04:57
pretty straightforward. So, I could imagine a situation where if we start to see a a deflationary regime take over um
1:05:06
that governments start to issue stimulus checks again because we know we can predict the amount of inflation that
1:05:12
they that they create. So, if you end up with a uh regime that's too deflationary, you might just inject
1:05:18
money directly into the economy. Now, what people would probably prefer is something more regular. Uh so then to to
1:05:25
your the second part of your question which is how do you fund such a thing? This is going to be a little bit more
1:05:32
difficult because most basic income programs have been either at the local or state level and they've also been
1:05:39
very narrowly funded. So you're talking about sometimes it's you know a few dozen families or a few hundred families
1:05:44
are given basic income. Not every family in a region. So we're not really we we
1:05:50
haven't done an experiment yet on a large enough scale to see where does this money come from. Uh now the obvious
1:05:57
thing is well if those who own the capital which is the robots and data centers and AIs and all the big tech
1:06:04
companies where they're getting the most money um you know maybe a robot tax is a way to go uh or just taxing wealth in
1:06:11
general. Um, some people have prop have proposed a very modest like 0.5% wealth
1:06:17
tax on any account over a million dollars or over a billion dollars or whatever you want to say. Um, the idea
1:06:23
there is that you you put a very very small tax on on the the the
1:06:30
largest concentrations of wealth and that'll help inject some of that that more or less stagnant money back into
1:06:36
the economy. Um, that's a proposed solution. Uh, so there's there's plenty of ways to to do it, but what I said
1:06:43
earlier is that creating the wealth is not going to be the problem there. We're we're about to hit a tipping point of
1:06:49
solar, nuclear fusion is on the horizon, artificial intelligence, robots. We're going to have more prosperity and wealth
1:06:56
than we know what to do with. It's just what are the little systemic changes that we make so that it circulates.
1:07:02
Bingo. This is, I think, very very important thing to stress. Uh I I I
1:07:09
agree with you. I think all the indications are that we are upon a
1:07:14
productivity and prosperity um
1:07:20
I don't know what I don't know golden age I don't know how to describe it but
1:07:25
that because of the automation everything is going to be faster cheaper better safer easier to produce and we
1:07:33
are going to be accumulating as a society a lot of prosperity and wealth
1:07:40
The problem is though that a lot of that wealth will be generated at the same
1:07:45
time as the curve of the employment goes down. Right? So we will have a window of
1:07:50
opportunity while that additional wealth is
1:07:55
generated to figure out how to keep the society ticking and how to avoid what
1:08:02
could be an what could be a catastrophe that like you described what happened in
1:08:07
China. You described what happened in in in Soviet Union after the collapse of Soviet Union. If we don't do this
1:08:15
systematically and smartly and wisely, we could end up in a situation where all
1:08:20
of that wealth has acred to a small percentage of owners
1:08:26
with 90% of others who are not no longer able to participate. So we have to
1:08:32
figure this window very very quickly and hence the urgency for me of this conversation
1:08:38
this window. So let let me make this maybe even more real. I believe that
1:08:44
most organizations explicitly or implicitly are in the process of figuring out their own business case
1:08:50
about what do we do about this and our you know new hiring policies but also
1:08:56
what do we do with the people that we already have. So imagine what happens when all these business cases get acted
1:09:02
on next year for example, right? We might we might be under very very
1:09:08
significant pressure in the system much faster than than than than than I think most
1:09:16
people think. And to me this is really the the the reason why I'm I want to be raising this conversation because
1:09:22
because we need to be solving this now. Yes. Yeah. So to to get back to the
1:09:27
pyramid idea, I just I just jotted jotted it down since I couldn't find it. So UBI could be the foundation.
1:09:33
Let's say that's the foundation. Yeah. Everyone gets a couple hundred dollars a month probably in an ideal world from
1:09:40
the federal government, from their state, and from their city. So that so that if you're in a more productive city
1:09:45
or state, you get even more, you know, guaranteed income or basic income. So you end up with a portfolio of transfers
1:09:52
or you know probably monthly checks that you get from the government. The next
1:09:58
layer could be what some people are calling universal basic capital. Um so the Trump administration just created
1:10:04
baby bonds uh where every for every child that's born they get uh they get a $1,000. Um I don't think it's it's not
1:10:12
been implemented yet. It's just a trial. So I don't want to get people too excited. But the idea is that for for
1:10:17
every child that's born, they get uh $1,000 and I think it's in a S&P 500
1:10:22
index fund um is is the proposal. So that's an example of just basic capital
1:10:28
where the government just says, you know what, instead of giving you money, let's give you let's just give you a chunk of the pie, right? Let's just give you some
1:10:35
stocks and bonds right off the bat. Uh so that can be done for children, it can be done for adults. Um there's there's
1:10:42
other ways that you can look at that, but the idea is is that you have some level of private ownership that is just
1:10:48
guaranteed by your government. And again, there's no reason that that only has to be done at the federal level. It can be done at the state, regional, and
1:10:54
local. So these are so so let's let's imagine the py well as I have the
1:11:00
pyramid written down, but so the universal basic income is the bottom layer. And the idea is that universal
1:11:06
basic imp your your genuine essentials for
1:11:13
survival as in your food and like that's the basis of Maslo hierarchy and then you know we can cl
1:11:19
become we can now be intellectually climbing up the maslo hierarchy of economic agency. Next level up what
1:11:26
you're describing is called public wealth fund dividends.
1:11:32
Yes. And what you're describing essentially is uh an equivalent of
1:11:37
sovereign wealth funds, regional wealth funds, municipal and local wealth funds
1:11:45
where corporations uh whether they're you know nonprofit or
1:11:50
whatever types of corporations exist and citizens who live in that region, in
1:11:56
that state, in that nation uh participate as owners, co-owners of at
1:12:02
public wealth. Is that the idea? Yeah. So, wealth funds um so there
1:12:08
there's there's rural wealth funds, there's municipal wealth funds, there's sovereign wealth funds. None of these are new. They exist all over uh in
1:12:16
various formats. Uh many of them are tied to natural resources. Not all of them. You can treat them like an endowment where it's basically an
1:12:23
account that owns stocks and bonds and the dividends and proceeds from that are used generally to pay for the government
1:12:29
or to pay for services that the government provides. Um so then you get you know things like transportation and
1:12:35
health care um that is effectively it's free to you. Um but then it the the cost
1:12:41
is defrayed by that wealth fund. In other cases, you can have dispersements from those wealth funds like the Alaska
1:12:48
Permanent Fund, which dis uh distributes about $1,700 a year to citizens of Alaska uh based on oil income. Now, if
1:12:56
we're trying to get away from oil, then that might not last forever. So, we'd want a little bit more diversification in our portfolio.
1:13:02
There's nothing magical there. Um but yes, so wealth funds as a way of having collectively owned capital. Now, the
1:13:09
custodianship of those funds is important. um every time you have a huge
1:13:15
amount of wealth that's concentrated in one place, it becomes a target for corruption and manipulation and
1:13:20
exploitation. So transparency, good governance, democratic rights and democratic institutions are really
1:13:27
important to have those which is one way that you can circumvent that is by going to more private sector. So that's why
1:13:34
the other layers of the pyramid are private sectors. Yes. So let's talk about the third layer. So,
1:13:39
so the third layer you called collectively owned private assets.
1:13:45
So, that is now the third layer that builds on top of these first two. So, help explain what you mean by
1:13:52
collectively owned private assets as well as by the way I I'm I recognize
1:13:57
what you said. Everything you're going to talk about pretty much exists somewhere has been tried and piloted
1:14:05
somewhere. So none of this so far is none of it's magic. None of it is magic, right? But let's
1:14:11
let's build the pyramid to the next level. What is the next layer? Collectively owned private assets. What
1:14:16
do you mean by that? Yeah. So this is things like trusts, um employeeowned companies, cooperatives,
1:14:23
that that sort of thing. Again, none of it is new. Uh but the idea is that you create you uh we would overhaul our
1:14:31
legal frameworks. So for instance, Wisconsin that's allowing Dows, decentralized autonomous organizations,
1:14:37
that can be an example of an entity that people just uh spin up and that that
1:14:42
entity then owns assets whether it is real estate, whether it is code
1:14:49
happens to be. Um again, we're not reinventing the wheel here. We're just saying, hey, let's put this in a framework.
1:14:55
So collectively owned private property. Um it can that can be uh land trusts. So
1:15:01
that's a that's a common one where you own farmland or forest land uh those sorts of things. Um, yeah, there's
1:15:08
nothing there's nothing particularly special about it, but it can be legally or it can be financially prohibitive to
1:15:14
create these things and what you can do with them can be difficult, which is why it's included in the framework is
1:15:20
because what we want to do is not necessarily have the government say, "Hey, like yes, we can hand out
1:15:25
universal basic income and universal basic capital and and establish sovereign wealth funds, but then you
1:15:31
also want to create a new segment of the free market that says, hey, let's have you guys work together because
1:15:36
collectively you're smarter than the government. I I I agree. I agree. And so when I
1:15:44
think about collectively owned private assets in addition to what you just described, most of us actually as we
1:15:50
participate as we just participate in the economy, we frequent various brands
1:15:57
and stores and we get loyalty cards and we get you know we we get sort of recognition that way and companies are
1:16:04
sort of attracting us to become their customers. I can absolutely see a model where you know loyalty concept is
1:16:10
translated into fractional ownership concept. Y so that you know the company that I
1:16:16
frequent ensures my consistency by you know
1:16:21
translating my purchases into a microractional ownership of the company itself plus shared shared ownership
1:16:30
companies employeeowned companies or proliferation of equitybased
1:16:36
compensation to the people before automation takes over. Right? So how do
1:16:42
you create an organization that will compel the best best employees to work for it because they are all getting
1:16:47
equity knowing that at some point 5 years out 10 years out this enterprise
1:16:52
is going to be fully automated but I'm fine because I have a unit or I have a share but that's the idea. So to me what is
1:17:00
really important to emphasize is that industry champions, industry leaders,
1:17:05
owners of businesses, this layer is the layer that you need to contribute and participate and figure out what works
1:17:12
for you and what will work for your customers and for your employees. This is the point. The bottom two layers are
1:17:20
mostly driven by public sector and policy makers. This middle layer is actually driven by industry champions
1:17:27
and owners. Yes. And and one one of the So, first
1:17:33
and foremost, we have to also give let's give some concrete examples so that it doesn't sound alien. Um, REI, successful
1:17:40
outdoor company. Um, they're they're a they're a cooperative. So, if you're a member, you get dividends from based on
1:17:47
your purchases at the company. Uh, many credit cards give you cash back and they give you points. That's that's another
1:17:53
example of this program. Um, airlines give you uh frequent flyer miles. all
1:17:58
kind of equity uh not necessarily equity but those are those are loyalty programs that show that if you give customers you
1:18:05
know a stake they tend to become more loyal customers none none of that again we're not
1:18:11
reinventing the wheel at all with any of these ideas just kind of codifying and systemat systematizing it to show hey
1:18:17
this is actually possible uh ESOP so employee stock option plans uh is another good thing that that uh pretty
1:18:24
much any private company any for-profit company could Um, studies often usually show that
1:18:32
employee-owned cooperatives, the the employees tend to outperform uh because
1:18:37
they're more invested knowing that they're going to get uh better returns. Um, certainly at companies where I've
1:18:43
worked in the past where they had a stock option plan, it felt really good. you know, it's like, hey, 10 or 15% of
1:18:49
my income, it comes in company shares, and I know that I get them at a at a discount because those shares were at
1:18:55
the, you know, cheapest uh I get I get basically get an automatic purchase of those shares at the cheapest that they
1:19:01
were during that that pay period. Um, and then usually at a little bit of a discount before that. So, hey, my
1:19:06
success is based on the company. So, every time the company is spending money, I'm thinking about, hey, this might come out of my my uh my shares.
1:19:13
Um, that sort of thing. So, those are all examples of collectively owned private property or private assets. It's
1:19:20
not necessarily, you know, put it on a blockchain and and it's going to be a decentralized autonomous organization or
1:19:26
a new memecoin that's that's out there. Many people in the web 3 and crypto space immediately default to those kind
1:19:32
of more imaginary uh assets, but we're talking about very concrete brickandmortar real assets. Th this in
1:19:40
other words this has to work for an average Joe and Jane.
1:19:46
Yes. For people who find themselves in the middle of this tornado and are not
1:19:51
themselves, you know, entrepreneurial in nature or just normal people with normal
1:19:57
families that have to feed. This has to work for them, right? So, thank you for automatic.
1:20:02
It has to be automatic and it has to work for them. Um so now we said
1:20:08
UBI layer, publicly owned wellund layer, collectively owned private property
1:20:15
layer and then there are still two more layers to go. There is your
1:20:20
your personal property and then what you call residual wages.
1:20:26
Yes. And I'm I'm I'm putting residual emphasis here on the residual. So let's
1:20:31
talk about private privately accumulated assets as the fourth
1:20:37
u layer of the of the pyramid. Yeah. So this is this is very conventional. This is your rental
1:20:43
properties, your stocks and bonds and any companies that you own. Not really a whole lot changes there. Uh but the idea
1:20:50
is that the bottom three layers create a more solid foundation allowing you to
1:20:55
accumulate more private property. Whether that is, you know, you buy a rental um or a time share or stocks and
1:21:02
bonds and those sorts of things because if you if you create that that safety net which is based on, you know, uh some
1:21:09
some redistribution but then also collective ownership and collective safety then that gives people that
1:21:15
baseline security. And one of the things that that we can do just as an example from a from a government perspective is
1:21:21
we could do a dollar matching program. Um, you know, many people have had 401ks where your where your employer will
1:21:27
match the first 5% or I think the most that I had was up to 11%. It was a really great company that I worked with
1:21:34
where you do it where the government might do a dollar matching program for every qualified investment that you make, they will match it as long as you
1:21:40
hold it for more than a year or two or you know, whatever the the rule might happens to be. So we can incentivize
1:21:46
people to accumulate wealth because if we're if we are if we all collectively decide that we're moving to a property
1:21:53
based future where we need to broaden property ownership in order for the economy to continue going well you just
1:22:00
subsidize it and you subsidize it with tax code which is that's how we that's how we encourage people to buy homes. Yeah. Right. It's all your homeowners
1:22:07
insurance and your interest that's tax deductible. So that actually comes off of your your mortgage rather than paying
1:22:13
rent. So if you want people to invest in property, you just make it easier and you incentivize it through those schemes
1:22:20
such as tax breaks and dollar matching schemes and those sorts of things. Um and over time with the foundation of
1:22:26
universal basic income and universal basic capital and collectively owned assets. Um then you have you have a new
1:22:35
paradigm where people own more and more property. Therefore they are participating in the growing pie more
1:22:41
and more. that and that that is exactly where we need to be moving clearly that that's the message. So now you mentioned
1:22:48
so so let let's just I want to just linger on this for a moment in the personal personal accumulated assets
1:22:54
your property you mentioned things uh am I back
1:23:00
I u you mentioned some obvious things like your rental property if you were
1:23:07
fortunate to invest in you know a condo or a house that you are renting that's an example of personally accumulated
1:23:13
assets or the stocks and bonds and and and and mutual funds that you have invested through your pension. But think
1:23:21
of that actually as your passive income source and look at I I would suggest that
1:23:27
everyone ought to be considering and contemplating what might be other
1:23:32
sources of passive income that you could be acting on. What could be some of
1:23:38
those sources of income? I give you a couple of examples that's that are maybe too obvious but nevertheless a vending
1:23:45
machine business is an example of a passive income business right there is some startup there is some work but for
1:23:51
all intents and purposes that is a a a way to to enter into to expand your
1:23:56
sources of passive income. Pay attention to what's happening out there and opportunities that are
1:24:02
emerging that might not be self-obvious. For example, um a month ago, uh Tesla
1:24:11
allowed full service driving and allowing people to actually convert their vehicles into robot taxis.
1:24:17
This changes fundamentally the whole sector where now you are your your depreciating asset which is a car has
1:24:26
always been a depreciating asset unless you invested in something that is going to acrue value over decades like a
1:24:33
Ferrari. Your cars are depreciating assets. The cars of the future could actually be
1:24:39
a revenue generating assets, right? So, there are opportunities
1:24:47
to pay attention and and get yourself involved that will further strengthen
1:24:52
your passive income source. And the whole trick here I think is to figure out how do we get the whole population
1:24:58
to expand their passive income so that we can all benefit from the automation that is going to be generating the
1:25:05
wealth to fund the society going forward. Right. So to me that is really important to to to to to to
1:25:14
focus on. Right. Absolutely. And then on the very top residual wages.
1:25:22
Yes. Yeah. So as I mentioned earlier, you know, much a huge component of
1:25:27
economic productivity has already decoupled from human inputs and that's going to continue. With that being said,
1:25:34
not all jobs and not all labor is going to go away forever. Uh there's if you
1:25:39
look at what's called Balos's cost disease, you can you can look at where wages and inputs are already going up.
1:25:46
Uh so for instance, things like personal coaches, yoga instructors, healthcare, education. Now healthcare and education
1:25:53
might be completely upended by automation here soon but the the definition of balance cost disease is
1:25:59
that low productivity and low elasticity domains tend to become more expensive as
1:26:06
everything else depreciates because more demand goes to those unique services. So
1:26:11
like a good therapist a good therapist is always in demand and so they're always booked up. That's an example of
1:26:16
of demand rising for those particular kinds of services that'll go up uh for
1:26:22
the foreseeable future and and perhaps even permanently just due to human preferences
1:26:27
uh for things like live performances, what's called the meaning economy or the experience economy or the attention
1:26:33
economy. There's going to be many many segments of the economy that do stick around forever, but how many comedians
1:26:39
do we really need? And and also you have to be a good enough comedian to sell tickets just as an example. So there's
1:26:45
always going to be some of those jobs that stick around forever. Another category of jobs that'll probably stick around are what are called statutory
1:26:52
jobs or high liability jobs. Yeah. So that is something where a human needs to be involved for regulatory compliance or
1:26:59
because they're a judge or a politician, you need a human signature and you need someone who's going to be accountable
1:27:04
for that particular decision or activity. Um, and then a final category that someone pointed out to me recently
1:27:11
is even as AI and robots get better, humans are still relatively energy
1:27:17
efficient. Uh, we run very cool. Our brain only consumes about 20 watts of energy. If you have a lunchbox with a
1:27:23
few pounds of food, you can operate all day out in the field. Y, so there's, you know, but who wants to
1:27:28
be a deep deep woods forester? Not everyone wants to be a deep woods forester. Not everyone can be a deep woods
1:27:33
forester um or an emergency first responder. And who knows, it could be that robots end up better at those jobs
1:27:39
than us anyways. But the point is is that some jobs are going to stick around
1:27:44
probably indefinitely. We might ultimately create entirely new job sectors. It remains to be seen. There's
1:27:50
nothing on the horizon. That's one thing that's important to emphasize. There's nothing on the horizon. But some of
1:27:56
those jobs are going to stick 20 to 30% of household income will be residual
1:28:02
wages. That is that we're looking at an aggregate. We're looking at saying, okay, it's 70 to 80% right now, 60 60 to
1:28:09
80% right now, depending on the nation. That's going to shrink as a as a component of aggregate household income.
1:28:17
So therefore, you need to grow property and to a lesser extent transfers to make
1:28:22
up for that difference. Yeah. And and so David and and through this last commentary, I think you've
1:28:28
touched on this question. By the way, the the Q&A is lighting up and I'm try trying to see if we are addressing
1:28:35
questions from people who are asking many of many people are actually asking about what what are the jobs that will
1:28:41
remain. Um what would be your general advice to people? Um what should they be
1:28:47
thinking and doing right now? Let's say you're talking to, you know, a a a 20
1:28:53
year experienced knowledge worker, pickup profession, accountant, engineer,
1:28:59
professor, like what what would be your perspective and advice to people?
1:29:04
Yeah. So the number one thing is is the most valuable skill is communication. Uh and communication comes in all formats
1:29:11
whether it is negotiation or conflict resolution or coaching or presentation.
1:29:17
um that kind of skill is is very much baseline to everything that's going to
1:29:23
stick around. Whether you're whether you want to pivot to become a personal coach or a yoga instructor or an influencer,
1:29:29
right? Uh every time I give a talk at a university, one of the things that's brought up is that the number one job
1:29:35
for uh for young people is they want to be YouTubers. And well, I'm I make a living from YouTube. And so they how did
1:29:41
you do it? It's communication, right? You get good at running meetings. You get good at talking to strangers. you
1:29:46
get good at at you know expressing yourself and of course you do it all the time like I do and you get
1:29:52
you get better at it. Uh so communication absolutely is the foundational skill uh for the future. Um
1:30:00
that that not just foundational but universal. beyond that when you look at like okay
1:30:06
where what's the direction that things are going um you can look at what your true passions are and look at where the
1:30:13
where the there's an intrinsic component to something that that uh that adds value. So think about things like
1:30:20
authenticity, um, experience, empathy. So this is when we go back to the four
1:30:25
categories of of where humans add value, which is, uh, strength, dexterity, cognition, and empathy. Empathy is the
1:30:32
final attribute that some of that is irreplaceable. Even if machines are good
1:30:38
at faking it, uh, authenticity is underpinned by empathy. So for instance,
1:30:44
I have members of my audience and one of the reasons that I have uh that I have a large enough audience that supports me
1:30:51
is because of that authenticity. A lot of my audience doesn't even agree with me, but there's a there's a level of
1:30:56
connection and authenticity that to them is valuable and it's valuable enough that they choose to support me to to
1:31:02
support me in my work. Yep. Excuse me. Um so yeah, just think about those things. Um what one thing that's
1:31:10
interesting is that the meaning economy and the experience economy none of it is new. These jobs have always existed.
1:31:15
Whether it's priests or entertainers or live musicians or uh people in helping
1:31:20
and care professions, those jobs have always existed. But what happens as
1:31:25
we're moving into this fourth economic paradigm after the agg uh agricultural paradigm, manufacturing and service,
1:31:32
we're moving into this experience economy. And so these jobs that have been relatively small are now getting
1:31:38
bigger. So for instance, I have a I have an upcoming podcast with a about
1:31:43
coaching and there was a glut of people entering the coaching space a couple years ago. So there was a market
1:31:49
correction where there was too many coaches and it kind of cooled off. But it's still a growing sector. It's still a massively growth uh growing sector.
1:31:56
Nurses as well uh and those sorts of things. So there's always going to be some area that's that's growing. Now, is
1:32:04
that going to be enough to absorb everyone that loses their jobs? Probably not. Probably not. That's why hence this conversation. But
1:32:11
for those that are that are eagle-eyed and hardworking and already well positioned and honestly sometimes a
1:32:17
little bit of luck goes into it, um, but for for for the right people and the the with the right motivation, you can pivot
1:32:24
and get into something that's going to be a little bit more durable in the long run. I think really this is really worth
1:32:30
emphasizing the meaning economy and the experience economy and this actually
1:32:35
triggered a thought um you know when I go to the local coffee shop I actually you know or or or in my
1:32:44
case not a hairdresser but a barber let's say I do want the barber to to to to to shave me and we have a
1:32:50
conversation right and it's a local person that I've known for 30 years right and So there is that quality that
1:32:59
I think is going to remain. As a matter of fact, if I think if we play this movie forward, if anything, we are going
1:33:06
to become much more communal in our community as we build relationships with
1:33:11
people with whom we're going to be interacting in our dayto-day which then takes me to a second uh consideration
1:33:18
here. Uh when I think about jobs that are going to be impacted in sequence in
1:33:23
sequence you you described humans bring strength dexterity cognition and empathy
1:33:32
and we've already automated strength. I think that it is actually cognition that
1:33:38
is a different frontal attack right now and that dexterity type jobs are actually safer now
1:33:45
than in than than cognition type jobs. So to me I think and I don't know I
1:33:51
don't know if you agree or not but like if I look at somebody who is you know a mid-career accountant and somebody who
1:33:57
is a plumber I think that the plumber is going to skip their job longer than the accountant going forward.
1:34:05
Yes. Uh I'll say yes, but there is a caveat. Um and and you're absolutely
1:34:10
right because of the because of the combination of problem solving and expertise as well as fine motor control
1:34:17
that goes into electrical work, HVAC, plumbing, those sorts of things. And that's just a few. There's plenty of
1:34:22
jobs like that. Welders, right? Um I remember having lunch with someone who is an underwater welder. That is a tough
1:34:28
job. It'll be a while before a robot can do that. However, as the accountants
1:34:34
start losing their jobs, they're going to retrain. And some of them are going to retrain to be plumbers and HVAC
1:34:40
technicians, which means there's going to be a labor glut in some of those.
1:34:45
Correct. They're still going to get hit with a
1:34:51
spillover effect from some of these other layoffs that are going to start happening because the accountants and developers who lose their jobs, they're
1:34:57
pretty sharp people as well, right? They're they they're probably mentally capable of retraining in in the cases
1:35:04
that they want to. Some of them will choose not to. Not everyone wants to go become a septic worker, right? You know,
1:35:09
but at the same time, some of them will. Uh and that that could spell problems uh
1:35:15
potential problems for people that are already in that space. Yeah. So now here is another thought
1:35:21
that I think is is is we we should touch on the a lot of this disruption comes to
1:35:28
comes to us through what is happening in artificial intelligence or as Uval calls
1:35:34
it alien intelligence and therefore intellectual type of work
1:35:40
is most at risk for um replacement in the next few years. But I think what
1:35:47
people maybe fail to appreciate is that the real amplification of impact can be
1:35:55
expected when this digital version of artificial intelligence becomes a
1:36:00
physical expression of artificial intelligence through robotics.
1:36:07
And I I think that we are at at at the brink of a Cambrian explosion.
1:36:14
Yes. of robotics where fast forward five years from now people are thinking oh
1:36:21
robotics they think robotics uh on the factory floor and maybe a little bit more creative people think about oh you
1:36:27
know I can completely see how humanoid robot will be useful for me at home and maybe at work but they don't consider
1:36:34
the full spectrum of automation and robotics that is upon us from nano
1:36:40
robots that will be you know in going inside your body to kill a a cancer cell
1:36:47
that will be autonomous and intelligent all the way to Gigafactory which itself
1:36:53
is a autonomous robot that happens to be producing other robots that are on
1:37:00
wheels. So we are looking at the Cambrian explosion of of automation
1:37:05
coming coming at us behind this initial phase of digital intelligence that is
1:37:12
already shaking us right. Yes. So this will be quite quite a like we live in the most interesting times ever
1:37:19
I think. Yeah. There there is a there's an old Chinese proverb that says may you live
1:37:25
in interesting times. Um and we we certainly rolled the dice uh well on that one. Uh but yeah, to your point, um
1:37:33
you know, going back just a little bit, the cog the if your job is primarily what I call a KVM job, keyboard, video,
1:37:39
mouse job, um then you're at the highest risk. And in fact, just last week, OpenAI released their computer using
1:37:47
agent commercially. Yeah. For everyone
1:37:58
uh very soon. And those agents are going to be getting much smarter. Now, that's strictly cyerspace to your point. Then
1:38:05
the combination of wheeled robots, you know, basically one way of thinking about it is is the uh is that any
1:38:11
self-driving car is a kind of robot already. You've got drones. Those are kinds of robots that are autonomously
1:38:17
delivering goods. Sometimes they're delivering weapons on front lines, but they can also be used to deliver lunch.
1:38:23
Um, so you've got that. So you've got wheeled, you've got uh boats and planes and they don't have to be humanoid in
1:38:29
shape and yes even even lights out factories that are completely autonomous that is itself another kind of robot or
1:38:36
you know compound many robots kind of stacked together and as so the the
1:38:41
there's a few constraints there. So while it is exciting um there's there's this principle called Hoffatter's law
1:38:47
which is that it always takes longer than you think it'll take even when you take into account Hoffad's law. So,
1:38:53
first we have to we have to make the robots smart enough, right? They're not quite smart enough yet. The dexterity is
1:39:00
there. Um, but economies of scale, getting the actuators and sensors and building the chassis for cheaper,
1:39:07
scaling up the batteries, those sorts of things. So, that's that's well in hand,
1:39:12
but making them smart enough particularly to be fully autonomous because it takes a lot of intelligence
1:39:18
for planning. So most robots, at least in the early days, are going to be connected to the cloud because that's
1:39:24
you you'll they'll they'll be managed by, you know, a super intelligence in the cloud because you can't run a super
1:39:29
intelligence off of a battery this big yet, right? It's the physics just doesn't work out. It'll take about 10 or
1:39:36
20 years, but then your robot will be far smarter than you. Um I kind of had a
1:39:41
tongue-in-cheek joke saying that like you know that we've achieved super intelligence when it's built into your toaster. Um which is coming. People are
1:39:49
already putting AI into toasters. I'm not sure why, but they are. Um, but the point is is that it it will be
1:39:56
downsized. So, you we have to wait for the intelligence to get denser, the compute to get denser, um, the
1:40:01
construction of the robots to scale up, those sorts of things. Now, when we say like some people say, oh, it's going to
1:40:07
take 40 or 60 years. No, it's going to take 10 to 20 years maximum. Maximum. Um, yeah. and and it's it we're already
1:40:14
seeing uh humanoid robots dislocating some factory jobs. Uh Amazon warehouse,
1:40:21
BMW plant, those are the two first ones. Many thou tens of thousands more are going to be shipped to other warehouses
1:40:28
and factories here soon. And that's a great proving ground for them to become more and more dextrous and more and more
1:40:33
autonomous. And this is 2025. So it would be kind of I think it would be
1:40:38
silly to to uh assume that it's not going to improve much over the next couple years. And we're looking at by
1:40:45
2030, you know, the mass production, the intelligence, the autonomy is going to be there. By 2035, the the ramp up of
1:40:52
produ uh uh production of these units. We're looking at a billion humanoid robots by 2040 at the latest. It very
1:40:58
well could happen sooner as we find efficiencies and you know for instance getting away from uh expensive neodymium
1:41:06
magnets for instance um could be a way to make production cheaper and faster. So it will take a little while but if
1:41:13
you're saying that we only have 10 years until like basically all jobs that as we know today are gone that's very very
1:41:19
fast in the grand scheme of things. That's exactly that's very very fast. And I think that the limiting factor
1:41:24
here, the actual scarce resource is electricity.
1:41:31
That's the scarce resource that that that that once that is solved and we
1:41:36
know it's being solved is going to propel this really quickly. But the second thing that I think people do not
1:41:42
appreciate is the the difference between linear and and and and exponential
1:41:48
curves that yes that once and I think we are close to a
1:41:54
reality that these let's call them alien intelligence systems are going to now
1:42:00
start self-improving and once they start self-improving then all bets are off like the exponential
1:42:07
curve of self-improvement I think I think is going to surprise us and then
1:42:12
that's a how do you actually deploy that towards acceleration of robotics and further
1:42:19
automation I think we are we are up for a for a for major set of surprises over the next months and and and years but
1:42:26
yeah maybe David what we should do is let's maybe shift towards
1:42:32
now what what is the what is the good that can come out of all of this yeah
1:42:38
so this is something that a lot of people love exploring this because it feels science fiction um you know
1:42:45
futurism you it's it's very easy to imagine a utopian future where everything is great uh but I've spent
1:42:51
the last couple years focusing on how do you actually get there and what's it what's it actually going to look like um and so I try and I try
1:42:58
and keep it keep these thoughts grounded in you know what is what's human nature actually show uh what is actually within
1:43:05
the reason for building so one of the places that I like to start is when people say well what about meaning what
1:43:11
about purpose how do I how do I know my value if I don't have a job and uh one
1:43:17
of the things that you can look at is just what is from a from a biological perspective what is it that humans
1:43:23
actually need for their well-being um there's a few frameworks that I've studied for this so one is called self-determination theory where mastery
1:43:30
competence and and relatedness are the three primary psychological drivers so
1:43:36
mastery or competence um is uh and sorry I said that wrong is it's competence,
1:43:41
autonomy and relatedness. Sorry. Um so competence or or mastery is people feel
1:43:47
psychologically good when you're good at something. Um one of the things that I love doing and I'm not going to do it
1:43:53
now because I'm not warmed up is I love singing. I don't make any money from it. I mostly only do it in the shower, but I
1:43:59
like being good at it. um you know and and other people like whether it's restoring Mustangs or building cabinets,
1:44:06
a lot of people do stuff and they get really good at something not for money and sometimes not even for social
1:44:12
acclaim but just for its own sake. So mastery or competence is one of the one of the things that people need and you
1:44:18
don't need a job for that by the way. Uh the next is autonomy. So was actually studying this framework actually taught
1:44:24
me the importance of economic agency because economic agency answers the
1:44:30
fundamental psychological need of autonomy which is how much control do you have over your time. That's the
1:44:37
fundamental thing is you know do you do you wake up when someone else tells you to wake up or do you wake up when you
1:44:42
want to wake up? Uh absolutely
1:44:49
everything that I designed in post-labor economics was how do we increase people's autonomy over time because
1:44:56
that's one of the primary ways to know that your social contract is working because if you say next year you're
1:45:01
going to have even more free time than you have this year and in a decade you're going to have all the free time
1:45:06
in the world then you know that that is that you're moving in the right direction. And the last one is relatedness. Really? Go ahead.
1:45:12
I was going to say I I I came across a wonderful meme that I posted on my LinkedIn post that says, "People
1:45:18
remember the goal is not the money. The goal is freedom." Yes. That's really the autonomy you speak
1:45:25
about. Yep. And that's why we call it the the great decoupling is we're decoupling your livelihood from the wage labor
1:45:33
negotiation. Yeah. Uh we still need it right now. Again, most of the economy is based on wage labor negotiation. There's nothing wrong
1:45:39
with that. It's been a great uh uh coordination mechanism, but it's it's a coordination mechanism that is
1:45:45
disintegrating. Um and then the and so then relatedness is the last part of of SDT framework, which is your
1:45:51
relationships. And if you have more free time, you have more time for relationships. To your point earlier, uh
1:45:56
we will I think we will kind of have a back to basics kind of societal shift
1:46:02
where we focus more on community. Um, just an example of how my wife and I are already living that is we're both
1:46:08
self-employed, so we have more autonomy than we did as employees. But one of the things that we do is we take our dogs to
1:46:13
the dog park every morning and we see the same people at the dog park. Our dogs have friends and we have we're friends with the other dog parents. Um,
1:46:20
and that's just one example of of community that is great and not everyone can live that way right now. Um, and so
1:46:26
I just remind myself every time we go out there, I was like, I want everyone else to be able to do what I do is take
1:46:32
your dog to the dog park every morning or take your children to the park every morning. Um, and not be worried about getting them to school on time or
1:46:39
getting them getting yourself to work on time so that you have more time sovereignty.
1:46:44
Another framework that I studied to understand what is it that humans actually need to be happy and healthy is
1:46:51
uh what was called Glasser's choice theory. And I actually learned this when I was uh interviewing a bunch of educators about artificial intelligence.
1:46:58
This was almost three years ago now. So Glasser's choice theory is a framework that is I think it's it contains six
1:47:04
things. I don't remember all the all the pieces off the top of my head. Uh but basically some of the things that that
1:47:11
people want are like social status. Um they want um so social status or
1:47:16
fame. Um, and there's a lot of overlap between it and Maso's hierarchy, which is how I why I often don't remember all
1:47:23
the components of it. Um, but you want fun. Um, so you want fun, you want status, and and a few other things like
1:47:29
that. Um, and again, none of those are actually predicated on having a job. Now, many people get some of those from
1:47:36
their workplace. You have workplace relationships. you if your if your job is demanding and you feel a sense of
1:47:43
accomplishment or satisfaction from it, you know, you see shows about, you know, high-powered lawyers and it's like they
1:47:49
like winning the deal or whatever. Oh yeah, plenty of people plenty of people do get a lot of their satisfaction, but there
1:47:55
is no intrinsic biological need to use a job to get some of those needs met.
1:48:01
There are plenty of other ways of getting those met. So that's where I start is just a first principles view of
1:48:06
what does the human animal need to be healthy? Uh so and then from there you say well you can ask bigger questions.
1:48:12
How how do we participate in the economy in the future? How do we participate in democracy in the future? And in many
1:48:19
cases it's not going to be that much different. You're still going to go to your bank, right? Your your stock broker and your bank will probably manage a lot
1:48:25
of those resources that we talked about. Universal basic income, universal basic capital, uh collectively owned assets.
1:48:32
you might still do that all through your credit union in the future or your your your commercial bank or your stock
1:48:38
broker. So, some of those things won't necessarily change. Uh democracy, you're
1:48:43
probably still going to vote, but if we adopt some of this the uh platforms like they did in Estonia and some of the that
1:48:50
they're looking at in the EU, it might be that you vote directly from your phone. Um it might be that you also uh
1:48:56
are able to express your values more frequently. So you might have like micro votes that come up and if people aren't
1:49:02
working they have a lot more free time to participate in civil society which by
1:49:07
the way that's nothing new. Uh the in during the golden age of Athens if you were if you were a citizen you
1:49:14
went to the panics and you debated every day right you know listen to Socrates and and and uh and and argue with uh
1:49:20
with the the other other land owners. Same for the Romans. Uh the the uh the
1:49:27
the patrician class of the Romans uh they had the same kind of lifestyle where it was very much they were they
1:49:33
were civically engaged. The ideal Roman citizen was a was a soldier citizen who also was politically active. And if
1:49:40
people are not working and by the way we already see that people are far more political active today. Just look at
1:49:45
social media. Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. Conversation. Uh but uh those are those
1:49:53
are just a couple things that I think will will change. But what I have found because I I I'm obviously still working
1:50:00
very hard, but because I don't have a wage labor negotiation, I try and and
1:50:05
tell people sometimes the transition to a post labor lifestyle is easier and
1:50:12
harder than you think. And and I say that it's easier because you realize, oh, this is what I wanted to do all
1:50:18
along. I wanted to spend more time with my wife and my dogs and and focusing on the things that I care about like post
1:50:24
labor economics. I don't make any money from this work yet. Um so I do it because I think that that it's important and it's meaningful.
1:50:30
Yeah. Um it's harder because we have so much programming so so much so much uh
1:50:38
capitalist programming or uh uh um um uh
1:50:43
Protestant work ethic programming where if you feel if you're idol, you feel guilty, right? you're I'm not I'm not
1:50:49
supposed to be doing nothing. I'm not supposed to be resting. I'm I'm supposed to be working hard and and on the grind.
1:50:55
And you know, I was very burned out for a couple years because of that because I got even better at working harder. And I
1:51:01
tell you, that's no way to live. And interestingly, I achieve more now even though I work less. So work work smarter
1:51:08
not harder. Um and I I think that people will will find that they can find things that they care about whether it's music
1:51:14
or politics or economics or whatever. um you know, ecological work, right? You know, go
1:51:21
clean up a river if if you're if you care about the environment. There's so much for people to do other than work.
1:51:27
Um and we live we certainly live in a society that has uh conditioned us all
1:51:33
to judge our value through the type of work that we do. And many people mo a lot of
1:51:40
people self-define uh based on the role that they play in the company that they work for, right?
1:51:46
Yep. So what I believe first of all I am a techno optimist. I believe that we are
1:51:53
heading and that the age of abundance and and this what you describe is
1:51:58
actually upon us and I I believe it's upon us sooner than we think and that
1:52:03
risk that is facing our society is how to move through this transition period into that state while preserving social
1:52:11
cohesion and peace. Yes. Yeah. But once we do, I think once
1:52:17
we do, and once we are at the stage where you no longer need to be in the labor arbitrage to make a living and to
1:52:26
gain status, we are going to be thinking of the last 12,000 years a as the age of
1:52:33
human enslavement and the future as the age of human liberation. Right? You will be actually
1:52:41
liberated to do those things that you want to be a have competence and mastery
1:52:47
because that they are those things are in your center of your eeky right and
1:52:54
you will have autonomy to pursue it and you will have time and quite frankly
1:53:00
facilitation to strengthen relationships. And if listeners are
1:53:06
saying well what am I going to do? What is going to be my purpose? If those three things do not offer you purpose,
1:53:14
then your other alternative will be to put a VR glasses and just live in right
1:53:19
live in the digital world, I guess. Yep. Yeah. Plenty of people will go that direction. Um I think that some people
1:53:26
will get bored. Uh I think I think after a little while of of digital distractions, some people will say, you
1:53:32
know what, I'm I think I'm ready to do something for my own sake. you know, whether it's get in shape or pick up an
1:53:38
instrument or or that sort of thing. And some people do find, you know, uh, video games challenging enough, you know,
1:53:43
there there skill-based. Uh, so there's plenty of people who go that direction as well.
1:53:48
But yeah, to each their own. And and and that I think going back to the idea of autonomy and selfdirection,
1:53:56
however people want to choose to spend their time, that level of liberation and decoupling, I think is is is the goal.
1:54:02
And that narrative, that story is what I think can get everyone on board. So, thank you for the uh the the time to to
1:54:10
get this message out. Yes. So, I' I've been following the questions as we were
1:54:15
discussing to to make sure that we touch as many as we can. There was one interesting question. Uh I know that you
1:54:21
you are of course focusing on developed countries, developed nations. I am obviously well, I don't know how obvious
1:54:26
it is. I'm a very proud Canadian dialing in from Canada. You are in the United States. Um How just maybe a a question
1:54:34
to how does this work to a in in in in sort of the the non western
1:54:41
economies in the rest of the world let's say. Yeah. So this this is something that comes up quite a bit and I've I've
1:54:48
been studying it just to make sure that I'm wellrounded. And one of the maybe counterintuitive things is that I think
1:54:54
I have personally come to believe that automation particularly cognitive automation is going to hit globally
1:55:00
pretty much all at once. And the reason is because it is cheap.
1:55:05
Uh you know how how much you know a top lawyer you'd pay at least $200,000 a
1:55:10
year whereas these AI systems particularly purpose-built ones cost a few cents an hour to run.
1:55:17
You can run that anywhere. Uh and so there's, you know, to to your point a moment ago, labor arbitrage doesn't mean
1:55:23
a thing anymore. It go it it becomes completely invalidated for cognitive labor. Uh so when you have and and this
1:55:31
is what Sam Alman said is intelligence too cheap to meter, right? Hyper cognitive hyperabundance. If we end up
1:55:36
with cognitive hyperabundance anytime soon, it's going to be a global effect very very quickly. Now the one other
1:55:44
component is well what about physical space? Because in some places, some of the poorest places or or or uh least
1:55:52
developed nations around the world, physical labor is still as cheap as 70 cents an hour. So, it'll take a little
1:56:00
while for humanoid robots to be uh amateurized down to that degree.
1:56:05
However, it's when I say a little while, I mean 5 to 10 years before you have a
1:56:10
$5,000 humanoid robot that can do physical labor at the equivalent of 50
1:56:16
cents an hour. So, while yes, it will take like obviously the places that can afford the
1:56:22
AI and the robots will be impacted first, the spillover effect I think is going to be very very quick uh in the
1:56:29
grand scheme of things. Now, it's not going to be symmetric. It's not going to be all at once, but the but it's not
1:56:35
going to I don't I don't see a case for entire continents or nations being fully
1:56:41
left behind. Um just for no other reason that they all have sunlight hitting them, right? So they have opportunity
1:56:48
for solar, so they have an opportunity for energy abundance. They have usable land that can be used for all kinds of
1:56:55
things and other natural resources. So I see I do not see personally now people
1:57:00
are obviously welcome to disagree um until the framework is fully tightened down but I don't see that being a huge
1:57:07
risk. Now that's not to say that there's not going to be unique problems in the developing world. Those I'm not a aware
1:57:13
of yet. So I'm I'm assuming that there will be regional differences, geographic differences and cultural differences. Um
1:57:21
but I have been primarily focusing on the technology and the economics. Uh so that's kind of my my take for the
1:57:27
developing world. Yeah, David, this has been a fantastic conversation. I have learned a lot. Um
1:57:33
thank you very much for your time. I know we approaching the 2hour mark that we planned for. So I want to be respectful of your time. Um might I just
1:57:40
maybe call out some of the things that I think are important to to to remember for for this call. First, we are in the
1:57:46
middle of a decoupling of labor with productivity and that's driving the
1:57:53
that's driving the conversation of what do we do as humanity? How do we deal with this so that we end up in a better
1:57:59
state? Uh because the the other option is could be truly catastrophic. Um what
1:58:04
we bring as humans to two labor uh arbitrage is essentially strength,
1:58:10
dexterity, cognition, intelligence and empathy. Strength has already been automated. We
1:58:16
are now in the process of automation of dexterity and cognition and that is going to be eroding fast. And the last
1:58:23
for probably the vestage that will stay on will is is the empathy. Um
1:58:28
yes. So that that was important framework to to to remember. Another one that you
1:58:33
that you brought was the fact that automation happens any time when automation can do anything better,
1:58:41
faster, cheaper and safer. And we are now in this situation where systems
1:58:47
actually are better, faster, cheaper and safer on very very on many uh jobs that
1:58:54
now could that now or imminently or in the near term could be automated by
1:59:00
doing it better, faster, cheaper, safer. You introduced the concept of rights of
1:59:06
of economic agency and and and and economic agency that includes labor rights, property rights, democratic
1:59:13
rights and the discussion is that labor rights is eroding as we discussed. So therefore other rights need to stand up
1:59:20
to supplement it if we were to preserve the quality of living namely the property rights. we should be
1:59:25
strengthening democratic rights and perhaps introducing a new pillar around the um the the algorithmic rights. Um
1:59:33
you also mentioned um let me see what else did I take? Yeah, regarding the the future, what are the skill sets that
1:59:40
people need to be aware of and sharpening that you said number one is
1:59:45
is communication, number one skill is communication, number two authenticity,
1:59:50
number three empathy, I might add curiosity and resilience
1:59:56
would be superbly helpful in the package. And then what you also introduced is SDT model or a framework
2:00:03
that helps people think about what might they be doing with themselves at the
2:00:09
point when they find themselves in a comfortable non- labor arbitrage situation and you said focus on your
2:00:17
competence and mastery achieve autonomy and relationships like those are the three things that really important.
2:00:24
David, I would like to give you a closing note or closing remarks and then we can end.
2:00:31
So, excellent. Over to you. Yeah. Well, uh, Dalabore, thank you so much for the, uh, time and attention and for
2:00:38
everyone who's tuned in. Um, it really means a lot, uh, to me. And I, I think I'll end on just kind of a more my my
2:00:46
intuition is is a more personal note, just that, you know, this entire
2:00:51
framework I've been working on for the last couple years. And I always it makes
2:00:56
progress whenever people poke holes in it. They say, "Well, what about this?" And sometimes it can be frustrating when
2:01:01
someone says, "Well, how do you do it peacefully?" or "What about the developing world?" But every time someone asks, "What are those what about
2:01:07
questions?" The whole thing gets better and stronger. And uh and so it has been a it has been
2:01:13
a collaborative process between me and peers and colleagues, but also my
2:01:19
audience. So, and I I I try and read every comment and even if it's a comment that I don't see, I actually hoover up
2:01:25
all the comments that people talk about post labor economics with the help of AI. So, I get a lot of feedback from across
2:01:31
the entire world about uh this framework. So, if you're excited about it, if you have questions, if you have
2:01:37
push back, if you have feedback, uh you know, post it anywhere, post it on LinkedIn, post it on any social media.
2:01:43
I'll eventually see it and that'll it'll that's one of the easiest ways that anyone can contribute and anyone can
2:01:48
help. Now what I will caution there is a there is an asterisk which is that some of the questions some of the common
2:01:54
questions are already addressed in the framework uh but you'll have to wait for the book to come out the great decoupling which the drafting should be
2:02:01
done in a month or two uh and then it's just a matter of the publishing cycle and you'll be able to get your hands on
2:02:06
it. Uh and that's that's all I got. Thank you so much. Thank you. And my invitation to
2:02:11
everybody is to join the movement um to to find David's work um Substack.
2:02:18
Of course, David is also very active on YouTube and has a massive and increasing following and as you would have seen, no
2:02:25
surprise why uh but and also you started on LinkedIn. So there are multiple ways to to get engaged to follow your work
2:02:32
and to contribute to your work and uh like the little part that that I'm doing. So with that, David, thank you
2:02:38
all very much. This has been recorded indeed and very soon we'll be posting it both on the tectonic conversations but
2:02:45
also David will post it on his channel as well. So with that, thank you very much and have yourself a wonderful
2:02:52
Wednesday
