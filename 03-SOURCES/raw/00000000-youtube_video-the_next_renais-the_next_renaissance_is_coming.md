# The Humanities at a Crossroads: Why a Renaissance May Be Coming

## The Crisis in the Academy

Are the humanities on the cusp of a renaissance? This may seem impossible or even ludicrous to entertain right now given the state of the humanities. Both within and outside the academy, the study of literature, art, culture, and philosophy faces embattlement on all sides. Yet there are compelling reasons to believe the humanities might experience a revival in the very near future—and to understand why requires examining how they arrived at this precarious position.

The decline of the humanities in American universities cannot be attributed to a single cause. Both the political right and left have contributed substantially to weakening the academic study of humanities over the past four decades. From the right, conservatives and neoliberals have pushed universities toward a business model, treating education as job training rather than intellectual formation. Beginning in the 1970s, tuition at American universities began rising significantly, and the acceleration was dramatic. While college costs had remained relatively modest since the 1950s, tracking inflation fairly closely, the rates of increase after the late 1970s changed fundamentally. This marks the beginning of what historians call the tuition spiral that has persisted ever since.

The primary cause was a decline in federal and state funding for higher education. After the 1960s—when public universities were heavily subsidized to ensure affordability—states began systematically reducing appropriations per student. Universities compensated by raising tuition. This pattern intensified under the Reagan administration. As governor of California, Reagan pioneered a model of cutting public funding to higher education. He transformed the University of California system from one where tuition was nearly free into something fundamentally different. Reagan's criticism of the university system centered on it being too free, on it harboring what he saw as leftist activism. His policies initiated the long-term transformation of public universities from public goods to consumer commodities.

Reagan's administration embraced free-market ideology and anti-government intervention, reducing federal spending across education and beyond. The underlying philosophy held that individuals, not states, should bear the cost of their own education since they personally benefited from it. In this context, disciplines without clear economic utility—like the humanities—were deemed wasteful at best and delusional at worst. The fiction propagated was that humanistic study produced no practical value.

Meanwhile, from the left, many humanities disciplines underwent their own transformation, and not in a direction that strengthened them. Beginning around the late 1970s—notably, the same period the right was restructuring universities economically—humanities scholarship shifted from studying the true, the beautiful, and the good toward analyzing structures of power and promoting political activism as scholarship. In literary studies especially, Continental theory arrived as a major influence. French theorists—Foucault, Derrida, Marxist cultural theory—offered genuinely excellent tools for thinking about literature. Theory itself was not the problem. The problem was theory becoming the exclusive orthodoxy, pushing out all other perspectives and modes of inquiry.

Post-structuralism and critical theory did yield helpful insights, but their dominance within academia reduced literature and art to political symptoms. Dissertations and books on literature began focusing not on the works themselves but on the colonial, patriarchal, and capitalist structures they supposedly embodied. The academy lost interest in the aesthetic, the formal, the spiritual, and the moral dimensions of literature. Criticism transformed from an appreciation and evaluation of art into a political diagnosis. The ideological left became the new orthodoxy in literary studies, determining admission into graduate programs and success on the job market.

The result is that as the right restructured the university into a market-driven, tuition-funded, managerial institution, the left in the humanities retreated into jargon and discourse on identity and politics. This retreat risked losing connection to the broader structural fight for public education and the common good. Both sides fought each other while the humanities suffered.

What's particularly striking is that both the right and the left eroded the spiritual essence of the humanities—their role in spiritual nourishment, human flourishing, and the cultivation of meaning. These goods are difficult to commodify, and they are also hard to weaponize for the political reform the left sought. As a result, both political extremes lost interest in what the humanities actually exist to do: form human beings, not merely produce wage-earners or activists; cultivate imagination, empathy, wisdom, and moral discernment; and help people find meaning and beauty in life.

If close reading—the careful, attentive engagement with a text—can teach someone to find meaning in poetry and beauty in art, then the same faculties that develop through this practice also help us find meaning and beauty in our own lives. This is the core value of humanistic education. Yet this dimension has been eroded from both sides, and the humanities are no longer celebrated as a shared moral and imaginative education for public and spiritual life.

## The Crisis in the Public

While institutional collapse accelerated, something else was happening in the broader public sphere. Literacy itself is in decline. Depending on how you measure it, proportionally fewer people read. There is growing disdain for the humanities, particularly from an anti-intellectual segment of the political right. Many young people struggle to complete books at all. The causes are often attributed to smartphones and addiction to short-form content, but the issue runs deeper.

The smartphone represents a tool of unprecedented potential—access to humanity's greatest literature and philosophy—yet it functions primarily as a tool for passive entertainment. More troubling, research shows that the negative effects of smartphone addiction fall disproportionately on the poorest among us, those in lower-income households where quiet spaces are scarce and where anxiety and depression are more common. When escape is needed, and resources are limited, smartphones offer instant refuge rather than the slower, deeper engagement that books demand. Research from the Pew Research Center supports this correlation: the decline in reading is particularly acute among economically vulnerable populations who might benefit most from humanistic education.

## Signs of Renewal

Yet within intellectual circles—among cultural historians, literary scholars, philosophers, and even esotericists—there is a building sense that cultural exhaustion often precedes cultural renewal. Historical observation suggests that moments of collapse frequently become preludes to renaissance.

This idea is not fringe. Scholars like Jared Henderson, writing on Substack and in recent interviews, have argued that renaissances and enlightenments follow periods of darkness and cultural despair. From entirely different traditions, others point out that many cultural revivals coincide with specific astronomical cycles. The specifics of these theories matter less than the underlying observation: historical study suggests that cultural renewal does not emerge randomly but often follows periods of profound disorientation.

The important point is not to endorse any particular framework but to recognize that multiple scholars and thinkers across different disciplines are converging on the observation that a genuine renaissance in the humanities may be imminent. If it does arrive, it will happen faster than any previous renewal.

## Why the Next Renaissance Will Begin Outside the Academy

Historically, nearly every major renaissance has emerged either under conditions of institutional collapse or shortly after cultural exhaustion and profound loss of meaning. We are approaching such a moment. Unlike revivals that reform institutions from within, the European Renaissance of the fifteenth century offers a crucial parallel: it began outside the formal academy.

I am currently reading the letters of Marsilio Ficino, an Italian Renaissance translator who introduced Platonic philosophy and Neoplatonic writings to the Latin West during the fifteenth century. At a time when universities were corrupted and trapped in tedious scholastic debates, Ficino created what was essentially an informal study group at his villa near Florence—the Florentine Academy. This was not a formal institution with structured curricula but a genuinely glorified circle of intellectual friends. Yet this paracademic model helped initiate the revival of learning that defined the Renaissance.

What is striking is that the state of medieval universities at that time bears uncanny resemblance to the academy today. Medieval universities across Europe—Paris, Padua, Oxford—were dominated by Aristotelian scholasticism focused on commentary traditions and the reconciliation of Aristotelian philosophy with Christian theology, primarily through Thomas Aquinas. This produced a staleness, an intellectual exhaustion, much like what we see now. The humanities have fragmented into specialized subfields that bicker in jargon. The older ideal of conversation about meaning, beauty, morality, and freedom has been replaced by political infighting and performative scholarship that exhausts both public interest and many scholars themselves.

Yet during this same period of medieval academic decay, other figures worked outside formal institutions. Petrarch, the wandering poet-scholar, revived ancient wisdom not through academic commentary but through more personal, direct encounter with texts. Giovanni Pico della Mirandola rejected narrow academic specialization and created the 900 Theses—a synthesis that attempted to harmonize many fields of knowledge: hermeticism, Kabbalah, astrology, Plato, Aristotle, Christianity. This ambitious syncretism happened outside the university system.

When you examine the characteristics of past cultural renaissances, you find that many followed hard upon institutional collapse and cultural exhaustion. People began finding meaning outside the academy. The Islamic Golden Age in the eighth century followed the collapse of the Umayyad dynasty. The Paleologan Renaissance of the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries emerged from the Eastern Roman Empire's efforts to preserve and transmit Greek learning at a time of political decline. The European Renaissance itself was partly initiated by the fall of Constantinople in 1453. When Byzantine refugees fled westward, they brought with them ancient Greek texts that Byzantine scholars had preserved. These new texts helped loosen the academic stranglehold on universities and knowledge.

The Romantic movement of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was largely sparked by cultural disruption from the Industrial and French revolutions. It contained all the major signs of a cultural, creative, and intellectual revival.

In each of these cases, renewal of the humanities did not arrive from academic institutions. The academy was often a hindrance to these movements until it was eventually reformed. The revival came from exiles, readers, translators, and paracademic educators. Small circles of study reimagined what the humanities could do for society. This is precisely what appears to be emerging now.

## The Coming Shift

The very signs we interpret as symptoms of collapse—technological disruption, institutional distrust, cultural anxiety—may actually be early signs of renaissance. This is already beginning to happen.

Our culture is becoming exhausted by artificially generated content. After a generation of students who use ChatGPT to write essays, once they enter the job market, once society is saturated with people who cannot genuinely speak, write, or dialogue, the effects of intellectual passivity and mindless entertainment will become undeniable. Within the next decade, when these consequences fully manifest, the world will look again to the humanities. If it is able to look anywhere for meaning and substance, it will look there.

Universities that have navigated this nadir will be those that actively fought against gatekeeping and participated in the revival. Some departments are already responding wisely. Harvard's Arts and Humanities Division recently launched the Public Culture Project, aimed at addressing cultural disintegration through public conferences and podcasts that center the humanities' relevance to our current crisis. Rutgers's Public Humanities Initiative, the Public Humanities programs at Yale and NYU, and Steinhardt's Project for the Advancement of Common Humanity represent similar efforts to bridge academic study and public need.

In coming years, I believe many people will stop seeing the humanities as weapons for political ideology or as suspect to the anti-intellectual right. Instead, they will recognize them for what they actually are: a tool for building a more just and democratic society, and an instrument of human happiness and flourishing.

Until then, what comes next will be refining fire.
