I worked at Tesla starting from 2017 thru 2021. I spent most of my time in the distribution and supply chain organizations in leadership positions.

Before Tesla, I was a Director of Business Intelligence and Pricing at the largest Pet Food & Supply distributor in the US, Phillips Pet Food & Supplies. My wife and I also owned a small business in Bethlehem, PA between 2016 and 2019.

I have been a shareholder of Tesla since 2012 and currently own Tesla stock. Nothing I say constitutes as investment or financial advice.

My thoughts are my own and are not representative of everyone who currently works, or has worked at Tesla, Phillips, or any other company or organization I discuss on this channel.

Thank you. We're at a critical
0:01
inflection point for Tesla and our
0:03
strategy going forward as we bring AI
0:05
into the real world. I think it's
0:06
important to emphasize that Tesla really
0:09
is the leader in real world AI. No one
0:12
can do what we can do with real world
0:14
AI. I have pretty good insight into AI
0:17
in general. I think that Tesla has the
0:19
highest intelligence density of any AI
0:22
out there in the car and that is only
0:24
going to get better. And we're really
0:25
just at the beginning of scaling at a
0:27
quite massively full self-driving and
0:30
robo taxi and fundamentally changing the
0:32
nature of transport. I think people just
0:34
don't quite appreciate the degree to
0:36
which this will take off. It's honestly
0:39
it's going to be like a shock wave. It's
0:41
you cuz the cars are all out there.
0:42
There are millions of cars out there
0:45
that with a software update become full
0:49
self-driving cars and we're making a
0:52
couple million a year. In fact, with
0:54
what we see now as a clarity on
0:56
achieving full self-driving,
0:57
unsupervised full self-driving, I feel
0:59
confident in expanding Tesla's
1:02
production. So, that is our intent to
1:05
expand as quickly as we can our future
1:08
production.
1:10
I was ret to do that until we had
1:12
clarity on uh achieving unsupervised
1:15
full self-driving. But at this point, I
1:18
feel like we've got clarity and it makes
1:20
sense to expand production as fast as we
1:23
reasonably can. We're also making huge
1:26
impact on the energy sector with battery
1:28
storage. So with both the power wall and
1:32
especially with the mega pack we are
1:34
dramatically improving the ability to
1:38
generate more energy from the grid. If
1:40
you look at total US energy capability
1:43
for example there's roughly a terowatt
1:45
of continuous power available in the US
1:48
but the average usage over 24hour cycle
1:51
is only half a terowatt because of the
1:54
big difference between day and night
1:56
usage. If you buffer the energy with
1:58
batteries, you can effectively double
2:00
the energy output of the United States
2:02
just with batteries building no
2:03
incremental power plants. And it's very
2:05
difficult to build power plants. They
2:07
take a long time. There's a lot of
2:08
permitting and it's not an industry
2:10
that's used to moving fast. So we see
2:14
the potential there for Tesla battery
2:17
packs to greatly improve the energy
2:21
output per year for any given grid, US
2:23
or otherwise. We're also on the cusp of
2:25
something really tremendous with
2:26
Optimus, which I think has potential to
2:29
be the biggest product of all time. It's
2:32
a a difficult project. Um, and it's
2:34
worth noting that it's not just
2:36
automatic. I'm unaware of any robot
2:38
program by Ford or GM or US sort of car
2:42
companies. People think of Tesla as a
2:44
car company. We mostly make cars and
2:46
battery packs. It's not an obvious hall
2:49
of a lugg thing to make Optimus, but we
2:51
do have the ingredients of real world
2:53
AI, exceptional electrical, mechanical
2:56
engineering capabilities, and the
2:58
ability to scale production,
3:01
which I don't think anyone else has all
3:03
of those ingredients. With version 14 of
3:06
self-driving, which people, you can see
3:07
the reactions of people online, they're
3:10
quite amazed. Anyone in the US can get
3:13
version 14 if they just go and select I
3:16
want the advanced software in their car.
3:19
If you'd like to try it out, just go in
3:21
settings and say I want the advanced
3:23
software and you'll get version 14. So
3:26
on the Mega Pac front, we unveiled Mega
3:29
3. We also have exciting plans for Mega
3:31
Pac 4. Mega Pac 4 will incorporate a lot
3:35
of what is normally in a substation and
3:37
be able to output at probably 35
3:41
kilovolts directly. This greatly
3:44
improves our ability to deploy Mega
3:46
because it's not dependent on building a
3:49
substation up through 35 KV for Mega Pac
3:52
4. That's the engineering priority for
3:55
Mega Pac. We look forward to unveiling
3:58
Optimus B3 probably in Q1. I think it'll
4:02
be ready to show off and I think it's
4:05
going to be quite remarkable. If you It
4:07
won't even seem like a robot. It'll seem
4:09
like a person in a robot suit, which is
4:12
kind of how we started off with Optimus.
4:13
But it it'll seem so real that you'll
4:16
need to like I think to believe that
4:18
it's actually a robot. And obviously
4:19
like the real world intelligence we're
4:21
devel we've developed for the car, most
4:24
of that transfers to Optimus. So it's a
4:27
very good starting point. In conclusion,
4:29
we're excited about the updated mission
4:31
of Tesla, which is sustainable
4:32
abundance.
4:34
So, going beyond sustainable energy to
4:36
say sustainable abundance is the mission
4:40
where uh we believe with Optimus and
4:44
self-driving
4:45
you can actually create a world where
4:47
there is no poverty, where everyone has
4:52
access to the finest medical care.
4:55
Optimus will be an incredible surgeon,
4:57
for example, and imagine if everyone had
5:00
access to an incredible surgeon. I think
5:02
there's, of course, we make sure Optimus
5:04
is safe and everything, but I do think
5:07
we're headed for a world of sustainable
5:09
abundance and that I'm excited to work
5:11
with the Tesla team to make that happen.
5:13
We are expecting to
5:16
have no safety drivers in at least large
5:20
parts of Austin by the end of this year.
5:21
So within a few months, we expect to
5:23
have no safety drivers at all. We're
5:25
obviously being very cautious about the
5:28
deployment. Our goal is to be actually
5:30
paranoid about deployment because even
5:31
one accident will be front page headline
5:34
news worldwide. It's better for us to
5:36
take a cautious approach here, but we do
5:38
expect to have no safety drivers in the
5:40
car within a few months. I think that's
5:43
perhaps the most important data point.
5:45
And then we we do expect to be operating
5:48
robo taxi in I think about 8 to 10 metro
5:53
areas by the end of the year. Depends on
5:56
various regulatory approvals. Most of
5:58
our regulatory applications are online.
6:00
You can kind of see them because they're
6:01
public information, but we expect to be
6:03
operating in Nevada, Florida, and
6:05
Arizona by the end of the year. Yeah,
6:08
bringing off Optimus to market is is an
6:10
incredibly difficult task to be clear.
6:12
Not like some walk in the park. We do
6:14
have Optimus robots that walk around our
6:17
offices at our engineering headquarters
6:18
in Palo Alto, California basically 24
6:21
hours a day, seven days a week. So any
6:23
visitors that come by, you actually you
6:25
guys stop one of the Optimus robots and
6:27
ask it to take you somewhere and it'll
6:28
literally take you to that meeting room
6:30
or that location in the building. I
6:32
don't want to downplay the difficulty of
6:34
Optimus. It's an incredibly difficult
6:35
thing. Especially, it's difficult to
6:38
create a hand that is as dextrous and
6:40
capable as the human hand, which is an
6:42
incredible, the human hand is an
6:44
incredible thing. The more you study the
6:45
human hand, the more incredible you
6:47
realize the human hand is. And and why
6:49
you need five, you know, four fingers
6:51
and a thumb, why the fingers have
6:53
certain degrees of freedom, you know,
6:54
why the various muscles are of different
6:57
strengths, the fingers are of different
6:58
lengths. It turns out actually that
7:00
those are all there for a reason. and
7:02
making it that the hand and forearm
7:04
because most of the actuator just like
7:06
the human hand the muscles that control
7:08
your hand are actually primarily in your
7:09
forearm. The Optimus hand and forearm is
7:12
an incredibly difficult engineering
7:14
challenge more difficult than the rest
7:16
of from an electromechanical standpoint
7:18
the forearm and hand are more difficult
7:20
than the entire rest of the robot. But
7:22
really, in order to have a useful
7:24
generalized robot, you you need this.
7:27
You do need an incredible hand. And you
7:29
need the real world AI, you need to be
7:31
able to scale up that production to have
7:34
it be relevant because it's not relevant
7:36
if it's just a few hundred robots. So,
7:38
you need to be able to make Optimus
7:40
robots at volumes comparable to
7:42
vehicles, if not significantly higher.
7:45
So you're trying to make a million or
7:47
something per year, trying to make a
7:49
million Optimus robots per year, that
7:51
manufacturing challenge is immense
7:53
considering that the supply chain
7:55
doesn't exist. With cars, you've got an
7:57
existing supply chain. With computers,
7:59
you've got an existing supply chain.
8:01
With with a humanoid robot, there is no
8:03
supply chain. In order to manufacture
8:06
that, Tesla actually has to be very
8:08
vertically integrated and manufacture
8:11
very deep into the supply chain.
8:13
manufacture the parts internally because
8:15
there just is no supply chain. If I put
8:18
myself in the position of a startup
8:19
trying to make a humanoid robot, I don't
8:21
know how to do it without an immense
8:23
amount of manufacturing technology.
8:26
That's why I think Tesla's in a unique
8:28
position when you consider manufacturing
8:30
technology scaling, real world AI, and
8:34
and a truly dextrous hand. Those are the
8:36
things that are missing when you read
8:38
about other robots that just don't have
8:41
those three things. So now I think we
8:43
can achieve all those things, those
8:46
three things with an immense amount of
8:47
work. And that is the game plan. So you
8:50
know, my fundamental concern with regard
8:52
to how much voting control I have in
8:54
Tesla is if I go ahead and build this
8:57
enormous robot army, can I just be
8:59
ousted at some point in the future?
9:01
That's my biggest concern. That is
9:02
really the only thing I'm trying to
9:03
address with this. So what's called
9:05
compensation, but it's not like I'm
9:07
going to go spend the money. It's just
9:09
if we build this robot army on me, do I
9:11
have at least a strong influence over
9:13
that robot? Not control, but a strong
9:15
influence. So that's what it comes down
9:17
to in a nutshell. I don't feel
9:19
comfortable building that robot army if
9:20
I don't have at least a strong
9:21
influence. First of all, I have nothing
9:23
but great things to say about Samsung.
9:25
They're an amazing company and Samsung,
9:27
is worth noting, does manufacture our
9:30
AI4 computer and does a great job doing
9:33
that. Now, with the AI5, I I need to
9:36
make a point of clarification relative
9:38
to some comments I've made publicly
9:40
before, which is we're actually going to
9:42
focus both TSMC and Samsung initially on
9:47
AI5.
9:48
The AI5 chip design by Tesla is I think
9:52
it's an amazing design.
9:54
I have spent almost every weekend for
9:56
the last few months with the chip design
9:58
team working on AI5 and I don't hand out
10:02
praise easily but I have to say that I
10:04
think the Tesla chip team is really
10:08
designing an incredible chip here. By
10:10
some metrics the AI5 chip will be 40
10:14
times better than the AI4 chip. Not 40%
10:19
40 times. We have a detailed
10:22
understanding of the entire software and
10:24
hardware stack. So, we're designing the
10:26
hardware to address all of the pain
10:28
points in software. So, I don't think
10:31
there there really isn't anyone that's
10:32
doing the entire stack calibrating
10:35
against the real world where you've got
10:36
cars and robots. We know what the chip
10:38
needs to do and just as importantly, we
10:39
know what the chip doesn't need to do.
10:42
Sort of give you some examples here with
10:45
the AI5. We deleted the legacy GPU or
10:49
the traditional GPU which is in AI4. But
10:52
AI5 does not have the legacy GPU because
10:56
it basically is a GPU. We also deleted
10:58
the image signal processor. There's a
11:00
long list of deletions that are very
11:02
important. As a result of these
11:04
deletions, we can AI5 in a half reticle
11:09
with good margin for the traces from the
11:12
memory to the Tesla trip accelerators.
11:16
the ARM the ARM CPU cores and and the
11:19
PCI X sort of the PCI blocks. So this is
11:23
a beautiful chip. I've poured so much
11:26
life energy into this chip personally
11:28
and I'm confident this will be a winner
11:30
next level. It makes sense to have both
11:35
Samsung TSMC books on AI5. Even the
11:40
Samsung FAP has slightly more advanced
11:43
equipment than the TSMC FAB. These will
11:45
both be made in the US that in one TSMC
11:48
in Arizona Samsung in Texas and we're
11:52
going to make starting off just to be
11:54
confident of having explicit goal is to
11:57
have an over supply of AI5 chips because
12:01
if we have too many AI5 chips for the
12:03
cars and robots we can always put them
12:04
in the data center. So we already use AI
12:07
full for training data center. So we use
12:09
a combination of AI full and Nvidia
12:12
hardware. We're not about to replace
12:14
Nvidia to be clear, but we do use both
12:16
in combination AI4 and Nvidia hardware
12:19
and the five excess production. We can
12:22
always put in our data centers. Nvidia
12:25
keeps improving. The challenge that they
12:27
have is that they've got to satisfy a
12:28
lot of requirements from a lot of
12:30
customers, but Tesla only has to satisfy
12:32
requirements from one customer with
12:34
Tesla. That makes the design job
12:36
radically easier and means we can delete
12:39
a lot of complexity from the chip. like
12:41
I can't emphasize how important this is.
12:43
When you look at the various logic
12:45
blocks in the chip, as you increase the
12:46
number of logic blocks, you also
12:48
increase the interconnections between
12:50
the logic blocks. So you can think of
12:52
like how many highways do you need to
12:53
connect the various parts of the chip.
12:56
It's a very it becomes an almost
12:57
impossibly difficult design problem and
12:59
Nvidia has done an amazing job of
13:00
dealing with almost an impossibly
13:02
difficult set of requirements. In our
13:04
case, we we're going for radical
13:06
simplicity. The net effect is that I
13:09
think AI5 will be the best performance
13:13
per watt maybe by a factor of two or
13:15
three and the best performance per
13:18
dollar for AI maybe by a factor of 10.
13:21
So you know that's we'll have to the
13:24
proof's in the pudding. So obviously we
13:25
need to actually get this ship made and
13:27
made it scale but that's what it looks
13:30
like. Well our capacity isn't quite 3
13:32
million but it it will be 3 million at
13:35
some point aspirationally. It could be
13:37
three million within we could probably
13:38
hit an annualized rate of three million
13:40
within 24 months I think maybe less than
13:42
24 months bearing in mind that there's
13:44
an entire supply chain that's got to
13:46
also move in tandem with that. So we're
13:49
going to expand production as fast as we
13:52
can and as fast as our suppliers can
13:53
keep up with it and then we're going to
13:55
think about where do we build
13:56
incremental factories beyond that. The
13:59
single biggest expansion in production
14:01
will be the cyber cap which starts
14:03
production in Q2 next year. That's
14:05
really a vehicle that's optimized for
14:07
full autonomy. It in fact does not have
14:09
a steering wheel or pedals and is really
14:12
an engineering optimization on
14:13
minimizing cost per mile of operation.
14:16
So that's, you know, we for the other
14:18
for the for our other vehicles, they're
14:20
still they still have a little bit of
14:22
the horseless carriage thing going on
14:23
where, you know, obviously you've got if
14:24
you're still if you've got steering
14:25
wheels and pedals and and and you're
14:27
designing a car that people might want
14:29
to go, you know, very do right past
14:32
acceleration and tight cornering like
14:33
high performance car, then you're going
14:35
to design a different car than one that
14:37
is optimized for a comfortable ride. It
14:39
doesn't expect to go past sort of 85 or
14:42
90 miles an hour and it's it's just
14:44
aiming for a gentle ride the whole time.
14:46
That's what cyber cap is. So yeah. So so
14:49
it's
14:51
do I think we'll sacrifice margins? I
14:52
don't think so. I think the demand will
14:54
be pretty nutty. Like here's the here's
14:56
the killer app. Really what it comes
14:58
down to is can you text can you text
14:59
while you're in the car? And if you tell
15:01
someone, yes, that the car is now so
15:03
good, you can you can you can be on your
15:06
phone and text the entire time while
15:09
you're in the car, it's anyone who can
15:12
buy the car will buy the car and and a
15:15
story. So that's what everybody wants to
15:17
do. In fact, not everyone wants to do
15:19
it. They do do that. And that's why in
15:20
fact, the reason you've seen like that
15:22
there's been an uptick in accidents
15:25
pretty much worldwide is because people
15:27
are texting and driving. So autopilot
15:30
actually dramatically improves the
15:31
safety here because if somebody's
15:33
looking down at their phone, they're not
15:34
driving very well. So that's that's
15:36
really the the game changer. And you
15:39
know, we we do see like at this point I
15:43
feel you know, essentially 100%
15:45
confident I say not essentially 100%
15:48
confident that we can set that we can
15:50
solve unsupervised full self-driving at
15:53
a safety level much greater than human.
15:57
So, we've released 14.1. We've got a
16:00
technology roadmap that's I think pretty
16:03
amazing. We'll be adding reasoning to
16:06
the car. Our world simulator for
16:09
reinforcement learning is pretty
16:10
incredible. When you see the Tesla
16:12
reality simulator, you can't tell the
16:14
difference between the video that's
16:16
generated by the Tesla reality simulator
16:18
and the actual video. Looks exactly the
16:20
same. So that allows us to have a very
16:24
powerful reinforcement learning loop to
16:26
further improve the Tesla AI. We're
16:28
going to be increasing the parameter
16:30
count by an order of magnitude that's
16:32
not in 14.1. There are also a number of
16:35
other improvements to the AI that are
16:37
quite radical. So it's this car will
16:40
feel like it is a living creature.
16:42
That's how good the AI will get with the
16:44
AI full computer. This is before AI5.
16:47
And then AI5 like I said is by some
16:49
metrics 40 times better. Let's just say
16:51
safely it's a 10x improvement. So it
16:55
might almost be too much intelligence
16:56
for a car. I do wonder like how much
16:58
intelligence should you have in a car?
16:59
It might get bored. And then one of the
17:02
things I thought like well if we got all
17:04
these cars that maybe are bored well
17:06
while they're sort of if they are bored
17:08
we could actually have a giant
17:10
distributed inference fleet and say like
17:13
well if they're not actively driving
17:15
let's just have a giant distributed
17:16
inference fleet. At some point if you've
17:18
got like tens of millions of cars in the
17:20
fleet or maybe at some point 100 million
17:21
cars in the fleet and let's say they had
17:24
at that point a kilowatt of inference
17:27
capability of high performance inference
17:30
capability that's 100 gaw of inference
17:32
distributed
17:34
with with power and cooling taken care
17:35
of. So that seems like a pretty
17:37
significant asset. Actually, I'm not
17:39
sure what you mean by AI applications
17:41
outside of Tesla's core competency, but
17:43
we didn't have any of these core
17:45
competencies when we started, you know.
17:47
So, it's like we had zero core
17:49
competencies, total competency of zero.
17:51
Actually, you can think of Tesla as like
17:53
a dozen startups in one company. I've
17:55
initiated every one of those startups.
17:57
So, it's used to make battery packs, so
18:01
stationary battery packs, but now we do.
18:03
We make them for the home, make them for
18:04
utility scale with our wall mega pack.
18:08
created the supercharge network
18:11
globally. No one else has created a
18:13
global supercharger network. In fact,
18:14
that North American supercharge network
18:16
is so good at that that basically the
18:19
every other manufacturer in North
18:20
America has converted to our standard
18:23
and uses our the Tesla supercharger
18:25
network and the chip design team started
18:28
that from scratch. The Tesla AI software
18:31
team was started from scratch. I
18:33
literally just say, "Hey, we're going to
18:34
start this thing." I post it on Twitter
18:36
now X and then you know join us if you'd
18:40
like to build it. In fact, Shook was I
18:43
believe the first person I interviewed
18:44
for the Tesla autopilot team which we
18:46
now call Tesla AI software team which
18:49
because it is the AI software team.
18:51
Optimus at scale it is the infinite
18:54
money glitch. It's like this is a it's
18:57
difficult to express the magnitude of
19:00
like if you've got something that like
19:03
that like if optimist I think probably
19:05
achieve 5x the productivity of a person
19:07
per year because it can operate 24/7 it
19:11
can operate a tethered so it's plugged
19:12
in the whole time that's why I call it a
19:14
future of sustainable abundance where
19:16
working will be optional you know there
19:19
there's there's limit to how much how
19:20
much AI can do in terms of enhancing the
19:22
productivity of humans but there is not
19:25
really a limit to AI that is embodied.
19:28
That's why I called the infinite money
19:29
glitch. But we also have actually added
19:31
a lot of new engineers as well to the
19:33
team. So there's actually a lot of the
19:35
credit for the Optimus engineering is
19:39
actually also new engineers. Many of
19:40
them that are just out of college
19:41
actually.
19:42
Yeah.
19:42
So the Optimus engineering team is a
19:46
very talented engineering team at this
19:48
point. So there's the engineering review
19:51
and then there's the manufacturing
19:52
review made done simultaneously with an
19:55
iterative loop between engineering
19:57
design and manufacturing because then we
19:59
see we we design something and we say
20:01
like oh man that's really difficult to
20:02
make. We need to change that design to
20:04
make it easier to manufacture. So we
20:06
made radical improvements to the design
20:08
of Optimus while increasing the
20:11
functionality but making it actually
20:12
possible to manufacture. Like I'd say
20:14
Optimus 2 is almost impossible to
20:16
manufacture frankly.
20:18
to buy's point, we've gone from, you
20:21
know, a person in a robot outfit to what
20:24
what people have seen with Optimus 2.5
20:26
where it's doing kung fu, you know, was
20:28
like Optimus was at the at the Tron
20:31
premiere doing kung fu, you know, just
20:34
out in the open, you know, like with
20:36
Jared Leto. Like there wasn't nobody was
20:38
controlling it. It was just doing kung
20:40
fu with Jared Leto, you know, at the
20:43
Tron Fair. You can see the videos
20:45
online. And actually the funny thing is
20:47
like a lot of people walked past it
20:49
thinking it was just a person even
20:52
though with Optimus 245 you can see that
20:55
it has a waist that's 3 in wide which
20:57
result not a human but the movements
21:00
were so humanlike that people didn't
21:01
realize a lot of people didn't realize
21:02
they were looking at a robot and what
21:04
I'm saying is like Optimus 3 will be a
21:07
giant improvement on that and made it
21:10
scale like I said a very difficult thing
21:14
the the Optimus sort injuring and
21:16
manufacturing reviews and there's the
21:18
Friday night meeting with Optimus which
21:21
sometimes goes till midnight and then my
21:24
Saturday meeting is with the AI chip
21:26
design team. Those two things are
21:29
crucial to the future of the company.
21:31
There are different forms of AI. The XAI
21:33
so Grock is like a giant model that you
21:37
could not possibly squeeze onto a car.
21:39
That's for sure. It is a giant beast of
21:40
a model. It's with Grock. It's trying to
21:42
say solve for artificial general
21:45
intelligence with a massive amount of AI
21:48
training compute and inference compute.
21:51
For example, Grock 5 will actually only
21:53
run effectively on a GV300. That's
21:56
that's how much of a beast that Grock 5
21:58
is. Whereas Tesla's models are maybe
22:01
about less than 10% the size, maybe
22:04
closer to 5% the size of Grog. So
22:09
yeah, they're really coming at the
22:11
problem from very different angles. XA
22:13
and Grock, you know, they're competing
22:16
with Google Gemini and opening ad chatbt
22:19
and that kind of thing. And so some of
22:20
it's complimentary. I mean, for example,
22:22
for Grock voice, being able to interact
22:24
with Grock in the car is cool. Grock for
22:27
Optimus voice recognition and voice
22:30
generation is Grock. So that's helpful
22:32
there. But they are coming at it from
22:34
kind of opposite ends of the spectrum. I
22:36
think even if the regulators weren't
22:37
making us do it, we'd still do that as
22:39
the right sort of caut cautious approach
22:42
to a new market. So just to make sure
22:44
that we're being paranoid about safety,
22:47
I think it makes sense to have a safety
22:49
driver or safety occupant in the car
22:51
when we first go to new markets to
22:53
confirm that there's not something we're
22:54
missing because all it takes is like one
22:57
in 10,000 trips to go wrong and you got
22:59
an issue. So it just to make sure like
23:02
is there some peculiarity about a city
23:04
like a very difficult intersection or
23:06
something that's an unexpected challenge
23:10
in a city for that one in 10,000
23:12
situation and I think we probably could
23:14
just let it loose in these cities but we
23:16
don't want to take a chance and you know
23:17
what we're talking about here is maybe 3
23:19
months of safety driver in a new metro
23:22
to confirm that it's good and then we
23:24
take the safety driver out that kind of
23:25
thing. Now the first priority when we
23:27
release a major new software
23:30
architecture for autopilot is safety. So
23:33
it starts off with safety obviously
23:36
safety prioritized and then we solve
23:38
comfort thereafter which is why I don't
23:40
recommend people take the initial
23:42
version like that's why I said most
23:44
people should wait until 14.2 before
23:47
they actually download a version 14
23:50
because by 14.2 we'll have addressed
23:52
many of the comfort issues. the priority
23:54
is very much safety first and then
23:57
thereafter the comfort issues. That's
23:59
why most people I'm like I probably
24:01
it'll be a little like it'll be safe but
24:04
jerky. We just need time to kind of
24:07
smooth the rough edges and soul for
24:09
comfort in addition to safety with a
24:11
major news autopilot architecture
24:13
change. I I know what the road map is
24:16
for the Tesla real world AI and at a
24:18
very granular detail obviously Ashok is
24:20
leading that. I spent a lot of time with
24:22
the team going in excruciating detail
24:25
here on what we're doing to improve the
24:27
real world AI. This car is going to feel
24:29
like it is a living creature and that's
24:31
with AI4 before even AI 5. As I
24:33
mentioned earlier, we'll be adding
24:34
reasoning to I don't know sh is that
24:37
like reasoning in like 14.3 maybe 14.4
24:40
something like that by this year for
24:42
sure.
24:43
So with reasoning it's literally going
24:45
to think about which parking spot to
24:46
pick. It's going to say this is the
24:48
entrance, but actually probably there's
24:50
not a parking spot right at the
24:52
entrance. If the parking lot is fairly
24:53
full, the probability of a an open
24:55
parking spot right at the entrance is
24:56
very low. But actually, what it'll do is
24:58
drop you off at the entrance of the
25:00
store and then go find a parking spot.
25:02
It's going to get very smart about
25:04
figuring out a parking spot. It's going
25:05
to spot figure out it's going to spot
25:07
empty spots much better than human. It's
25:10
got 360°ree vision and it's going to use
25:13
reasoning to solve things. Yeah, that's
25:15
why I said like I have a pretty good
25:17
understanding of like AI, you know, the
25:19
sort of the giant model level with Grock
25:22
and with Tesla and like I'm confident in
25:24
saying that Tesla has the the Tesla AI
25:26
has the highest intelligence density.
25:28
When you look at the the intelligence
25:29
per gigabyte, I think like Tesla AI is
25:32
probably an order of magnitude better
25:34
than anyone else and doesn't have any
25:36
choice because that that AI has got to
25:38
fit in the AI4 computer. The discipline
25:41
of having that level of AI intelligence
25:44
density will pay great dividends when
25:47
you go to something that has an order of
25:49
magnitude more capability like AI5. Now
25:51
you have that same intelligence density,
25:52
but you got 10 times more capability in
25:54
the computer. Well, we're not the
25:55
hardware design will not actually be
25:57
frozen even through startup production.
26:00
There'll be continued iteration because
26:02
a bunch of the things that you discover
26:04
are very difficult to make. You only
26:06
find that pretty late in the game. So
26:08
we'll be doing rolling changes for the
26:10
Optimus design even after solder
26:12
production. But I do think that the new
26:14
hand is an incredible piece of
26:17
engineering and that's we'll have a
26:20
production intent prototype ready to
26:24
show off in Q1 probably February or
26:26
March and then we're going to be
26:28
building a million unit Optimus
26:31
production line hopefully with a
26:33
production start towards the end of next
26:35
year. But that production ramp will take
26:37
a while to get to annualized rate of a
26:39
million because it's going to move as
26:41
fast as the slowest least lucky thing
26:44
out of 10,000 unique items. But it will
26:47
get to a million units. And then
26:50
ultimately we'll do Optimus
26:53
4. That'll be 10 million units. Optimus
26:57
5 maybe 50 to 100 million units. I mean
26:59
it's really pretty nutty. The point is
27:02
that there needs to be enough voting
27:03
control to give a strong influence, but
27:04
not so much that I can't be fired if I
27:06
go insane. And I think that sort of
27:08
number is in the mid 20s approximately.
27:10
As a company that has already gone
27:12
public, we've investigated every
27:13
possible way to achieve increased voting
27:16
control without, you know, is there some
27:18
way to have a super voting stock, but
27:19
there really is there is no way to have
27:21
a super voting stock after you've gone
27:23
public. For example, Google, Meta, many
27:27
other companies have this, but they had
27:29
it before they went public and so it
27:32
sort of gets grandfathered in. Tesla
27:34
does not have that. So, it's just I just
27:39
don't feel comfortable building a robot
27:40
army here and then being ousted because
27:43
of some asine recommendations from ISS
27:46
and Glass Lewis who have no freaking
27:48
clue. Those guys are corporate
27:50
terrorists. Let me explain the core
27:52
problem here. So many of the index
27:54
funds, the passive funds vote along the
27:57
lines of whatever Glass Lewis and ISS
28:01
recommend.
28:03
They have made many terrible
28:04
recommendations in the past that if
28:07
those recommendations have been followed
28:08
would have been extremely destructive to
28:10
the future of the company. But if you've
28:12
got passive funds that defer
28:14
responsibility for the vote to Glass
28:17
Lewis and ISS, then you can have
28:20
extremely disastrous consequences for a
28:22
publicly traded company if too much of
28:24
the publicly traded company is
28:26
controlled by index funds. It's de facto
28:29
controlled by glass lewis and ISS. This
28:31
is a fundamental problem for corporate
28:34
government because they're not voting
28:36
along the lines that are actually good
28:38
for shareholders. That's the big issue.
28:39
ISS glass corporate terrorism.
