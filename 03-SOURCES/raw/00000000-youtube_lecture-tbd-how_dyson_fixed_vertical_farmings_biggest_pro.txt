I made a video a few years ago after doing some research and realizing that a lot of vertical farms were going bankrupt. It was a surprising and sobering look at some of the economics that made a seemingly good idea not actually work. But again I was shocked to see that there actually is a company making this work, and of all companies DYSON the vacuum cleaner company! I've always been a huge fan of Sir James Dyson and love his approach to engineering, so this was fun to research. And stay to the end because I realized something really shocking that many probably don't realize, so let's see if Dyson can solve the Vertical Farming Problem.

2 years ago, I stood right here and told you  that the multi-billion dollar vertical farming  
0:03
industry was an epic failure. But the world's  most famous vacuum company just proved us wrong.  
0:08
Or did they? Since that video, the industry has  absolutely been decimated. Plenty after raising  
0:13
billions of dollars in investment have gone  bankrupt. Bowery Farming, Aerrows, AppH Harvest,  
0:18
all of them gone or reorganized. Investment in  the Set has fallen by over 90%. And this is a  
0:23
story of how the guys who completely reinvented  the humble vacuum cleaner might have just done the  
0:28
same thing for vertical farming. It's also a story  of how by digging through the numbers, we found  
0:32
a secret that changes everything. Let's figure  this out together. I'm Ricky and this is Two Bit  
0:37
Da Vinci. This video is brought to you by Delete  Me. So, how did a vacuum cleaner company succeed  
0:44
where hundreds of specialized startups backed by  billions of dollars fail? Well, by identifying  
0:49
the exact engineering sins that I talked about in  that previous video we'll link above and solving  
0:55
them one by one. The biggest problem was always  the astronomical energy cost. Vertical farms  
1:00
were basically giant windowless warehouses that  had to replicate the power of the sun 24/7 using  
1:06
thousands of high-powered LEDs. It was incredibly  expensive and it couldn't compete with open field  
1:11
or greenhouse farming which gets all of its light  for free. Dyson's solution is deceptively simple.  
1:17
use as much sunlight as possible. Instead of a  black box, they built a massive 26 acre glass  
1:23
house. But here's the genius part. Inside, they  have these enormous rotating rigs. We're talking  
1:28
almost 80 ft long and 18 ft tall that look like  ferris wheels for plants. These rigs slowly turn,  
1:35
ensuring every single strawberry plant gets  the maximum possible amount of natural free  
1:40
sunlight throughout the day. LEDs are only used to  supplement light on cloudy days and in the shorter  
1:46
winter months, not as a primary source. This  single change slashes their energy demand for  
1:52
lighting, which accounts for over half the power  usage in a traditional vertical farm. The next  
1:58
fatal flaw was a broken business model. Vertical  farm startups were burning cash trying to compete  
2:03
with dirt cheap fieldgrown lettuce. They were  growing a low-value crop with a highcost method.  
2:09
Dyson flipped the script. They targeted a premium  high-value crop, strawberries. 250 grams of Dyson  
2:16
farm strawberries sell today for $4.50, which  is around $11 per pound. Lettuce in the UK,  
2:23
on the other hand, cost 40 cents per 100 g or  $2.40 per pound, under a quarter the value.  
2:30
Without automation, vertical farms are very labor  intensive. I found that a 1,000 meter vertical  
2:35
lettuce farm requires about 16,000 to 20,000  man-h hours per year to operate. That's 34 to 42  
2:42
full-time workers per acre. For instance, Plenty,  the famous $1 billion California-based vertical  
2:47
farm company that filed for bankruptcy in 2024,  employed 80 full-time workers for his 100,000t  
2:53
vertical farm in Compton, which works out to about  35 workers per acre. Dyson used its experience in  
2:59
technology and manufacturing to automate most of  the farming operations, requiring only 83 workers  
3:04
for its entire 26 acre glass house. That's only  3 to four workers per acre, onetenth of what the  
3:11
other vertical farms employed. Now, I know there  are some other more advanced vertical farms that  
3:16
also rely heavily on automation and reduce worker  operational needs, but we're comparing Dyson here  
3:22
to the spectacular failures that we covered  in our previous video. It's easy for diseases  
3:26
to spread in enclosed environments. Just think  back to CO to see what I mean. This is a major  
3:32
risk for both traditional green houses and  vertical farms. For example, in May 2023,  
3:37
a leaf feeding pathogen called phytothora infected  Bowery farms and quickly spread, killing a large  
3:43
swath of its crops and eventually bringing down  the $2.3 billion company. In contrast, Dyson  
3:49
controls this risk with advanced automation and  pest control. Robots handle strawberry picking,  
3:54
UV systems kill mold, and the system even releases  live insects in precise locations to control  
4:00
aphids and other pests. This reduces manual labor  and proactively manages disease risk inherent in  
4:07
any controlled environment. I just knew we had to  make this video because Dyson is a company I love  
4:12
and trust. And Trust is a rare commodity these  days online and why I've been a member of Delete

5:08
Huge thanks to Delete Me and you. Now back to the  show. The farm also relies on custommade in-house  
5:14
sensor packs to control humidity, temperature, and  CO2 levels. And they even have a special Apogee  
5:19
P sensor which can measure the amount of light in  a specific wavelength for crops like strawberries  
5:24
and supplement it with LED lighting just to  provide the optimal amount of light needed.  
5:28
and save on cost. So, that's a quick rundown  on how Dyson overcame vertical farming's key  
5:34
challenges. But they didn't stop there because the  strawberry farm is a part of a larger system. I'll  
5:39
tell you right now, that's one of the biggest  strengths that really makes this whole thing  
5:42
work. But it's also where things became a little  more misleading and one of the reasons why I don't  
5:47
think that Dyson fully solved vertical farming.  But we'll get back to that here in a minute.  
5:52
Dyson's hybrid vertical farm is part of a true  circular economic system. Now, this next part is  
5:56
vital. Right next to the greenhouse, they built an  anorobic digtor. It's basically a giant mechanical  
6:03
stomach. They feed it biomass from Dyson's other  traditional farming operations, and it digests it  
6:08
to produce bio gas. That bio gas powers a turbine  that generates all the electricity for the farm  
6:13
and then some. So, the entire automated robotic  vertical farm doesn't spend a dime on energy.  
6:18
It's all generated inhouse. What's even more  clever is that the waste heat from the turbine  
6:23
is piped directly into the greenhouse to keep the  strawberries warm. This directly eliminates about  
6:27
10% of the energy a typical greenhouse or vertical  farm consumes. And the CO2 from the exhaust also  
6:33
piped into the greenhouse where the plants breathe  it and turn it into fresh strawberries and other  
6:39
biomass. It's pretty much a carbon capture system  from the bio gas power plant. Remember the CO2 we  
6:45
talk about as a bad thing, but it is literally  plant food. And in this particular scenario,  
6:50
that synergy is insanely brilliant. Now rain  water is collected from the roof for irrigation,  
6:55
which is pretty standard. And the end result is  a nearly perfectly closed loop system where every  
7:00
waist stream becomes a valuable input. Okay, so  a billionaire figured out how to grow expensive  
7:05
strawberries in a fancy greenhouse. Why should we  care? Well, because this isn't just about fruit.  
7:11
It's a potential blueprint for a more resilient  and sustainable food system. Think about it.  
7:16
The US gets a huge portion of its fresh fruits and  vegetables from places like California and Mexico.  
7:21
When a drought hits California or a trade issue  complicates imports, prices for everyone go up and  
7:27
shelves can go empty. The promise of a system like  Dyson's is local food security. It's the ability  
7:32
to grow produce year round right outside of major  cities using a fraction of the land with higher  
7:37
yields and less water. Dyson Farms produces 48  tons of strawberries per acre. The average US farm  
7:44
just 23 tons. Even California with its perfect  climate only gets 31 tons. Dyson is producing  
7:52
over 50% more than the best farms in the world and  250% more than local British farms. For example,  
7:59
farms that Dyson is competing with directly. And  they're doing this, at least this first iteration,  
8:05
in the notoriously cloudy and gray UK. That is  a gamecher. To understand how this happened,  
8:12
we have to understand Sir James Dyson. Most  people probably know him for the bagless cyclone  
8:17
vacuum that made him the fifth richest person  in the UK. But at his core, he's a relentless  
8:22
hands-on engineer. And about a decade ago,  he started buying land, a lot of land. Today,  
8:28
Dyson Farming owns 36,000 acres of prime English  farmland. The average farm in the UK is just over  
8:33
200 acres. Dyson's operation is the size of 177  of those farms stitched together, making him the  
8:40
single largest and most technologically advanced  farming business in the country. And this is the  
8:45
most critical point. Dyson Farming isn't a  startup. It wasn't funded by Silicon Valley  
8:50
venture capitalists demanding hockey stick growth  and a quick exit. It's a long-term privately  
8:55
funded project by an engineer who spent 15 years  and over 5,000 prototypes perfecting his first  
9:01
vacuum. He's applied the same slow, methodical,  iterative approach to agriculture. The vertical  
9:07
farm wasn't a wild bet. It was a logical  next step for an already massive, profitable,  
9:12
and high-tech farming operation that turned over  42.2 million euros in profit last year. Dyson is  
9:17
treating farming like manufacturing, focusing  on precision, efficiency, and quality control.  
9:22
This foundation of patient capital and deep  agricultural experience is what allowed him  
9:27
to build a system designed to work for decades,  not just to look good in a pitch deck. Okay,  
9:32
so on the surface, it looks like a genius move.  A perfect closed loop system that finally makes  
9:38
vertical farming profitable. By pure logic, this  should spend less energy and be cheaper to run.  
9:43
And the yields are great. But I'm an engineer  and I wanted to see the numbers because, well,  
9:48
sometimes the devil is in the details. And when  I started digging into these numbers, I found  
9:52
something that was completely off. Something that  changes this entire story. Here's what happened. I  
9:57
wanted to compare the actual energy consumption  of Dyson Strawberry Glass House with the failed  
10:02
billion-dollar vertical farms to see just how big  the difference really was. And needless to say,  
10:08
those numbers aren't readily available. So, I had  to do some calculations. Since the glass house is  
10:13
a closed system that pulls all of its energy  from the adjacent bio gas turbine. And since  
10:18
Dyson publicly states that the system produces  enough electricity to power 10,000 UK homes,  
10:23
I figured I could probably work my way  backward. But when I did the estimates,  
10:26
the numbers didn't add up. Not by a long shot.  Here's the breakdown. The average UK household  
10:31
uses about 2700 kwatt hours of electricity  per year. Those are the official numbers.  
10:36
So powering 10,000 homes would mean Dyson Systems  produces 27 million kwatt hours or 27 gawatt hours  
10:43
annually. Now there's no reason to think that  every single kilowatt hour of energy produced was  
10:48
actually consumed. They might have sent it back to  the grid. But how could we possibly find that out?  
10:53
Well, it turns out it was actually pretty easy.  Looking through their financial records for 2024,  
10:57
which unlike in the US, private companies in  the UK are legally required to make public.  
11:02
The record details how much energy Dyson sold  to the UK grid. $10.87 million worth of energy  
11:08
in 2023 and $9.37 million worth in 2024. Based  on the average wholesale electricity prices in  
11:14
the UK for 2023 2024, the revenue means that they  exported 100 to 114 gatt hours per year, not 27.  
11:23
This isn't exactly a rounding error. I dug deep  to see if there was a flaw in the calculations,  
11:28
but it's all pretty straightforward. And this is  really strange. I mean, think about it. The amount  
11:33
of electricity Dyson actually sold to the grid  was over four times higher than the total amount  
11:38
they claimed their system can even produce. Why  would a company do that? Why would you downplay  
11:43
just how much power you could produce? I think  I might have the answer, and we will get to that  
11:47
here in a minute. Just for now, know that that  10,000 UK homes figure is totally off, and we  
11:52
can't use it to calculate the glass houses's  energy consumption. So, what do we do? Well,  
11:57
I decided to make an educated guess. Dyson says  the glass houses use a small fraction of the power  
12:02
the anorobic digesttors produce. If we put that  fraction at let's say 10% around 1.14 gwatt hours  
12:09
it would mean that Dyson vertical farms consumes  about 9 kwatt hours per kilogram of strawberries.  
12:14
Is that high? Low? Turns out this number actually  makes a lot of sense. A 2021 global report on  
12:20
controlled environment agriculture found that  normal green houses consume an average of 5.4  
12:25
kwatt hours per kilogram of produce. So when  you factor in that Dyson doesn't have to run  
12:30
supplemental LED lighting quite as much. It  gets heat for free from the bio gas ingesttor.  
12:34
This kind of makes sense and I'd probably put  the consumption around 7 to 15 kwatt hours per  
12:39
kilogram. Now this part is staggering. Vertical  farms of the past average 38.8 kwatt hours per  
12:46
kilogram for simple leafy greens like lettuce. For  a more energyintensive fruing crop with a longer  
12:52
crop cycle like strawberries, the consumption  would have easily been two to three times higher,  
12:56
likely in the range of 75 to over 100 kwatt hours  per kilogram. Dyson's hybrid system uses a tenth  
13:03
of that energy, a 90% reduction in energy use,  and that's pretty amazing. So clearly, their  
13:10
hybrid approach and all the other innovations  that they've employed here make a ton of sense.  
13:14
But let's go back to that previous question.  Why would you downplay how much energy you  
13:19
can produce? Companies don't usually do that. In  fact, private companies usually do the opposite,  
13:24
bloating about their numbers. And then I started  thinking about a video we did recently about a  
13:29
concept in desalination where a company was going  to produce energy and sell that to offset the cost  
13:34
to bring the cost for the desided water in line  with water prices today. And I think that kind  
13:41
of gets to the heart of this. There was a quote I  read in a specialized farming publication from an  
13:45
engineer working at Dyson who said that half the  profits from the integrated vertical farm come not  
13:50
from the berries but from the sale of electricity  generated by the bio gas plants. That would mean  
13:55
that in a way the strawberries are a byproduct of  this entire process. And suddenly things start to  
14:00
make a lot more sense. Dyson strawberries are  already sold in the UK at a premium price more  
14:05
than double that of supermarket strawberries  because they're more expensive to grow. Despite  
14:09
the extra yield, they still consume a lot  more energy than when growing in a greenhouse,  
14:13
which has always been the bane of vertical  farming. Dyson's business model covers  
14:18
part of the cost by using the electricity  produced by the anorobic digesttors. Yet,  
14:23
they still have to sell the strawberries at  twice the price to make any real profit. So,  
14:28
the reality is electricity generation is equally  responsible for the profitability of the system  
14:34
as is the crops that they actually produce. Or  put another way, without the energy subsidy,  
14:39
the strawberries would be way too expensive to  sell. But is that a bad thing? And I think the  
14:45
answer is absolutely not. Cuz the bio gas reactor  would probably be leaking methane out naturally  
14:51
from anorobic processes in nature by itself for  no value. Instead, we're benefiting from that and  
14:57
using that energy. And two, the carbon dioxide  that is emitted from the process doesn't just  
15:02
go into the atmosphere. It gets fed into these  glass houses where they go into creating the  
15:08
makeup of the plants themselves and at the end of  the day we get electricity and crops. One of the  
15:14
things that I've always mentioned is there are  technologies that don't make commercial viable  
15:19
economic sense today that we still need to invest  in. Desalination comes to mind and maybe vertical  
15:24
farming is the second. So even though they don't  make financial sense today, a cheap strawberry  
15:30
grown in a natural field is less expensive.  True, but what happens if a volcano erupts and  
15:37
we're in a four-year nuclear winter and we have no  sunlight for four years? What happens to mankind,  
15:42
right? Vertical farms could potentially still  work with a nuclear reactor and, you know,  
15:46
something else and artificial lighting. These  are things that just matter. Deselination is  
15:50
kind of the same way. So, I got to say, pretty  genius. I think Dyson's got something here. And  
15:55
I think this model of producing energy is actually  something all farmers could benefit from. putting  
16:00
solar panel arrays along fields, agrophotovoltaic  farming where you mix in crops and yields along  
16:06
with solar panels. These are things that can  offset the incredibly difficult economics of  
16:11
farming and give farmers more stability. But what  do you think? What do you think about the story  
16:16
and this approach to vertical farming? Sound off  in the comments below. And until next week, check  
16:21
out this video that we think you'll love. I'm Rick  Tuba Da Vinci. Thank you so much for watching.
