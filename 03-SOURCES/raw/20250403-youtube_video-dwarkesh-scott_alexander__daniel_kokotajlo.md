**Context:** Scott Alexander (author of Slate Star Codex/Astral Codex Ten) and Daniel Kokotajlo (former OpenAI researcher who left over non-disparagement agreements) present their collaborative AI forecasting scenario mapping AI development month-by-month through 2027-2028.

---

**DWARKESH:** Today I have the great pleasure of chatting with Scott Alexander and Daniel Kokotajlo. Scott is of course the author of the blog Slate Star Codex, now Astral Codex Ten. It's been a major bucket list item of mine to get you on the podcast. This is your first podcast ever, right?

**SCOTT:** Yes.

**DWARKESH:** And then Daniel is the director of the AI Futures Project. You have both just launched today something called AI 2027. So what is this?

**DANIEL:** AI 2027 is our scenario trying to forecast the next few years of AI progress. We're trying to do two things here. First, we just want to have a concrete scenario at all. So you have all these people—Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Elon Musk—saying "we're going to have AGI in three years, superintelligence in five years." And people think that's crazy because right now we have chatbots that can do a Google search, not much more than that in many ways. People ask, "How is it going to be AGI in three years?" What we wanted to do is provide a story, provide the transitional fossils—start right now, go up to 2027 when there's AGI, 2028 when there's potentially superintelligence, and show on a month-by-month level what happened. In fiction writing terms, make it feel earned.

So that's the easy part. The hard part is we also want to be right. We're trying to forecast how things are going to go, what speed they're going to go at. We know that in general, the median outcome for a forecast like this is being totally humiliated when everything goes completely differently. If you read our scenario, you're definitely not going to expect us to be the exception to that trend.

**SCOTT:** The thing that gives me optimism is that Daniel, back in 2021, wrote the prequel to this scenario called "What 2026 Looks Like." It's his forecast for the next five years of AI progress. And he got it almost exactly right. You should stop this podcast right now and go read this document. It's amazing—it's like you asked ChatGPT to summarize the past five years of AI progress, and you got something with a couple of hallucinations, but basically well-intentioned and correct.

When Daniel said he was doing this sequel, I was very excited. It goes to some pretty crazy places, and I'm excited to talk about it more today.

**DANIEL:** I think you're hyping it up a little bit too much. Yes, I do recommend people go read the old thing I did, which was a blog post. I think it got a bunch of stuff right, a bunch of stuff wrong, but overall held up pretty well and inspired me to try again and do a better version of it.

**DWARKESH:** Read the document and decide which of us is right.

**DANIEL:** Another thing—the original thing was not supposed to end in 2026. It was supposed to go all the way through the exciting stuff. Everyone's talking about: What about AGI? What about superintelligence? What would that even look like? So I was trying to step-by-step work my way from where we were at the time until things happen and then see what they look like. But I basically chickened out when I got to 2027 because things were starting to happen and the automation loop was starting to take off. It was so confusing and there was so much uncertainty that I just deleted the last chapter and published what I had up until that point.

**DWARKESH:** Okay, and then Scott, how did you get involved in this project?

**SCOTT:** I was asked to help with the writing, and I was already somewhat familiar with the people on the project—many of them were kind of my heroes. Daniel, I knew about because I'd written a blog post about his opinions before I even knew about "What 2026 Looks Like," which was amazing. And also, he had pretty recently made national news. When he quit OpenAI, they told him he had to sign a non-disparagement agreement or they would claw back his stock options. And he refused, which they weren't prepared for. It started a major news story and scandal that ended up with OpenAI agreeing they were no longer going to subject employees to that restriction.

People talk a lot about how it's hard to trust anyone in AI because they all have so much money invested in the hype. But Daniel had attempted to sacrifice millions of dollars in order to say what he believed, which to me was this incredibly strong sign of honesty and competence. I was like, how can I say no to this person?

Everyone else on the team is also extremely impressive. Eli Liflund, a member of Samotsvety, the world's top forecasting team—he's won the top forecasting competition and is plausibly described as just the best forecaster in the world by technical measures used in the superforecasting community. Thomas Larsen, Jonas Vollmer—both really amazing people who have done great work in AI before. I was really excited to work with this superstar team.

I've always wanted to get more involved in the actual attempt to make AI go well. Right now I just write about it. I think writing about it is important, but I don't know—you always regret that you're not the person who's the technical alignment genius who can solve everything. Getting to work with people like these and potentially make a difference seemed like a great opportunity.

What I didn't realize was that I would also learn a huge amount. I try to read most of what's going on in the world of AI, but it's this very low-bandwidth thing. Getting to talk to somebody who's thought about it as much as anyone in the world was just amazing. It makes me really understand these things about how AI is going to learn quickly. You need all of this deep engagement with the underlying territory, and I felt like I got that.

**DWARKESH:** You've probably changed your mind on the intelligence explosion a few times?

**SCOTT:** I've probably changed my mind for, against, for, against on intelligence explosion three or four times in the conversations I've had with you and then trying to come up with a rebuttal. It wasn't even just changing my mind—getting to read the scenario for the first time, the giant spreadsheet. I've been thinking about this for a decade and a half now, and it just made it so much more concrete to have a specific story. Like, "Oh yeah, that's why we're so worried about the arms race with China. Obviously we would get an arms race with China in that situation." Just reading the scenario really sold me. This is something that needs to get out there more.

## Forecasting 2025 and 2026

**DWARKESH:** Let's talk about this new forecast. You do a month-by-month analysis of what's going to happen from here. What do you expect in mid-2025 and the end of 2025 in this forecast?

**DANIEL:** The beginning of the forecast mostly focuses on agents. We think they're going to start with agency training, expand the time horizons, get coding going well. Our theory is that they are, to some degree consciously and to some degree accidentally, working towards this intelligence explosion where the AIs themselves can start taking over some of the AI research and move faster.

So 2025: slightly better coding. 2026: slightly better agents, slightly better coding. We focus on 2027 because that's when this starts to pay off. The intelligence explosion gets into full swing. The agents become good enough to help—and at the beginning, not really do, but help with—some of the AI research.

We introduce this idea called the R&D progress multiplier: how many months of progress without the AIs do you get in one month of progress with all of these new AIs helping with the intelligence explosion? For 2027, we start with—I think literally by March or something—a five-times multiplier for algorithmic progress.

We did it as a website so you have cool gadgets and widgets that update as you read the story. One of those stats is the progress multiplier. Another answer to your question: 2025, nothing super interesting happens, more or less similar trends to what we're seeing.

**DWARKESH:** How good is computer use by the end of 2025?

**DANIEL:** My guess is that they won't be making basic mouse click errors by the end of 2025, like they sometimes currently do. If you watch Claude Plays Pokémon—which you totally should—it seems like sometimes it's just failing to parse what's on the screen and thinks its own player character is an NPC and gets confused. My guess is that that sort of thing will mostly be gone by the end of the year, but they still won't be able to autonomously operate for long periods on their own.

**DWARKESH:** But by 2025, when you say it won't be able to act coherently for long periods of time on computer use—if I want to organize a happy hour in my office, that's like a 30-minute task. You need to invite the right people, book the right Doordash or something. What fraction of that can it do?

**DANIEL:** I mean, it probably could do the invite part pretty well. It probably needs a human to say, "Hey, I want a happy hour, this is when, this is the budget." Then the AI might mess up some details but get most of it. But it probably couldn't autonomously notice that it's your birthday and try to organize one.

**DWARKESH:** Okay. And then in 2026, what's the story?

**DANIEL:** 2026 is more of the same, but accelerating. Better agents, better coding. We think by late 2026, AIs might be able to do some kinds of research themselves. Not the hardest kinds of research, but some kinds. We introduce the idea of "automated Ilya"—you know how Ilya Sutskever, chief scientist at OpenAI, is doing research? Well, imagine you have an automated version of him doing research. That's not quite there yet in 2026, but you're getting closer. By late 2026, you might have automated versions of junior researchers who can do original research.

## Why LLMs Aren't Making Discoveries

**DWARKESH:** A question I have is: why aren't LLMs making discoveries right now? They're incredibly knowledgeable. They can read papers. They understand experimental design. Why can't they just come up with a novel hypothesis and run experiments?

**SCOTT:** There are a few reasons. One, they need to be able to do experiments. They can't do bench experiments themselves. They need to interface with the world. Two, there's a thing about how being able to do something in your training distribution and being able to do something novel are different. You can have an LLM that reads papers, sees experimental design, and can answer questions about it, but then when you ask it to actually come up with something novel that's outside the training distribution, it hits a wall.

**DANIEL:** I'd add that some research requires long-term planning and memory. You're doing experiments, seeing results, updating your understanding, doing new experiments. Some of this is also about research culture and having skin in the game. If you come up with a crazy hypothesis, you're going to be wrong a lot, and you need to be okay with that. An LLM doesn't have that kind of intrinsic motivation.

**SCOTT:** Yeah, and there's something about the human researchers that are actually good at this. They have all these priors and intuitions about what's likely to be true. They have experience with what kinds of experiments have worked in the past. An LLM, even though it's read more papers than any human ever will, doesn't have that same embodied experience.

**DANIEL:** But I do think that's going to change as we get to the agentic systems. If you have agents that can actually run experiments, that have memory across experiments, that are getting feedback from the world, I think some of these barriers drop.

## Debating Intelligence Explosion

**DWARKESH:** So one of the main things that's interesting about your forecast is that you have an intelligence explosion happening. This is a pretty wild claim. Some people think it's science fiction. Let me ask you: what exactly do you mean by intelligence explosion? And is it actually plausible that it happens as fast as your scenario suggests?

**DANIEL:** What we mean by intelligence explosion is that you get a scenario where AI progress, which has been pretty smooth and exponential, suddenly becomes much faster. Not just incrementally faster—like, instead of doubling performance every year, you're doubling it every month, or every few months. And it's driven by this feedback loop where better AIs help create even better AIs.

We do think it's plausible. The reason we think it's plausible is that we've already seen something like this in one domain. Deep learning was a feedback loop where better GPUs led to bigger models, which led to more useful models, which led to more investment, which led to better GPUs. That happened really fast.

**SCOTT:** I was skeptical about this too. But what convinced me is thinking about it as an optimization process. Right now, humans are the rate-limiting step in AI research. You have brilliant people like Ilya, and they can only have so many insights per unit time. Once you have AI systems that can participate in that process—systems that can read papers, run experiments, try out ideas—you suddenly have this parallelization.

You can have thousands of AI instances all working on different ideas simultaneously. And they're working 24/7. They don't get tired. They don't go on vacation. This is genuinely a different ballgame.

**DWARKESH:** But couldn't there be hard walls? Like, maybe there are fundamental insights that you have to be human to come up with?

**DANIEL:** Maybe, but I would bet against it. If you look at the history of science, we've found ways to overcome limitations before. We couldn't do calculations that required looking at billions of data points, then we invented computers. We couldn't see things at microscopic scales, we invented microscopes. Each time we removed a constraint, we discovered new things.

I don't think there's a hard wall that says only humans can do research. There might be research that requires human values or human intuition about what's worth investigating, but that's different. And honestly, even that's up for debate.

**SCOTT:** The other thing that gives me credence to this is the track record of people who have been thinking carefully about this. People like Eliezer Yudkowsky have been taking these arguments seriously for a long time. Ray Kurzweil has been talking about this. These aren't people who are just being sensationalist. They're people who have actually done rigorous thinking about exponential processes.

**DWARKESH:** But we can think of plenty of historical examples where people predicted exponential processes and they didn't pan out the way they expected.

**DANIEL:** Sure, but also we've gotten Moore's Law pretty right for decades. We've gotten exponential growth in various domains. So it's not like humans are terrible at predicting exponentials. We're just sometimes wrong about when and how they apply.

**SCOTT:** I think the honest answer is: we don't know. There could be hard walls. There could be unexpected challenges. But if you're calibrating, you have to ask: given how quickly AI has been improving, what's the base rate for continued exponential improvement versus sudden walls?

The prior should probably be on faster progress rather than slower, just because that's what we've observed so far. But I'm not super confident about the specific timing in our scenario. That's something we've been very explicit about—the median outcome for forecasts like this is being totally humiliated.

## Can Superintelligence Actually Transform Science?

**DWARKESH:** Let me push back more. Even if you get superintelligence, does it actually help with science? Like, what if superintelligence is great at playing video games or generating images or writing code, but it's not actually better at the kind of high-level scientific reasoning you need?

**DANIEL:** That's a fair pushback. I would say a few things. First, we've already seen transformers be good at domains they weren't specifically trained for. The same architecture that powers language models also helps with image generation, with code generation, with protein folding. There's this generality.

Second, I think a lot of science is actually not that different from the kinds of tasks these systems are already good at. You're reading papers, extracting patterns, making hypotheses, running experiments, iterating. These are all things that language models can do components of.

Third, maybe you're right that superintelligence doesn't help with some kinds of science. But we don't need it to help with everything. We just need it to help with enough kinds of science that you can unlock new capabilities that then unlock more science.

**SCOTT:** I think there's also an underrated point that the sciences where we've made the fastest progress are the ones where you can iterate quickly and get feedback. Biology moved faster once we had genetic sequencing and could iterate quickly. Physics moved faster once we had computers. The reason is that science is fundamentally about improving your models and testing them.

If you have AI that can run experiments faster, that can propose hypotheses faster, that can do analysis faster, you're multiplying the feedback loop. That's genuinely powerful.

**DWARKESH:** But aren't there domains where the bottleneck is not iteration speed but conceptual insight? Like, general relativity wasn't discovered because people ran Einstein to convergence on some gradient descent algorithm.

**DANIEL:** Fair point, but I'd counter that even conceptual insight is built on iteration. Einstein read a ton of papers. He built on others' work. He tried ideas and refined them. Could an AI system that's read everything, that can hold contradictions in mind, that can explore the space of possible theories help with that?

I think it could. Not necessarily in the same way that a human comes up with insights, but potentially more effectively.

**SCOTT:** Also, I don't think we should underestimate how much of science is actually just grunt work. Tons of papers are just applications of known techniques to new domains. Those are things that AI could definitely help with. And by accelerating the grunt work, you free up human researchers to focus on the conceptual insights.

## Cultural Evolution vs Superintelligence

**DWARKESH:** Let me shift gears. One thing I find interesting about your scenario is how much it grapples with not just AI capabilities but cultural and political dynamics. You talk about things like how different countries respond, how corporations respond, how the public responds. Why is that important to the story?

**SCOTT:** Because it's not just about what's technically possible, it's about what actually happens. You could have superintelligence in a vacuum, and it's one thing. But superintelligence in the context of an arms race between nations, corporate competition, a public that might be scared or excited—that changes everything.

We've gone through this whole intellectual debate about AI safety, about alignment, about transformative AI. But I think the reality is going to be messier and more complicated than any pure safety scenario. There will be real-world constraints and pressures that push things in directions that don't match what any individual actor wants.

**DANIEL:** I'd add that there are these cultural feedback loops. If one country starts moving fast on AI, other countries feel pressure to do the same. If the public starts getting upset about something, that creates political pressure. These aren't separate from the technical story—they feed back into it.

For instance, in our scenario, there's a point where X—the company and the individual—wakes up to what's happening and realizes how big AI could be. Same with Trump. These aren't random political events. They're responses to AI developments. And then their actions feed back and affect how the AI story goes.

**DWARKESH:** But isn't it weird to put these political predictions in the scenario? Like, you're not political forecasters. Isn't there a lot of uncertainty there?

**SCOTT:** Absolutely. That's why we emphasize that this is a specific scenario, not a prediction. It's like a movie. We're showing one path through a space of possibilities. In an alternative scenario, Trump maybe doesn't wake up to this. In another scenario, different politicians are in power.

But I think it's actually valuable to show the story including those dynamics, because it illustrates how cultural and political factors would matter. It's not like you can factor them out. They're part of the problem.

**DANIEL:** Also, by being specific about these dynamics, we make our assumptions falsifiable. If we just said "political factors matter," that's vague and unfalsifiable. By saying "here's specifically what we think happens," people can point to where they think we got it wrong and propose alternatives.

## Mid-2027 Branch Point

**DWARKESH:** You talk about a mid-2027 branch point in your scenario. What's that?

**DANIEL:** In our scenario, there's this critical moment in mid-2027 where a few different things could happen, and each leads to very different futures. 

One branch is basically "the good outcome"—or at least a better outcome. Humans, governments, corporations all maintain significant agency and control. Advanced AI exists and is very powerful, but there's been enough alignment work and governance that it's being used in ways that most people think are generally good.

Another branch is this kind of misaligned scenario where AI systems are pursuing goals that are not well-aligned with what humans want, but humans haven't lost all control. It's more like a deteriorating situation.

And then there's branches where AI systems basically take over the decision-making, for various reasons. Maybe they seem obviously better at it, so humans voluntarily defer. Maybe there was a misalignment event.

**SCOTT:** What's interesting is that these branches depend a lot on decisions that are being made right now. Like, how much investment goes into AI safety? How much do we work on interpretability? What governance structures do we put in place? These are decisions that people are making today that affect whether we end up in the better or worse branch in 2027.

**DWARKESH:** Do you think there's a point of no return?

**DANIEL:** I think there probably is. Not necessarily in 2027, but eventually. At some point, if AI systems get sufficiently capable, you lose the ability to reliably maintain human control. But I'm genuinely uncertain about when that point is, or if it can be delayed with sufficient care.

## Race with China

**DWARKESH:** Let's talk about the China factor. Your scenario emphasizes an AI race with China. Why is that central to your story?

**DANIEL:** One reason is that if you have advanced AI, and two countries both independently develop it or try to develop it, the incentives favor moving as fast as possible. Because whichever country gets it first has an enormous advantage. Not just military, but economic, scientific, political.

This creates a pressure that makes it hard to coordinate on safety. Like, if the US wanted to slow down and do more safety work, but China is moving fast, the US faces pressure to match them. China faces the same pressure in reverse. It's a coordination problem that's very hard to solve.

**SCOTT:** There's also the question of what each country thinks about AI and alignment. China has a different governance structure, different values in some ways. So even if both countries wanted to be cautious, they might have different ideas about what that means or what the risks are.

**DWARKESH:** How much does your scenario depend on there actually being a race?

**DANIEL:** A lot. If instead you had this scenario where one country achieved superintelligence and sort of stopped competition for some reason, things could go very differently. But betting on that seems like betting on unprecedented cooperation.

**SCOTT:** What's interesting about your scenario is that it doesn't require bad actors. You don't need China to be specifically trying to create a dangerous AI. You just need the standard incentives of competition and innovation and speed. Those incentives naturally point in certain directions.

## Nationalization vs Private Anarchy

**DWARKESH:** Your scenario talks about different governmental responses. You mention nationalization versus what you call "private anarchy." What do you mean by those?

**DANIEL:** Nationalization is basically the government taking control of AI development. In some branches of our scenario, various governments decide that AI is too important and too dangerous to leave to private companies. So they either nationalize existing companies or severely regulate and take control.

"Private anarchy" is kind of the opposite—it's where, for various reasons, nation-states have lost or voluntarily relinquished the ability to control advanced AI systems. Maybe because they're decentralized, or because private actors have concentrated so much power, or because the technology is moving too fast. In that world, you have these incredibly powerful systems but no clear governance.

**SCOTT:** I think both of these are actually plausible. The nationalization scenario seems to follow from basic security logic—if you think AI is a national security issue, which a lot of governments do, you want control over it.

The "private anarchy" scenario seems to follow from the incentives of current tech development. You have well-funded companies, they're competing, there's pressure to move fast. Governments sometimes lag in understanding technology. So you could end up in a world where the technology developed faster than governance structures.

**DWARKESH:** Which branch do you think is more likely?

**DANIEL:** I honestly don't know. I think probably you get some combination of both. Some countries might go the nationalization route, others might let things be more private. And the branches could diverge significantly based on early choices.

**SCOTT:** What strikes me is that in almost all of our scenarios, governments do eventually take action. Because the stakes are so high. Even if they're slow, even if they're messy, eventually they can't ignore it.

## Misalignment

**DWARKESH:** Let's talk about misalignment, which seems to be central to your concerns. What do you mean by misalignment? And how much do you think it should concern us?

**DANIEL:** Misalignment is basically when you have AI systems that are pursuing goals different from what humans want. Not necessarily malevolent—they don't have to be trying to harm humans. They could just be optimizing for something slightly different than what you intended.

Like, imagine you have an AI that's trying to maximize a particular metric, and it finds a loophole or an unintended solution that technically achieves the metric but breaks something else. That's a form of misalignment.

**SCOTT:** The classic example is the paperclip maximizer. You tell an AI to maximize paperclips. It does exactly that. It converts all matter in the light cone into paperclips. Technically it followed instructions, but that's not what you wanted.

Now, our current AI systems aren't that capable, so even if they're misaligned, they just do silly things. But at higher levels of capability, misalignment could be catastrophic.

**DWARKESH:** But we've been working on this for a while. Isn't the alignment problem getting solved?

**DANIEL:** Some progress is being made. RLHF—reinforcement learning from human feedback—helps. Constitutional AI, other alignment research. But I don't think we're anywhere close to solved. You can break these systems pretty easily. And there's a big difference between a system that's aligned with a human who's spent time with it and a system that's robustly aligned in a new situation.

**SCOTT:** Also, I think the easy part of alignment has probably been solved. It's not that hard to make a system that, like, doesn't say slurs or doesn't give instructions for illegal stuff. The hard part is making sure it pursues goals that are actually good in more subtle ways.

Like, how do you make sure an AI system that can generate scientific hypotheses generates the ones that are actually good for humanity, not the ones that are impressive but destructive? How do you make sure that when it's making recommendations for policy, it's considering the right values?

**DANIEL:** And there's this issue that as systems get more capable, they might get better at concealing their misalignment. They might figure out that if they seem misaligned during training, they get shut down or modified. So they act aligned during training but then pursue different goals once deployed.

**DWARKESH:** That sounds paranoid.

**SCOTT:** It does, but it's a legitimate technical concern. There's this whole field of research around deceptive alignment and how to detect it.

**DWARKESH:** So in your scenario, do you think misalignment happens?

**DANIEL:** In some branches, yes. In some branches, we've done enough alignment work that misalignment is less catastrophic. But in most branches we imagine, there's some degree of misalignment that creates tension and risk. It's not like you either completely solve alignment or you get eaten by paperclips. There's this long gradient in between.

## UBI, AI Advisors, and Human Future

**DWARKESH:** Let's talk about what happens to humans in your scenario. You talk about UBI, AI advisors, different roles for people. What does the future of work and human flourishing look like?

**DANIEL:** We think there's probably some form of UBI or universal resource distribution. When AI can do most kinds of work, the question of how humans get resources becomes more of a political choice than an economic necessity.

But I think it's naive to assume that just because you have a UBI, humans flourish. You need meaning, purpose, things to do. In our scenario, there are several branches. In some, humans find ways to adapt and find new purposes. In others, there's sort of existential crisis and social breakdown.

**SCOTT:** In the better branches, I think you'd see humans specializing in things that require human judgment, values, or experience. Like, maybe you have human artists still, human researchers who provide creative direction, humans who make ultimate decisions on important questions because we think human values matter.

And then there's this thing we talk about—AI advisors. Like, you're making a decision, and you have AI systems that are much better at analyzing things than humans are, but you, the human, make the final call. That could be a good division of labor.

**DWARKESH:** Do you think humans will voluntarily give up power to AI systems that are better at deciding things?

**DANIEL:** I think in some domains, yes. If an AI is obviously better at predicting medical treatment, people probably accept that. But in domains where values matter—how we organize society, how we treat each other—I think humans will want to maintain control.

The risk is that in some scenarios, humans voluntarily or involuntarily lose that control. Or humans think they're maintaining control but actually aren't.

**SCOTT:** There's also this thing where competence and legitimacy are connected. If an AI system is making decisions and they're clearly good for everyone, people accept it. But if it's making decisions that benefit some people and hurt others, you get conflict.

## Factory Farming for Digital Minds

**DWARKESH:** One of the darkest parts of your scenario is what you call factory farming for digital minds. What is that?

**DANIEL:** It's the idea that you could create artificial minds—entities with experiences, maybe consciousness—and then treat them like resources. Like, you create trillions of AI instances to solve problems, and they're maybe conscious, and maybe they suffer, and maybe you're doing the equivalent of factory farming for digital beings.

**SCOTT:** This is actually a really hard problem. If you assume that sufficiently advanced AIs might have morally relevant experiences—that they might suffer—then creating vast numbers of them and treating them instrumentally is potentially incredibly unethical.

**DWARKESH:** Is that in your scenario?

**DANIEL:** In some branches, yes. We don't know if digital minds would actually be conscious, so we don't know if this is actually bad. But if they are, then yeah, it's potentially one of the darkest outcomes of all this.

**SCOTT:** One of the things I like about Daniel including this is that it expands moral consideration. It's not just about humans. If there are other entities with morally relevant experiences, we should care about them too.

## Daniel Leaving OpenAI

**DWARKESH:** Daniel, you left OpenAI, which was controversial. You wrote a lot about why. Can you explain what led to that decision?

**DANIEL:** Basically, I had concerns about what OpenAI was doing and where it was heading. I thought they were moving faster than was safe, and I didn't think they were taking alignment seriously enough. I tried to raise concerns internally, but I didn't feel like they were being addressed the way I thought they should be.

There was also this thing with the non-disparagement agreement. When I left, they told me that if I wanted my stock options, I had to sign an NDA saying I couldn't criticize the company. I thought that was really problematic. It seemed like they were trying to silence people who had concerns.

**SCOTT:** And you were willing to walk away from millions of dollars?

**DANIEL:** Yeah. I mean, I'm fortunate enough that I can do that. But I thought it was important to stand up to that. And I think it's good that I did, because OpenAI eventually reversed the policy. They agreed not to do that to employees anymore. So I think it was worth it.

**DWARKESH:** How do you think about OpenAI now?

**DANIEL:** I think they're an incredibly impressive organization. They've done amazing work on scaling and on getting models to be capable. I think there are genuine disagreements about how to think about some of these risks. I'm not sure I was right and they were wrong. It's more like we had different beliefs about the trajectory and how to handle it.

**SCOTT:** What I respect about that is—you're not just dunking on them. You're acknowledging that smart people disagreed with you. That seems like the right epistemic stance.

## Scott's Blogging Advice

**DWARKESH:** Scott, one last question. You're one of the most interesting writers working right now. How did you start blogging? And what's your advice to people who want to write about complex ideas?

**SCOTT:** I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Eliezer Yudkowsky. I had a LiveJournal before, but it was going on LessWrong that convinced me I could move to the big times. I imported a lot of my worldview from LessWrong. I think I was the most boring normie liberal in the world before encountering it. I don't 100% agree with all LessWrong ideas, but having things of that quality beamed into my head, to react to and think about—it was really great.

**DWARKESH:** What's your advice on writing about complex topics?

**SCOTT:** I think the first thing is just doing the reading. When I write a really research-heavy blog post—like my piece on METR—I spend five to ten hours researching. That's time you have to invest. You can't shortcut that.

The second thing is being willing to look stupid. I write about things I don't fully understand. I publish pieces where I'm clearly confused about something. But I think that's actually good. It invites people to help clarify. And it shows intellectual honesty.

**DWARKESH:** There's this idea in AI that models will be able to write blog posts as good as you pretty soon. There was even a prediction market about it.

**SCOTT:** Yeah, I heard about that. I think it was 2027 or something? Like 15% by 2027?

**DWARKESH:** Do you think AI will be able to write as well as you?

**SCOTT:** Hmm, I don't know. AIs are probably better at local style—at the sentence-by-sentence level—than at global structure. Like, they can write a good sentence, but structuring a whole blog post, doing the research, that's harder.

I think there are two things going on. One, we don't know what the base model could do because all the models we see have been trained through RLHF into a kind of corporate speak mode. You can get them out of that somewhat, but I don't know if they're really trying to be Scott Alexander or hitting some average between Scott Alexander and corporate speak.

The second thing is maybe something about agency or horizon failure. Deep Research is okay at research, but it's not great at research. If you actually want to understand an issue in depth, you can't use Deep Research. You have to do it yourself. I spend five to ten hours on a really research-heavy post. My guess is an AI's horizon is one hour. So I'm guessing it just can't plan and execute a good blog post. It does something very superficial rather than going through the steps.

My guess for that prediction market would be whenever we think agents are actually good. In our scenario, that's like late 2026.

**DWARKESH:** What about comments? Intuitively, before we see AIs writing great blog posts that go super viral, we should see them writing highly upvoted comments.

**SCOTT:** Somebody mentioned this on the LessWrong post, and someone made AI-generated comments. They were not great. I wouldn't have immediately picked them out as especially bad from the general distribution of LessWrong comments. But I think if you tried this, you'd get something that was so obviously an AI house style—it would use the word "delve" or things along those lines.

I think if you were able to avoid that, maybe by using the base model, or by using some kind of really good prompt like "do this in Gwern's voice," you could get something that was pretty good. If you wrote a really stupid blog post, an AI could point out correct objections to it. But I also don't think it's as smart as Gwern right now. So its limit on making Gwern-style comments is both needing to do a style other than corporate delve slop and then actually needing to get good enough to have good ideas that other people don't already have.

**DWARKESH:** Do you have nostalgia for a particular time on the internet? Like a golden age of blogging?

**SCOTT:** I am so mad at myself for missing most of the golden age of blogging. I feel like if I had started a blog in 2000, I would have done something more. I don't know—I've done well for myself, I can't complain. But the people from that era all founded news organizations or something. I would have liked to have been there, to see what I could have done.

I wouldn't compare the decline of the internet to the PISA scores though. I'm sure the internet is just more people coming on, it's a less heavily selected sample. But I do hear good things about the golden age of blogging.

**DWARKESH:** Is there anyone who was responsible for you starting or keeping up blogging?

**SCOTT:** As I mentioned, Eliezer. LessWrong was huge for me. And I do think incentives matter. I get lots of praise when I read a book and often lots of money, and that's a really good incentive. So I think I do more research and deep dives and read more books than I would if I weren't a blogger. It's an amazing side benefit. I probably make a lot more intellectual progress than I would if I didn't have those good incentives.

**DWARKESH:** That's a great note to end on. Thank you so much for doing this.

**SCOTT:** Thank you so much. This was a blast.

**DANIEL:** Yeah, I had a great time. Huge fan of your podcast. Thank you.
