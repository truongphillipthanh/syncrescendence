Introduction
0:00
All right, chat. Today we're going to
0:01
talk about ADHD and sex. I've been
0:02
wanting to make this video for a long
0:04
time. I think a lot of times when we
0:05
talk about ADHD, we talk about things
0:07
like productivity. We talk about
0:09
academic achievement. We talk about
0:10
being able to focus and maybe do what
0:12
you want to do in life. But the truth of
0:14
the matter is that ADHD is a
0:16
neurodedevelopmental disorder. And what
0:18
that means is that the brains of people
0:19
with ADHD are different. And if your
0:21
brain is different, the way that you
0:23
engage with any activity that involves
0:26
your brain is going to be different. And
0:28
we don't talk enough about how ADHD
0:32
specifically impacts sex. So let's get
0:34
started with the first thing which is
ADHD Hyperfocus Courtship
0:36
ADHD hyperfocus courtship. So if we
0:38
think about ADHD, these people tend to
0:40
get into hyperfocus. They get really
0:42
obsessed with things. We get a nucleus
0:44
incumbent and vententral stratum that is
0:46
very susceptible to dopamine. So if
0:48
you're someone who's had ADHD or you've
0:51
been in a relationship with someone with
0:52
ADHD, what you'll notice is that falling
0:55
in love feels absolutely amazing.
0:57
Suddenly you're into this person. Oh my
0:59
god, this person is amazing. I love
1:01
spending time with them. We spend eight
1:02
hours together. We spend 10 hours
1:04
together. It's so awesome. The problem
1:06
is that that kind of feeling is driven
1:08
by this hyperfocus dopamineergic parts
1:11
of our brain. And in the same way that
1:13
we get hyperfocus in a particular thing
1:15
with ADHD and then never touch it again
1:18
once we lose that hyperfocus. The same
1:21
thing happens in relationships. So, from
1:23
the receiving end, it can be amazing to
1:26
be the recipient of someone with ADHD's
1:29
hyperfocus. They're thinking about you
1:31
all the time. They're obsessing over
1:32
you, but in a good way, right? They
1:34
think about what you need. They're like,
1:35
"Oh my god, you had such a hard day at
1:37
work today. Let me cook you dinner."
1:39
They're texting you all the time. Like,
1:40
it feels amazing to be on the receiving
1:43
end of this ADHD hyperfocus. And if you
1:46
have this ADHD hyperfocus, that also
1:48
feels amazing. You're like, "Oh my god,
1:50
this is the one." every interaction with
1:53
them releases dopamine in your brain.
1:56
So, it's not just that like you you like
1:58
them, but you're obsessed with them.
1:59
Even minor things, doing things for them
2:02
are are dopamineergically rewarding. And
2:04
it feels wonderful, right? If you if you
2:06
have ADHD, you know how luxurious and
2:09
awesome hyperfocus feels because your
2:12
mind is is finally focused. Instead of
2:14
being distracted by a million things,
2:16
you're like into this thing. And it
2:17
feels so good to be into this thing. The
2:20
problem is that the ADHD induced
2:22
hyperfocus, if that forms the foundation
2:24
of the relationship, when the hyperfocus
2:27
ends, both partners are left in a lurch.
2:30
It can feel kind of like a bait in
2:32
switch where suddenly this person is
2:34
like, "You were texting me all the time.
2:35
Now you're ghosting me completely." And
2:37
from the perspective of the ADHD person,
2:39
they no longer have the benefit of the
2:42
extra dopamine that they get from the
2:44
thrill of the chase. Like I've said, one
2:46
of the most frustrating things about OCD
2:48
is how often it gets misdiagnosed.
2:50
People can spend years trying to manage
2:53
anxiety, depression, or even something
2:54
else entirely without realizing that
2:57
underneath it all, it might actually be
2:59
OCD. And because it's so misunderstood,
3:02
it gets missed. Another study showed
3:04
something like 50% of people with OCD
3:07
get misdiagnosed at first, which means
3:09
they don't get the right kind of support
3:11
early on. And even when it is diagnosed,
3:13
not every therapist is trained in the
3:15
specific treatment that is effective for
3:17
OCD, like exposure and response
3:20
prevention or ERP. But here's the real
3:22
challenge. There's a shortage of OCD
3:25
specialists out there. That's where our
3:26
sponsor, NOCD, comes in. It's a telealth
3:29
platform that connects you with licensed
3:31
therapists who are trained specifically
3:34
in ERP. Our scientific advisory board
3:36
spent some time digging into NOCD's
3:38
clinical approach and how they handle
3:40
things like safety and escalation, and
3:43
they were genuinely impressed by the
3:44
level of rigor and understanding there.
3:46
So, if you're dealing with intrusive
3:48
thoughts, or you find yourself stuck in
3:50
loops of obsessive thinking or
3:52
repetitive behaviors, it might be worth
3:54
talking to someone who really knows what
3:56
to look for. 155 million Americans have
3:59
insurance that covers the cost of their
4:01
sessions, making it an affordable option
4:03
for therapy. They even offer in-app
4:05
support when you need help between
4:07
sessions, so you're never alone. You can
4:09
schedule a free 15minute call with NOCD
4:12
using the link in the description below.
4:15
When I work with my patients, what this
4:16
sort of feels like is I was super into
4:17
them, but I don't know what happened.
4:19
The spark just disappeared. So, when
4:21
we're talking about the spark in a
4:23
relationship, that is often times driven
4:25
by our dopamineergic circuitry, which
4:27
will gradually decline over time. The
4:30
first time you play a video game,
4:31
there's a burst of dopamine. But if you
4:33
play that game every single day, it's
4:34
not going to give you that same burst.
4:36
And so what do we do about this? This is
4:38
where I want y'all to understand that if
4:40
a particular part of your brain dictates
4:42
this relationship, the reason I'm in
4:44
this relationship is because one part of
4:46
my brain is hyperactive. What that means
4:48
is that the moment that that part of our
4:50
brain becomes deactivated, then my lust
4:54
for the relationship, no pun intended,
4:56
will also disappear. So this is why it's
4:58
important if you have ADHD and you're
5:00
dating someone to actually scale back
5:02
from that hyperfocus. So if we sort of
5:05
give into those parts like I I want to
5:07
text you every day, I want to text you
5:08
every day. I want to text you every day.
5:09
Some part of your brain is telling you
5:10
to text them every day. And if you give
5:12
into that, what you are doing is
5:14
listening to your brain. And if you are
5:16
listening to your brain, when your brain
5:17
tells you not to do something, you will
5:19
listen to that, too. So oddly enough,
5:21
what I tell people who who fall into
5:23
these relationships way too quickly is
5:25
to slow it down. Don't listen to it. I
5:27
know it's super exciting. I know you you
5:29
love it a lot. I know there's the thrill
5:30
of the chase, but if you want this
5:32
relationship to last, you've got to slow
5:35
it down. So, the way that I sort of
5:36
think about it is there is a certain
5:38
amount of dopamineergic thrill that you
5:41
get from this relationship. Do you want
5:43
to blow your load all at once, right? Do
5:45
you want to spend all of your thrill
5:48
right up front? And then generally
5:49
speaking, what we see in healthy
5:50
relationships is when we sort of
5:52
conserve some of that thrill to get us
5:55
through into 3 months, four months, 5
5:57
months, 6 months. And this is when other
5:59
pillars of the relationship will start
6:01
to form. Once those pillars are formed,
6:03
we will hopefully end up with a setup
6:05
that will lead to a healthy
6:06
relationship. The second thing that a
Tactile Defensiveness
6:08
lot of people don't understand is
6:09
something called tactile defensiveness.
6:11
Now remember, ADHD is a
6:12
neurodedevelopmental disorder, which
6:14
means that it alters the way that our
6:16
brain works. And one of the key things
6:17
that we're discovering more and more
6:18
about is that ADHD alters our perception
6:22
of physical stimuli. So it's not just
6:24
sounds and sights and things like that,
6:26
but the way that things feel in our
6:28
mouth. So a lot of times, you know,
6:29
people with ADHD will be very sensitive
6:31
to particular textures and also the way
6:33
that things feel in our body. So people
6:35
with ADHD may be very very sensitive to
6:37
things like swings and stuff like that
6:39
like in a good way. Moving your body
6:41
becomes really really important for
6:43
maintaining your focus. So if you tell a
6:46
kid with ADHD to sit still, it becomes
6:48
really really hard for them. Now
6:49
normally when we think about ADHD, we
6:51
think about things like sitting still in
6:52
class. But this actually enters the
6:55
realm of sexual relationship as well is
6:57
something called tactile defensiveness.
6:59
This is where particular ways that we
7:02
get touched may trigger responses that
7:05
are different from neurotypical people.
7:07
So for a neurotypical person, you know,
7:08
the way that they will touch you, they
7:11
touch you that way because when someone
7:13
touches them that way, their brain
7:15
interprets that touch in a pleasant way.
7:18
But often times what people with ADHD
7:20
will experience is like a lot of touch
7:22
will feel ticklish. People will feel
7:23
like super super hyper sensitive,
7:25
especially around erogynous zones or the
7:27
touch can even be perceived by your
7:29
brain as aggressive. So instead of
7:31
feeling comforted by a touch, your your
7:33
brain like you're kind of locks up. It's
7:35
like, oh, we're we're being attacked.
7:36
And this is because generally speaking,
7:38
there's a gating problem in the in the
7:40
brain. What that means is that the way
7:41
that our brain gates stimuli. So when I
7:43
get a stimulus, my brain will sort of
7:45
like lower it down a little bit or even
7:48
block it in that gating function is
7:50
impaired in ADHD. What this practically
7:52
looks like is a bewildering amount of
7:55
like sensitivity to touch. So, the
7:57
moment that you understand that tactile
7:59
defensiveness is an issue, that even
8:01
though your partner is touching you in a
8:02
particular way or if you're dating
8:04
someone with ADHD, if you're touching
8:05
them in a particular way and they don't
8:07
respond in the right way, be aware of
8:08
this principle. What the practical way
8:10
to deal with this is just to have a lot
8:12
of communication, a lot of dialogue, and
8:14
don't think take things personally when
8:16
there is a loving touch that is given
8:18
that is not received in a loving way.
Household Chores
8:20
Now, the third thing is incredibly
8:21
fascinating. So, if you're struggling to
8:23
have sex in a relationship, if the
8:26
intimacy in your relationship is gone,
8:27
if there's sort of a dead bedroom
8:29
syndrome and there's ADHD at play, this
8:31
is true of non ADHD as well. The culprit
8:33
could be household chores. So, this is
8:35
what's wild. Okay, so in a survey, 56%
8:39
of people said that I would feel sexier
8:41
if my ADHD partner helped me out more at
8:44
home. The Pew Center did a research
8:46
survey on American adults that basically
8:48
found that the most important thing in a
8:50
relationship is faithfulness. The second
8:52
most important thing in a relationship
8:53
is healthy, satisfying sexual activity.
8:57
The third most important thing in a
8:59
relationship is actually sharing
9:01
household chores. This is more important
9:04
than income, more important than looks.
9:06
So all these like social media
9:07
influencers out there who are telling
9:09
you to be an alpha by like making more
9:11
money and getting super sexy and going
9:13
to the gym, that's actually not what the
9:15
data shows. So, I know this sounds
9:17
really insane, but like I want you all
9:19
to think for a second about what you see
9:21
on the internet. How much of what you
9:22
see on the internet is based on actual
9:25
science or research? Very little. What
9:27
determines whether something propagates
9:29
on the internet is the emotional
9:31
engagement it gets, which if you like
9:33
stop and think about it for a second, is
9:35
the very opposite of science. Like, real
9:37
science can be very exciting, but often
9:39
times it involves a lot of methods, a
9:41
lot of data analysis, a lot of really
9:43
drab and dreary stuff. Before you all
9:44
take issue with me telling you to be a
9:46
beta cuck and start to like help your
9:48
wife out with chores, let's take a quick
9:50
look at what the experience of this is
9:52
like from someone. So, this is from a a
9:54
wonderful qualitative research paper. It
9:56
seems the loss of intimacy in the
9:58
non-physical sense is almost universal
10:00
among us and that often leads to the
10:03
physical loss of intimacy as well. It's
10:05
pretty much impossible to feel close
10:07
with a spouse when ADHD problems create
10:10
a wall that blocks the way. For some of
10:12
us, the wall is a control battle for a
10:14
clean, safe place to live. For others,
10:17
it's a fight against our ADHD partners'
10:20
addictions or obsessions, dour,
10:21
financial jeopardy, irritability,
10:23
substance use, thoughtless words or
10:25
deeds, unreliability, or various other
10:27
issues. It doesn't seem to make a heck
10:29
of a lot of difference what specific
10:31
wall is there. A wall defeats intimacy
10:34
every time. Now, what does this mean?
10:36
Practically what's going on is if we
10:37
look at the way in which intimacy forms
10:40
in order to become aroused, we need
10:42
activation of the parasympathetic
10:44
nervous system. The parasympathetic
10:46
nervous system is our rest and
10:47
relaxation kind of system. So often
10:50
times when I'm working with patients who
10:52
have newborns and they kind of have dead
10:53
bedroom and they have young kids, not
10:55
just newborns, but three-year-olds,
10:56
four-year-olds, 5-year-olds,
10:57
7-year-olds, the the rate of sexual
10:59
activity declines. Now, why is that?
11:02
This is really because of the physiology
11:03
of sex. So, we tend to have sex when we
11:06
have a lot of like relaxation. We feel
11:09
pretty good. Like, if you're well
11:10
rested, you're on vacation. If you're
11:12
exhausted, what happens when you get
11:13
into bed? You hit the bed, you don't
11:15
feel like having sex, you kind of pass
11:16
out. Especially if you're a woman. And
11:18
this is where there are some biological
11:19
differences. So, if we sort of think
11:20
about the cost of sex for a man, it's
11:23
like 3 to 8 minutes of pleasure and then
11:25
like tomorrow rolls around, my energy
11:27
level is totally the same. But from a
11:28
biological perspective, what is the cost
11:30
of a sexual act for a woman? It's
11:32
potentially 9 months of pregnancy, a lot
11:34
of energy investment, a lot of child
11:36
rearing investment. So these things are
11:38
viewed somewhat differently on a
11:40
biological level. Now that doesn't mean
11:41
I don't want you guys to interpret this
11:43
like over extrapolate this into like
11:44
women don't like having sex. That's not
11:46
what it is. This is just a broadstrokes
11:48
biological kind of thing. What we do
11:50
know for both genders is that
11:52
parasympathetic activity or relaxation
11:55
is the first step to arousal. Now once
11:57
we start to feel aroused, then our
12:00
sympathetic nervous system kicks in.
12:01
This is the part of our nervous system
12:03
that increases our adrenaline, increases
12:05
blood flow, leads to erections in the
12:07
penis, leads to clitoral engorgment,
12:10
which also happens when women are
12:11
sexually aroused, which if you're
12:12
wondering like why you can't just jump
12:14
to, you know, engaging with the clitoris
12:17
with fingers, mouth, whatever. And why
12:18
women like may be turned off from that,
12:20
it's because actually women need a
12:22
certain amount of clitoral engorgment
12:24
from increased blood flow that comes
12:25
from the parasympathetic nervous system
12:26
to prime those nerves to make it
12:28
actually feel like it's pleasurable. So
12:30
practically what this looks like is, you
12:31
know, when I have patients who have
12:32
ADHD, they're in a high stress state.
12:35
You come home, there's dishes in the
12:36
sink. The trash is overflowing. We've
12:38
got to pay these bills. We got to pick
12:39
up this thing. Your kid needs this kind
12:41
of birthday gift. So there's just so
12:43
much overwhelming work. And by the way,
12:46
96% of people who are in relationships
12:48
with people with ADHD also feel like
12:51
their partner is a burden to them in
12:53
some way. And 92% of people in
12:56
relationships with people with ADHD also
12:58
feel like they have to compensate for
13:01
the lack of organizational contributions
13:04
from their partner. So what this
13:06
practically means is that if your house
13:08
is a mess, if your isn't taken care
13:10
of, you will be in a high stress state.
13:12
Once you're in a high stress state, the
13:14
circuitry that makes you aroused gets
13:17
disabled. And this is why it's crazy,
13:19
but like the most arousing thing you can
13:22
do for your girlfriend or wife is
13:24
actually housework. And there's a
13:26
physiological chain for that. The
13:28
problem is in today's world, everyone's
13:30
like, "Oh yeah, I ain't going to do
13:31
housework. Like, I ain't going to be a
13:32
beta We have these very
13:34
traditional gender roles." And if that's
13:35
the kind of relationship you want and
13:37
your partner sort of wants that, and by
13:38
the way, that relationship also works
13:40
because usually in that classic
13:42
traditional gender relationship, you
13:44
know, the wife or the woman of the
13:46
household has somewhere between 40 and
13:48
60 hours to take care of household work.
13:51
They don't have a job. So hopefully
13:53
that's sufficient. In today's world,
13:55
when we have double inome households,
13:57
women will get absolutely crushed. Now,
13:59
I know a lot of dudes out there will be
14:01
like really upset by what I'm saying
14:02
right now, but this is literally the
14:04
science, right? This is how physiology
14:06
works. This is how sexual arousal works.
14:08
We have survey level data that also
14:10
shows that doing household chores is one
14:12
of the sexiest things that you can do.
14:14
And why is that? Once the stress level
14:16
goes down, we can activate the
14:17
parasympathetic nervous system. Once the
14:19
parasympathetic nervous system kicks in,
14:21
then we will start to feel more aroused.
14:23
We'll have opportunities for connection,
14:25
etc. The last thing that we're going to
Hypersexuality & Hyposexuality
14:27
talk about is ADHD induced
14:28
hypersexuality and hyposexuality.
14:31
Oftentimes people with ADHD experience a
14:34
certain amount of hypersexuality. This
14:36
has been associated with things like
14:37
inattention and impulsivity. So if you
14:40
sort of think about, you know, your
14:41
sexual desires, what are they? They're
14:44
particular impulses. So if I'm not, you
14:46
know, if I'm sort of sitting around and
14:48
I'm like, let's say I'm walking down the
14:49
street and I see someone walk by and I
14:51
start to have like a sexual impulse. Oh
14:52
my god, that person is so hot. man, I
14:54
would like to, you know, XYZ. So, if you
14:56
sort of think about the way that we get
14:58
aroused, sometimes we get aroused
15:00
through sensory stimuli and arousal,
15:03
like I'm sitting here doing my work and
15:04
now I'm feeling frisky. Let me go ahead
15:06
and and approach my partner and try to
15:09
engage in some sexual activity. That's
15:10
basically an impulse. So, a lot of the
15:12
hypersexuality that we see is a function
15:15
of how sensory we are, how susceptible
15:18
to sensory stimuli we are, as well as
15:21
how impulsive we are. The other aspect
15:23
of hypersexuality that we see a lot,
15:24
especially with like compulsive behavior
15:26
and ADHD, is that sex can be used as a
15:29
form of emotional regulation. And
15:31
remember that people with ADHD, their
15:33
negative emotional circuitry is more
15:35
jittery. It experiences negative emotion
15:37
more intensely, more quickly, and for a
15:40
longer period of time. The problem with
15:42
ADHD is that we often times have
15:44
difficulty engaging in alternate
15:46
emotional regulation activities. So if I
15:48
have a neurotypical patient, I tell them
15:50
if you're feeling stressed or anxious,
15:52
meditate. Meditate for 20 to 30 minutes.
15:54
Do this breathing exercise and then
15:56
you'll feel better. Right? That's what
15:58
we'll sort of say. But if you're someone
15:59
who's got ADHD, it can sometimes be hard
16:01
to remember that you should meditate. It
16:04
can be hard to even realize that you're
16:06
feeling anxious. And the ability to
16:09
engage in meditation, which involves
16:11
sitting your ass down in a chair for 20
16:13
to 30 minutes at a time, is really hard
16:15
to do. So often times what I see in my
16:17
patients is that they will default to
16:20
regulating their emotions and managing
16:22
their sex through sexual activity. The
16:24
last thing that we also know is that
16:25
hypersexuality is actually very tightly
16:27
correlated with self-concept and
16:30
self-esteem. The worse your self-concept
16:32
is, the worse your self-esteem is, the
16:34
more likely you are to engage in
16:35
hypersexual behavior. If I don't feel
16:37
content about myself, if I don't feel
16:39
great about myself, one of the best
16:41
things that I can do is engage in sexual
16:43
activity because then I feel connected.
16:45
Then I feel good. I get this rush of
16:47
vasopressin, oxytocin. I feel connected
16:50
to this other human being. I feel seen.
16:52
I can pleasure them in some way, which
16:54
helps me feel really good. And you know,
16:56
if you sort of look at like alpha males
16:58
on the internet, providing sexual
17:00
pleasure with their very very big
17:02
penises is one of the best ways that
17:04
they feel better about themselves,
17:06
right? I've got a big I'm a sexual
17:07
messiah. That makes me a great human
17:10
being. So, there's a lot about
17:11
self-concept and uh sexual activity. The
17:14
last thing to keep in mind is that if
17:16
you grow up with ADHD that is
17:17
undertreated, which is probably the
17:20
case, we see a causal risk between
17:22
growing up with ADHD and being
17:24
depressed. So oftentimes what what I
17:26
sort of think about every time I have a
17:28
patient who comes into my office, if
17:29
they come in and they have a diagnosis
17:31
of ADHD, I assume they have a mood
17:35
disorder like major depressive disorder
17:37
until proven otherwise. Growing up with
17:39
ADHD just means that there's a very high
17:41
risk of developing depression later in
17:44
life. Now, last thing that's very
17:45
bewildering for many people is that not
17:47
only will they be hypersexual, they will
17:49
also be hyposexual. Now why is this? So
17:52
hyposexuality and ADHD has to do with a
17:55
number of different things. The first
17:56
aspect is emotional regulation and the
17:58
jitteriness of our amydala. We talked
18:00
already about stress. So that whole
18:02
mechanism is at play. If you're someone
18:04
who's got ADHD and you have an
18:06
assignment coming up a week from now
18:08
that's due. Your mind is going to be so
18:11
occupied by that, so stressed out about
18:13
that that you can't think about anything
18:15
else. And the really frustrating thing
18:17
is not only can you not think about
18:18
anything else, you can't even do the
18:20
work and be done with it because you
18:22
have to wait until lastm minute panic in
18:24
order to induce your motivational system
18:26
to actually like write that paper or
18:28
study for that exam or whatever. Right?
18:30
So there's a very high stress state that
18:32
we live in that leads to hyposexuality.
18:34
The other mechanism that's important for
18:35
hyposexuality is that usually getting
18:38
aroused involves a chain of events.
18:42
Right? So I start by being relaxed. I
18:44
start by sort of having my
18:45
parasympathetic nervous system active.
18:47
I'm not stressed out. I I'm sort of
18:49
somewhat rested. And then there's some
18:51
amount of touching. There's some amount
18:53
of like maybe I'm like touching you a
18:55
little bit. Maybe you're touching me a
18:56
little bit. Then maybe we're kissing a
18:58
little bit. And then maybe there's some
18:59
heavy petting. And then we sort of have
19:00
this graduated response of like moving
19:03
from A to Z. This is what we sometimes
19:05
call foreplay. When I have patients with
19:07
ADHD, it's crazy. like their partners
19:09
will say like, you know, they don't
19:11
understand that I'm trying to seduce
19:13
them. They're so distractable. Like
19:14
someone else can be like hitting on
19:16
them, rubbing their shoulders, whatever,
19:18
like giving them a kiss, like rubbing
19:20
breasts up against their face and things
19:22
like that. And the person with ADHD is
19:24
like, I'm trying to figure out why Mind
19:26
Sweeper doesn't have a newer version
19:28
that someone has released on Steam. So
19:30
there is basically a chain of attention
19:33
which you have to maintain in order to
19:35
move from initial like sexual overtures
19:38
to the completion of the sexual act. And
19:41
that chain of attention can be sometimes
19:43
very hard to maintain in ADHD which
19:45
leads to a sense of hyposexuality. So in
19:48
my experience as a clinician the more
19:49
that I equip my patients with this kind
19:51
of understanding this isn't necessarily
19:54
like a clinical intervention. This is
19:55
just hey your brain is different and
19:57
that's going to impact every part of
19:59
your life.
