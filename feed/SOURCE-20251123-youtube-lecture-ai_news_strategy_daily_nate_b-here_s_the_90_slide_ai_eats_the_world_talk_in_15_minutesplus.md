## Description (no transcript available)

Benedict Evans gave a memorable 90 slide chat in Singapore this week, and I wanted to pull out the key takeaways here. 

In this video, I dive into the inside scoop on the strategic shifts shaping AI adoption:
• Why Benedict Evans argues AI follows familiar platform cycles
• How large language models become inputs while frontier labs stay differentiated
• What path-dependent adoption means for workflow redesign
• Where AI agents reshape roles, coordination, and org-level leverage

The takeaway: teams that treat AI as optional tooling will lose ground to those redesigning workflows, org charts, and vendor strategy around its inevitability.
