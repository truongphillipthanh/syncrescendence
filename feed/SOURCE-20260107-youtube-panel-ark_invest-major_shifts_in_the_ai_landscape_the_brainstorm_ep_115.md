## Description (no transcript available)

In this episode of The Brainstorm, we discuss the latest developments in AI and technology, including NVIDIA's strategic moves with Groq and Meta's acquisition of Manus AI. We explore the implications of these acquisitions on the AI landscape, the potential for orchestration layers in AI models, and the competitive dynamics among major tech companies. The conversation also touches on the future of user interfaces and the evolving role of voice and text in consumer interactions.

If you know ARK, then you probably know about our long-term research projections, like estimating where we will be 5-10 years from now! But just because we are long-term investors, doesn’t mean we don’t have strong views and opinions on breaking news. In fact, we discuss and debate this every day. So now we’re sharing some of these internal discussions with you in our new video series, “The Brainstorm”, a co-production from ARK and Public.com. Tune in every week as we react to the latest in innovation. Here and there we’ll be joined by special guests, but ultimately this is our chance to join the conversation and share ARK’s quick takes on what’s going on in tech today.
