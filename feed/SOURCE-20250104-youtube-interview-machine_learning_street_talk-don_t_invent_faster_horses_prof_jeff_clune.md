## Description (no transcript available)

AI professor Jeff Clune ruminates on open-ended evolutionary algorithms—systems designed to generate novel and interesting outcomes forever. Drawing inspiration from nature’s boundless creativity, Clune and his collaborators aim to build “Darwin Complete” search spaces, where any computable environment can be simulated. By harnessing the power of large language models and reinforcement learning, these AI agents continuously develop new skills, explore uncharted domains, and even cooperate with one another in complex tasks.

A central theme throughout Clune’s work is “interestingness”: an elusive quality that nudges AI agents toward genuinely original discoveries. Rather than rely on narrowly defined metrics—which often fail due to Goodhart’s Law—Clune employs language models to serve as proxies for human judgment. In doing so, he ensures that “interesting” always reflects authentic novelty, opening the door to unending innovation. 

Yet with these extraordinary possibilities come equally significant risks. Clune says we need AI safety measures—particularly as the technology matures into powerful, open-ended forms. Potential pitfalls include agents inadvertently causing harm or malicious actors subverting AI’s capabilities for destructive ends. To mitigate this, Clune advocates for prudent governance involving democratic coalitions, regulation of cutting-edge models, and global alignment protocols.
