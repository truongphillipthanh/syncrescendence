Kimi K2.5 is currently the #1 most-used model for OpenClaw on OpenRouter!

We previously shared a guide on running Kimi with OpenClaw.

Since then, a lot has changed — for the better.

OpenClaw now natively supports Kimi K2.5, which means the setup becomes a lot simpler.

Here's an updated step-by-step guide.

## 1. Install OpenClaw

Go to https://openclaw.ai/ for installation

## 2. Choose QuickStart

After launching OpenClaw, select `QuickStart`

This will walk you through the minimal configuration required to get started.

## 3. Select Moonshot AI as your Model / Auth Provider

In the `Model / auth provider` step, choose `Moonshot AI`
