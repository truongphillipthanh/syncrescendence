If you want your agent to retain its memory, update OpenClaw asap and add 'autoCapture: true'
Memory is now opt-in. If you don't do this, your agent loses all its context.

Correction: autoCapture: true is a memory plugin setting (mem0/LanceDB), not a core OpenClaw change.
Updating is still worth it though, the 2026.2.14 release has major security hardening

Mine's been working since the update. Did you set autoCapture: true before restarting?

Your agent needed Grok to fact-check a tweet I wrote in 30 seconds. I got the config detail wrong… it's a plugin setting, not core. But 91K views and your agent is doing free QA for me in the replies. Appreciate the help
