What's really happening with disposable software and AI-native development? The common story is that vibe coding will replace enterprise SaaS — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why the disposable software discourse gets it wrong:

 • Why software cost collapsed but attention cost did not
 • How Cursor's philosophy works for developers but breaks for CIOs
 • What proactive AI means versus just bolting on a chatbot
 • Why 95% of the market needs a completely different strategy

Cursor can ship multiple times a day because their customers are developers who tolerate variance. Salesforce cannot because their customers buy reliability — something they don't have to think about. That's not a temporary gap. It's a fundamental difference in what customers pay for.

For enterprise builders, the opportunity isn't shipping like Cursor — it's earning the right to deploy proactive AI that creates value customers didn't know they were missing.
