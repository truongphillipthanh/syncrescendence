## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260208-016-0001
**Lines**: 1-1
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Compound engineering is a system designed to make AI models like Claude Code improve with every use.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260208-016-0002
**Lines**: 5-14
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The Compound Engineering system for Claude Code involves a 4-step process: Plan (sub-agents research codebase and best practices), Work (Claude asks clarifying questions, builds features, writes tests), Assess (review agents check security, architecture, code quality), and Compound (learnings are captured to prevent repeated mistakes).

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260208-016-0003
**Lines**: 50-52
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Users can implement Kieran Klaassen's Compound Engineering system for Claude Code via the 'EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin' available on GitHub.
