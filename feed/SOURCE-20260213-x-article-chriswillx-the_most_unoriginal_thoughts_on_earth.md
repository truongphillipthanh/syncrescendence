# The Most Unoriginal Thoughts on Earth
(Description: A muted blue-grey cinematic image depicting dozens of identical humanoid figures with simple geometric facial features arranged in a crowd formation. Each figure has a smooth, sphere-like head with minimal facial details rendered as dots and lines, creating an effect of uniformity and anonymity. The lighting casts subtle shadows across the smooth surfaces, suggesting a contemplative, somber mood. The composition emphasizes repetition and the loss of individual identity.)
You are not original.
I've talked to thousands of people one-on-one at my live show meet & greets over the last year.
Here is a list of thoughts that almost everyone has, but thinks that no one else has…
- I'm terrified that momentum is more important than talent, and I lost mine.
- I need to choose between partners I fear but am excited by and those I feel safe but bored with.
- My parents did the best they could, and I'm still quietly angry about it.
- Most of what I think I "know" is borrowed confidence.
- I read to feel informed and impress people, not to change.
- I mistake familiarity for truth.
- My opinions align suspiciously well with the people whose approval I want.
- I don't know how to stop striving without disappearing.
- My emotions feel like a personal malfunction, this can't be the way other people experience them.
- I'm calm only because nothing is being truly demanded of me right now.
- I'm more alone than I let on.
- I oscillate between craving safety and craving danger, I am never settled.
- I have set a high standard for myself that others expect from me but I can no longer meet.
- I use productivity to give my life meaning because it has none without it.
- I'm scared my best sexual experiences are already behind me.
- Other people know what they're doing, I'm just pretending.
- I'm afraid this is as good as it gets.
- I don't actually know what I like.
- Wanting more makes me feel ungrateful.
- I'm carrying grief and I don't know how to get rid of it.
- Someone is mad at me. I don't know who or why, but I know someone is mad at me.
- I confuse intensity with meaning.
- I confuse comfort with failure.
- I secretly feel satisfied when other people fail because it makes me feel less behind.
- I'm only valued for what I produce.
- I'm secretly more fragile than I look.
- One wrong decision will permanently ruin everything.
- I should have figured this out by now.
- I peaked earlier than I want to admit.
- If people really knew me, they'd leave.
- I need to become someone else to deserve love.
- Other people are more suited to life than I am.
- I missed the moment when things were meant to click.
- I'm too late to change.
- I'm too early to stop striving.
- There's something fundamentally different about me and it's breaking my life.
- I don't know whether I'm being patient or avoiding my life.
- I'm waiting for permission that isn't coming.
- My sexual desires are shameful and would repel people if revealed.
- I'm afraid I've already made the choices that locked my life in.
- Everyone else can forgive others but me, I'm too petty and when I've lost trust in someone it's impossible for them to get it back no matter how sincerely they apologise.
- I want to be treated like a queen but I'm terrified of losing my independence.
- I want to be treated like a king but I'm terrified of the day I'm not strong enough to lead.
- I'm more sexually shaped by fantasy and accident than I admit.
- I fear becoming my parents more than failing outright.
- I don't know how much of my personality is habit rather than choice.
- I don't know whether my kinks are authentic or adaptive.
- My sense of self collapses slightly when no one is watching.
- I worry I've confused stimulation with intimacy.
- I fear that if history judged me, it would find me cowardly.
- I don't know if my anxiety is intuition or noise.
- Silence scares me.
- I'm terrified that if I truly understood myself, I wouldn't like what I found.
- I'm only a good person when life is going badly.
- I consume ideas the way others consume calories: more than I metabolise.
- I'm more bitter than I admit and I don't know what to do with it.
- I resent people who got what I wanted without paying what I paid.
- I'm waiting for clarity so I don't have to risk being wrong.
- I use preparation as a socially acceptable form of fear.
- I'm angry at people who moved on while I was still thinking.
- I fear that my sense of self is influenced too much by the opinion of others.
- I am scared that if I soften too much, I won't be safe.
- Others love me for my composure, not for who I am underneath it.
- I don't know how everyone built a life while I was still deciding who to be.
- I resent people with families because they look anchored.
- I resent people without families because they look free.
- I feel late to money in a way that compounds quietly every year.
- I'm afraid that if I had kids now, my life would harden permanently.
- I'm afraid that if I don't, it already has.
- I resent younger people for not knowing what's coming.
- I resent older people for surviving it.
- I'm waiting for a version of myself that will never arrive.
- I'm worried that timing matters more than ability or intention.
- I feel like I optimised away the conditions that make some futures possible.
- I didn't realise how many things only work if you start when you're naïve.
- I'm scared that by avoiding the wrong life, I also avoided a real one.
- I believed important choices would feel dramatic, most just stop being available.
- I'm sad that some paths only exist if you walk them early.
…feel less alone this week please (:
