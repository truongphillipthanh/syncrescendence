# The Attention Economy Will Be the Largest Market in a Post Labor Society

## The Opening Observation

In 1971, Nobel Prize winning economist [Herbert A. Simon's observation on information scarcity](https://www.milkenreview.org/articles/the-attention-economy-3-0) quietly predicted the economic structure of the 21st century:

> "In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes… a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention."

Simon wrote this decades before social media, smartphones, generative AI, or algorithmic feeds. Yet his insight now looks less like theory and more like economic prophecy.

Because once intelligence becomes abundant, productivity becomes automated, and goods approach near-zero marginal cost, markets reorganize around the next hard constraint.

That constraint is human attention.

And it may become the most valuable economic resource humanity has ever priced.

## The End of Labor as the Primary Economic Anchor

Artificial intelligence is not just another productivity tool. It represents a structural shift in how economies produce value.

Economic modeling already suggests that integrating advanced AI into production could disrupt wage structures, income distribution, and the traditional labor-based economy, potentially requiring a renegotiation of the social contract.

Meanwhile, empirical research indicates that 40 to 70 percent of tasks across sectors could be automated, with digital labor operating nearly continuously at a fraction of human cost.

When production scales without proportional human effort, labor stops being the dominant bottleneck.

But economies cannot function without scarcity.

So scarcity moves.

For the first time in modern history, the limiting factor is not what we can produce.

It is what we can notice.

## Scarcity Has Migrated From Information to Cognition

For centuries, information itself was scarce. Books were rare. Data was expensive. Expertise was gated.

Now the relationship has inverted.

Simon recognized this reversal early: abundance of information necessarily creates scarcity of attention.

Today, that abundance is effectively infinite.

AI can generate articles, videos, music, code, simulations, entire virtual worlds. Distribution is frictionless. Creation is cheap.

Human cognition is neither.

Attention is biologically constrained. Every person has a finite number of waking hours and limited cognitive bandwidth. When attention is directed toward one stimulus, others necessarily disappear from awareness.

This makes attention structurally scarce in a way that compute, energy, and even capital are not.

And structural scarcity is where markets form.

## Attention Is Already Becoming a Tradable Asset

Economists increasingly describe attention as "a scarce and highly valuable resource, rivalrous, tradable, and increasingly subject to market dynamics."

That language matters.

Rivalrous resources behave like commodities. If one actor captures them, others cannot.

Your attention cannot be duplicated.

Only allocated.

This is why modern platforms compete not merely for users, but for minutes, gaze duration, and cognitive engagement.

We are watching the early infrastructure of attention markets being built in real time.

## Why the Attention Economy Will Eclipse Traditional Markets

### 1. Automation Creates Hyperabundance

When production constraints disappear, differentiation shifts from creation to discovery.

The economic question stops being:

"Who can make this?"

and becomes:

"Who gets seen?"

Algorithmic distribution increasingly determines economic winners, because visibility precedes monetization.

Distribution becomes the new production.

### 2. Labor Income Shrinks Relative to Capital and Systems

Research on automation shows that AGI driven capital accumulation may reduce labor's share of output and force major policy adjustments to maintain stability.

Historically, wages powered consumption.

In a post labor economy, demand will depend less on employment and more on access, transfers, ownership structures, or machine generated productivity.

But regardless of income mechanics, one variable remains fixed:

Human attention.

Even a fully automated economy cannot scale beyond the number of conscious moments available to experience it.

### 3. Markets Follow the Hard Constraint

Oil drove geopolitics because it was scarce.

Semiconductors drive geopolitics because they are scarce.

In the intelligence age, attention becomes the ultimate bottleneck.

Simon's framework implies a deep economic law:

When a resource becomes scarce relative to supply, allocation mechanisms evolve around it.

That is the birth of a market.

### 4. Attention Has Massive Externalities

Some economists now argue that attention behaves like a shared societal resource threatened by over exploitation, producing harms such as reduced agency, health impacts, and political distortion when engagement is excessively engineered.

This is classic market failure territory.

Whenever externalities emerge, regulation follows.

Expect future policy debates not just about data ownership or AI safety, but about cognitive sovereignty.

Who controls the human attentional environment may become one of the defining governance questions of the century.

## The Political Economy of Attention

Control over attention is not merely commercial power.

It is narrative power.

It shapes:

- cultural values
- technological adoption
- electoral outcomes
- social norms
- perceived reality

Simon predicted a reversal in the relationship between producers and consumers once information flooded the system.

We are now living inside that reversal.

The central economic struggle is no longer production capacity.

It is perceptual influence.

## The Great Status Shift: From Wealth to Focus

Industrial wealth signaled freedom from physical labor.

In the attention age, the ultimate luxury may be freedom from cognitive intrusion.

Imagine a future status hierarchy defined not by what you own, but by what you can ignore.

The truly powerful may not be those who command the most attention.

But those who control their own.

## Risk: Engineered Distraction at Planetary Scale

If attention becomes the dominant economic prize, optimization pressure will intensify.

Systems will learn, with increasing precision, how to capture and retain human focus.

Without guardrails, this creates a troubling equilibrium:

Machines maximize engagement.

Humans drift toward passive consumption.

The resulting loss of agency is exactly why some researchers propose policy tools such as taxes on attention capture to internalize social costs.

It is a striking idea.

Tax pollution.

Tax carbon.

Perhaps someday, tax distraction.

## Opportunity: The Cognitive Renaissance

Yet the attention economy is not inherently dystopian.

If machines absorb survival labor, humanity may redirect energy toward exploration, creativity, relationships, philosophy, and scientific discovery.

History suggests that as societies grow wealthier, consumption shifts toward culture and experience.

A post labor civilization could universalize that trajectory.

The scarce resource would no longer be food, shelter, or manufactured goods.

It would be meaning.

And meaning is transmitted through attention.

## The Defining Economic Transition

The agricultural era valued land.

The industrial era valued capital.

The digital era valued information.

The post labor era will value attention.

Because when intelligence is abundant and creation is effortless, one question quietly governs the entire economy:

What is worth noticing?

The actors who answer that question will not just build the largest companies.

They will shape civilization's direction.
