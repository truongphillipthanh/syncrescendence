In this video, I put Clawdbot head-to-head against Claude Code to see which AI coding tool actually 
delivers. 

I break down everything you need to know across the metrics that actually matter: ability, setup, risk, cost, security, usability, ROI, and raw power. 

The verdict? Claude Code still comes out on top, but Clawdbot is a super young tool has some interesting strengths if you know what you're doing. That said, you need to be careful with Clawdbot unless you really understand the risks involved. 

Whether you're considering making the switch or just want to understand what these tools can actually do, this video will give you the full picture.
