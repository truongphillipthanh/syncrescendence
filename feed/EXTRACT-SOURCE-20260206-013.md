## Analogy (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-013-0006
**Lines**: 27-34
**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The historical progression from villages to city-states, then to nations, and finally to a world economy demonstrates that increasing population sizes (from thousands to billions) have consistently led to full employment and higher standards of living, suggesting a similar outcome when adding billions of AI agents and robots.
