Welcome to the first annual Limitless AI Awards show where we're ranking the biggest Winners and Losers in AI. You’re either getting the crown… or the dunce cap. 🏆🧢

2025 was pure AI chaos: surprise rookies, biggest flops, unhinged drama, and one hidden “Model of the Year” pick that might start a war in the group chat.

We go category-by-category: Rookie of the Year, Biggest Flop, Moat Builder, Model Most Likely to Make You Rich, Model of the Year, Biggest Loser, and AI Company of the Year, and we didn’t pre-align on answers… so the reveals are real. Drop your winners/losers in the comments and tell us what we got wrong (we can take it).
