> To implement the system: set up Notion databases (Knowledge Base, Learning Sessions), connect Claude Code to Notion, pick a specific domain for work, run a 30-minute learning session using the framework prompt, generate and review a daily newsletter, ask all questions through the system, and consistently run the newsletter daily.
