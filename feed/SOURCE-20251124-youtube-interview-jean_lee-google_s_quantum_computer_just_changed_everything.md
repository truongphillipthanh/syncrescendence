## Description (no transcript available)

Google just announced the first verifiable quantum advantage on its new quantum computer chip, Willow, and this quantum computing breakthrough is much bigger than most people realize. Let's break down Google’s quantum announcement in simple terms and explain what actually happened in quantum computing, why scientists are calling this update historic, and how it could reshape AI, medicine, and the entire future of quantum computing.

We’ll look at how the Willow chip solved a physics problem 13,000 times faster than a supercomputer, why “verifiable quantum advantage” is the most important word in the entire announcement, how the quantum computing technique (quantum echoes) works, and what this means for studying molecules, designing new drugs, decoding protein structures, and the future of AI.

Most people think quantum computing is decades away. It’s not. Google says industry applications for quantum computing are just a few years away. We can soon do what can’t be done on classical super computers. I’ll show you how quantum computing and artificial intelligence are now feeding into each other, why this quantum computing update will accelerate breakthroughs in AI and science even faster, and what the next leap in quantum hardware means for the rest of us.

If you want to understand what just changed in the quantum world, and why researchers are genuinely excited, this video will walk you through the entire quantum story.

⭐️About me 
========================
I’m Jean—an ex-WhatsApp early engineer and Meta manager with over 20 years in tech. I was an early engineer at WhatsApp before its $19B acquisition by Meta, then led engineering teams at Meta, where I experienced firsthand how technology evolves and shapes the world.
Now, I’m on a mission to break down how AI is changing our careers, industries, and the future of work. AI will transform how we work, learn, and live, and many are overwhelmed by what this means—especially those without access or context.
No hype. No jargon. Just real-world insights for navigating AI and what’s next.
