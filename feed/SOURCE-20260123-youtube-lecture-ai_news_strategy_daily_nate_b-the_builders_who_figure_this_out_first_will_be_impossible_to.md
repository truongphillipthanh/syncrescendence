What's really happening with AI productivity in 2026? The common story is that better prompting is the answer — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why the bottleneck has shifted from capability to cognitive architecture:

 • Why adopting an engineering manager mindset changes everything
 • How killing the contribution badge unlocks real velocity
 • What strategic deep diving looks like across technical and non-technical work
 • Why experience cannot be compressed at the speed you can build

We solved the wrong problem. For two years we optimized for prompting and tool selection. Those remain foundational — but they're no longer sufficient. The people who distinguish themselves now have the same toolset as everyone else. What separates them is systems thinking and the ability to move fluidly between altitudes of abstraction.

For builders at every level, the forcing function is here — but partnership with AI requires knowing what actually matters about what you're building.
