## Description (no transcript available)

New research from Berkeley Haas and the Harvard Business Review finds AI power users facing increased work through task expansion, blurred boundaries, and parallel multitasking. Generative agents boost capability and output while creating spillover review work, accelerated speed expectations, and higher risk of constant partial attention and burnout. Suggested management strategies include intentional pauses, sequencing, and human grounding, and organizations treating AI as an expansionary opportunity rather than a mere efficiency tool can unlock new products and revenue.
