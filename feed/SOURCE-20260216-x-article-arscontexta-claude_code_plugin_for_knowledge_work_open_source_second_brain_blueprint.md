# Claude Code Plugin for Knowledge Work (Open Source Second Brain Blueprint)
(Description: Hero image showing "ARS CONTEXTA" in large pixelated white text on dark background)
## Overview
A month ago I wrote about building Claude a second brain. Today you can create your own.
## What is a Second Brain?
A second brain is a way of structuring information so you can actually retrieve it, group it and build on top of it.
Humans have been figuring out how to think better with external systems for centuries.
## The Problem
Agents need the same thing and nobody built it for them.
Your agent needs a way to remember what it learned, find connections between ideas and build on previous work instead of starting from zero every session.
## The Solution: arscontexta
**arscontexta** is a Claude code plugin that does exactly that.
It takes what humans figured out about building thinking systems and generates a complete memory architecture in your project folder, grounded in actual research about how knowledge systems work.
You install it, run `/setup` and have a conversation about what you need. A few messages later you have a working knowledge system on your machine built from first principles that is not copied from a template.
(Might be a bit token hungry but you get a MASSIVE individualized baseline structure)
## Why Not Templates?
Think about how many Notion templates exist (>30k). People build them for everything like project tracking, habit tracking, CRM, reading lists or journaling.
Thousands of templates because everyone organizes differently and everyone needs something slightly different.
**arscontexta** is like the engine behind that but for your agent's second brain.
It doesn't give you one template to fill in, it generates an individualized knowledge system that fits how you actually think and grows with you naturally as your needs change.
## The Methodology
Behind that conversation sits a methodology graph of interconnected research claims about how knowledge systems work, and the engine reasons through all of it to figure out what your system should look like.
Except everything lives on your computer as markdown files with wiki links and yaml. You can uninstall the plugin and the system keeps working because it's just files you own.
## Core Philosophy
That's the part I keep coming back to:
**Your memory should be yours**
arscontexta is just instructions, a tool that helps you build and own your memory yourself.
**Open source, free, local-first**

## Disclaimer
Wanted to release my workflow for a while now but the internal version is completely cluttered with personal projects and I can't just ship that.
So I've been using the system itself to derive a clean version from the methodology.
Figured you could help with testing. If something breaks or feels off, I'm happy about any kind of feedback right now.
