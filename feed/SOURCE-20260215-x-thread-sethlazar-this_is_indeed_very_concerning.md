This is indeed very concerning, and illustrates very profoundly the double edged sword of AI agents. On the one hand, they provide what we called **"default bottom up interoperability"**, because you can use them to log in across services, hop over walled gardens, aggregate content and data etc. This is incredibly useful for reducing platform control (i have my agents checking all the feeds i'm interested in, and sending me summaries, which means I spend less time on each platform than i otherwise would; this can go across the board).
But on the other hand, all of those garden walls helped provide a measure of security and encryption that is now being not just eroded but completely wiped out. Having e2ee messages read by a bot takes your previously private messages and passes them through as plain text to some model somewhere—in this case one run by, at the very least, folks with divided loyalties.
In our paper we talked about the dichotomy of platform agents and agent advocates. We *didn't* think of, but *should have* cos in hindsight it's obvious, the possibility of there being state agents as well. Your perfect universal intermediary, mediating every digital interaction, and just keeping an eye on you for the sake of the CCP.
Enabling genuinely secure, private inference should be an urgent priority. And I think probably Chinese-hosted AI agents should just be a non-starter. Rather nip it in the bud now than allow another tiktok situation to arise (people were up in arms about the whole tiktok thing and that was just one little corner of their digital life; if everyone's using free double agents based in China, they'll be even more dependent on them)

Moonshot AI's announcement that it will offer to host AI agents developed through OpenClaw—continuously, for anyone in the world—should be ringing massive, MASSIVE alarm bells in Washington.
