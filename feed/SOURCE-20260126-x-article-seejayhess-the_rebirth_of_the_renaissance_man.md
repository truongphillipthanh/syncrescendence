## The Oscillation

Think about the difference between your great-great-grandfather and your grandfather. Your great-great-grandfather was probably a farmer, but that meant he was also a carpenter, a veterinarian, a weatherman, a mechanic, and a dozen other things depending on what the day required. If something broke, he fixed it. If something needed building, he built it. Specialization was a luxury he couldn't afford because survival demanded that he be competent at everything.

Your grandfather, or maybe your father, was different. He probably had a trade or a profession. He spent decades becoming one of the best at that specific thing, and the economy rewarded him for it. That knowledge took years to accumulate, and it made him valuable in a way that couldn't be easily replaced.

We've been oscillating between these two archetypes for as long as humans have been humans. The caveman was a generalist out of necessity, solving whatever problems showed up that day to keep his family alive. Then we figured out agriculture and started settling down, and suddenly it made sense for some people to focus entirely on making pots while others focused on raising animals. The Renaissance man emerged when knowledge became portable enough that a single curious mind could synthesize painting with anatomy with engineering with philosophy. And then the industrial revolution came along and demanded we narrow ourselves back down again, because the factory didn't need da Vincis, it needed people who could do one thing exceptionally well, repeatedly, forever.

I've been thinking a lot lately about where we are in that cycle, and I think the wheel is spinning again.

## The Mourning Period

I've come to believe that AI is killing the factory. Not the physical buildings with assembly lines, but the entire economic logic that made specialization the winning strategy for the past two hundred years.

Personally, I spent years of my life grinding to understand the nuanced pieces of software engineering that I simply don't need to know anymore and I was proud of that knowledge. It felt like the thing that made me good at my job. And now I'm watching it become...optional? Irrelevant? I still don't know how I feel about it or what it means for me. It's a weird loss of identity that I'm actively grappling with.

So when I talk about the person who spent four years studying basic economics to become a first-year analyst, or the person who mastered Excel formulas as their career moat, or the person who defined their professional identity by narrow expertise in one particular domain, I'm talking about myself too. These people are watching the ground shift beneath them, and I think we should be honest about that. When you've built your identity around being the person who knows some specific thing better than anyone else, and suddenly a machine can do that specific thing passably well for almost free, struggling to process is normal. I know I am.

But acknowledgment isn't permission for stagnation.

The safe harbors from automation are shrinking, but they're not gone. Human-to-human interaction will persist because we actually want the human, not just the service. Teachers, therapists, coaches, the value they provide isn't really about the information they transfer, it's about the attention and connection with another person. AI can replicate the content of what a therapist says, but that misses the entire point of therapy. These jobs will transform, the tools will change, but the core value won't degrade because it was never about the deliverable in the first place.

Pretty much everything else, though, is on the table.

## The Generalist's Superpower

So what survives in a world where narrow expertise is getting automated away? The answer, I think, is synthesis. Knowing a lot about a lot is becoming table stakes since anyone can pull up information on any topic in seconds. But knowing how things connect, understanding why a shift in monetary policy affects housing development affects traffic patterns affects remote work culture, that kind of cross-domain pattern recognition is the thing AI struggles with because it requires a sort of contextual judgment that emerges from actually living in the world and caring about outcomes.

The generalist sees patterns the specialist can't because the specialist has been staring at one tree for so long they didn't notice the forest catching fire. I know that sounds harsh, but I think it's true. The ability to zoom out, to see how different systems interact, to synthesize insights from multiple domains into something coherent, that's what the polymath always had, and it's exactly what's becoming valuable again.

I think about this in terms of my own work as a software engineer. I'm fundamentally an orchestrator of AI agents now. I need to understand context engineering and how to build complex systems and how to articulate ideas with enough clarity that a machine can execute them. The actual coding part is increasingly handled by agents, and unlike human reports, agents don't politic, don't need motivation, and don't take vacation. My job is to maintain high-level output and make sure the pieces fit together in a way that makes sense. We keep moving up the stack, but we never move infinitely up. There will always need to be drivers and orchestrators, and if you're not positioning yourself to be one of those people, you're positioning yourself to be what gets orchestrated.

## We Are Forgetting

Unfortunately, I feel this myself. We're already forgetting how to build things. Think about the AWS outages over the past year and the iBeer meme that's been floating around, where people joke "we don't know how to make this anymore." That's not entirely a joke. As we delegate more to AI, specialist knowledge doesn't transfer to the next generation because there's no next generation learning those skills. It evaporates.

To quote Michael Irvin, "we're losing recipes!" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAdRX76_Udo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAdRX76_Udo)

The generalist with AI power tools could easily become the dilettante with power tools, confidently mediocre at everything and deeply competent at nothing. The line between polymath and bullshitter gets thin when everyone has access to the same capabilities.

And there's a darker version of this that keeps me up at night. Most people hate their managers, and there's a reason for that. The manager is often the person who was best at politics, not the person who was best at the actual work. If the AI age creates a world of orchestrators and orchestrated, are we building a world of AI-powered politicians who can sound smart about anything but don't actually know how any of it works? I don't know the answer, but it's worth asking.

The orchestrators and the orchestrated have always existed, that's not new. But the orchestrated used to be needed. Someone had to do the work. Now that work is increasingly being done by machines, and I think we should be clear about what that means for the people who optimized their entire lives for doing that work well.

## A Broken Pipeline

This brings me to the broken pipeline of education. Pick a major, specialize, get credentials. This playbook was designed for a world of specialists. It sorted humans into buckets and gave them permission slips to operate in narrow domains, and that made sense when narrow domains were where the value lived. Now the value lives in synthesis, in connection, in orchestration, and the 22-year-old following the old playbook is running the wrong race.

What replaces it? I genuinely don't know yet. Maybe it's self-directed learning, maybe it's apprenticeships, maybe it's something we haven't invented. But I'm fairly certain the four-year degree as the default path to career success is going away, and the people who figure that out earlier will have a significant advantage.

## The Advice

If I had to give advice, and I recognize the arrogance of anyone giving advice about a future nobody fully understands, it would be this: read widely and understand how things connect rather than just how they work. Be online, particularly on X, (but don't get sucked into a slop timeline) and know what's moving in the world because the pace of change is too fast to ignore for four years while you're in school. Don't specialize too early since your major matters less than your ability to see across boundaries.

And if you're the 45-year-old specialist reading this, the same advice applies, but it's harder because you have to let your old identity die first. If you tie your ego to the specialization you mastered, you will be replaced and your ego will die with it. Better to kill it yourself, deliberately, and rebuild what you think is valuable from first principles.

I feel years ahead of the general population on this. The tooling for AI was built around writing code first since software has been both the best medium for AI agents and the most economically viable application we've seen. But this will extend to other professions. All of them, probably. What's happening to software engineering right now is coming for everyone else, and the question isn't whether it will happen, it's how fast.

## The Return

The Renaissance Man died when the factory demanded specialists. AI is killing the factory. The Renaissance Man is coming back. Become a Renaissance Man.
