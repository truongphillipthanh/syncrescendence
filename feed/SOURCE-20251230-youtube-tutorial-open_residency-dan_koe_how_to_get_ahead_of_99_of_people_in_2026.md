In this episode, we sit down with Dan Koe for a deep conversation about building a Future Proof Skill Stack, navigating AI, and designing a life that isn’t dictated by someone else’s goals. Dan breaks down why the most important skills today aren’t technical, but meta — learning how to learn, how to think, and how to earn — and why generalists who set their own direction consistently outperform specialists trained to fit into predefined roles.

We explore how AI is accelerating the need for adaptability, why taste, narrative, and trust are becoming the real moats, and how creators can stop chasing niches and instead become the niche. Dan shares his systems for learning faster, writing better, building trust online, prompting AI effectively, and scaling from a one-person business into larger ventures — plus why clarity comes from action, not overthinking.
