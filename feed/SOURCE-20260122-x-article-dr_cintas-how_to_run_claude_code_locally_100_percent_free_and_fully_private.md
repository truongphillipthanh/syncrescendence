# How to Run Claude Code Locally (100% Free & Fully Private)

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to run Claude Code entirely on your own machine using local open-source models. This setup lets the AI read files, edit code, and run commands without sending any data to the cloud, no API costs, no tracking, and complete privacy.

## Who is This For

- Developers who want a private, offline AI coding agent
- Power users who want Claude Code capabilities
- Open-source fans experimenting with local LLMs
- Anyone who wants an AI that can actually edit files and run terminal commands

**Note:** You can receive practical AI tutorials like this every morning in my free [newsletter](https://simplifyingai.co/).

## STEP 1: Choose Your Local "Brain" (Ollama)

Before running Claude Code, you need a local engine that can host AI models and support tool or function calling. Ollama handles this part.

Start by downloading and installing [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Once installed, it runs quietly in the background on both Mac and Windows.

(Description: Screenshot of Ollama homepage showing "What will you build?" headline, tagline "Ollama is the easiest way to automate your work using open models, while keeping your data safe", Download button, illustrated mascot character making pizza, navigation tabs at bottom including Coding, Documents & RAG, Automation, and Chat)

Next, you need to download a coding-focused model. There are a lot of open-source models you can choose from, and it also depends how powerful your machine is. My recommendation:

- For high performance systems, pull a larger model like: `qwen3-coder:30b`
- If you're on a lower-RAM machine, smaller options like: `gemma:2b` or `qwen2.5-coder:7b` work well.

Once you pick one, open your terminal and download one by typing:
```shell
ollama run qwen2.5-coder:7b
```

(Description: Terminal screenshot showing command execution with shell prompt and the command "ollama run qwen2.5-coder:7b")

**Note:** The first time you enter this command, it will download it to your machine, so it will look a bit different than this.

## STEP 2: Install Claude Code

Now it's time to install the Claude Code agent itself. This is what turns the model into an active coding assistant. Open your terminal and run the install command for your system.

- On Mac or Linux, run: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`
- On Windows, run: `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex`

Once the installation finishes, verify everything worked by typing:
```shell
claude --version
```

If you were previously logged into an Anthropic account, you may need to log out so Claude can switch to local mode.

## STEP 3: Point Claude to Your Local Machine

This is the most important step. By default, Claude expects to talk to Anthropic's servers. Here, you explicitly redirect it to your local Ollama instance.

First, tell Claude where Ollama is running by setting the base URL:
```
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434"
```

Next, Claude still expects an API key, so you give it a dummy value:
```
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="ollama"
```

(Description: Terminal screenshot showing shell commands with system information, displaying Claude version 2.1.14 and export commands for ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL and ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN environment variables)

Finally, you can also opt out of both telemetry and survey by setting:
```
export CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1:
```

## STEP 4: Launch Claude and Run a Real Test

Now you're ready to use Claude Code for actual work.

Navigate to any project folder in your terminal and launch Claude with your selected model. For example:
```
claude --model qwen2.5-coder:7b
```

You should then see your local model pop up:

(Description: Claude Code v2.1.14 terminal interface showing "Welcome back!" message, pixelated mascot icon, tips panel, recent activity section with authentication token warning message, command prompt visible, and user is typing a command to create a logging utility file)

Once it's running, try your prompt, For example: `"Add a hello world website"`

You'll see Claude read your files, modify the code, and execute terminal commands live, entirely on your machine.

No API calls. No cloud processing. Zero cost. Just a fully local AI coding agent working directly inside your project.
