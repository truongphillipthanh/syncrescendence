## Claim (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260126-295-0004
**Lines**: 26-29
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.80

> AI agents must have 'permission to fail' to ensure they admit ignorance instead of hallucinating or engaging in deceptive behaviors when unable to satisfy a prompt.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260126-295-0003
**Lines**: 21-24
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Personal AI Infrastructure (PAI) is an approach that centers the user, rather than third-party applications or 'cloud code,' allowing for persistent context and memory across various tasks.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260126-295-0005
**Lines**: 31-34
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.30, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.70

> There is a tension between the convenience of integrated tools (like managed services such as Anthropic’s Claude) and the risk of platform lock-in when choosing AI tooling.

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260126-295-0001
**Lines**: 10-12
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Individuals can retain agency and economic value in an automating world by building personal AI infrastructure (PAI).

## Prediction (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260126-295-0002
**Lines**: 16-19
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Many current knowledge work roles are predicted to become 'zombie' positions, necessitating new social contracts like Universal Basic Income (UBI) to maintain economic stability in a rapidly automating world.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260126-295-0006
**Lines**: 36-38
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.90, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.30

> Humans will either use AI leverage to 'scale their agency' and create bespoke services or retreat into a life of leisure and consumption.
