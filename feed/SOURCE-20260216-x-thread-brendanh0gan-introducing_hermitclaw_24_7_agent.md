# Introducing HermitClaw - A 24/7 Agent
**Brendan Hogan** @brendanh0gan
introducing HermitClaw - a 24/7 Agent that lives (and can only access) a single folder on your desktop
HermitClaw follows its own research curiosities, surfs the web, writes code - and will play with any file you drop in its folder
all code and details below!

(Description: Embedded video demonstration showing HermitClaw interface. The video presents a split-screen layout:
**Left side**: A game-like isometric environment with a yellow/beige tileset featuring a character sprite and various interactive elements, demonstrating the agent's operating environment.
**Right side - Code Editor and Terminal Output**:
```
$ echo '# Projects Tracker'
## Current Projects
- None yet!
## Ideas & Starts
- Research networks in nature: weaving, wind, mycelium?
[Use this file to add, update, and track real project progress!]
> projects.md
$ mkdir notes research_projects
[No output]
```
The video also displays a "Projects Tracker" command output and shows the HermitClaw agent interacting with its folder structure, creating files, and tracking research projects. Terminal commands visible include file system operations and project management tasks. The demonstration shows how the agent autonomously manages its research curiosities and maintains project documentation within its designated folder.
