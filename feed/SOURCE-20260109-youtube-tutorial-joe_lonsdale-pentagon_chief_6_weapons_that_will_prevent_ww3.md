## Description (no transcript available)

Emil Michael directs the U.S. military's research and development of advanced technologies. Previously, he led global business growth for Uber — one of the fastest moving organizations in Silicon Valley history. Can he bring that startup speed to the Department of War? What are the six critical areas of innovation he's prioritizing? And how is he investing in these key technologies to bolster the defense industrial base? 

We're honored to go inside the Pentagon for a special episode with Emil Michael, Chief Technology Officer and Under Secretary of War for Research & Engineering. He oversees the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Office of Strategic Capital, and other critical organizations. Prior, he helped scale multiple businesses, including D-Wave Systems, Tellme Networks, and Uber Technologies. Earlier in his career, he also served as a White House Fellow and later on the Defense Business Board.

We begin with Emil's decision to join the Trump administration, and why he believes this is a generational opportunity to transform the culture and pace of innovation inside the Pentagon. Learn how he rolled out GenAI.mil (Google's Gemini) to the entire force — roughly three million people — in a matter of months. Next, we dive into his decision to pare down the all-important Critical Technologies List, which drives the Pentagon's R&D spending, from 14 areas to six. Then, we discuss the Department's shift to a "commercial first" approach and what that means for the defense industrial base. Finally, we cover his priorities for the Office of Strategic Capital, plus how he's thinking about talent and encouraging our best and brightest to step up and serve the country.
