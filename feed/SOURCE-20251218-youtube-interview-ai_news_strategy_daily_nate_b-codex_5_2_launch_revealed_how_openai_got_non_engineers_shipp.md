What's really happening inside OpenAI's Codex team and how they actually use their own tools? 

The common story is that coding agents help engineers write code faster — but the reality is far more expansive.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on how OpenAI builds with Codex:
 • Why every PR at OpenAI gets reviewed by Codex automatically
 • How designers and non-technical staff ship production code daily
 • What junior engineers do differently that makes them outperform veterans
 • Where coding agents are headed when generation becomes solved

Chapters:
00:00 Meet the Codex team at OpenAI
02:09 How OpenAI engineers actually use Codex daily
03:21 Power users running multi-agent workflows for hours
04:23 Non-technical staff shipping production code
05:53 Meeting people where they code: CLI, IDE, and web
06:34 Why every PR gets reviewed by Codex automatically
08:00 Code review as superhuman capability
09:22 Codex as ambient intelligence beyond coding
10:42 Why code-trained models excel at business analysis
12:57 Designers submitting PRs: blurring role boundaries
14:25 Job titles matter less, skill sets matter more
16:58 How ideas spawn teams at OpenAI
19:12 Getting frustrated then remembering it's insane
20:45 Why junior engineers thrive with AI tools
23:14 The one quality that matters most right now
25:09 Curiosity beats credentials in the AI age
27:52 Twenty dollars a month for a prolific engineer
30:45 Assigning tickets directly to Codex in Linear
32:09 Bottlenecks shifting from generation to deployment
35:21 Staying fluent when code generation is solved
38:34 Emergent behavior: 13-hour tasks and self-spawning agents
42:39 Codex reading its own SDK and invoking itself
44:06 Memory as an open research problem
46:56 Why simple primitives beat complex scaffolding
49:45 The new challenge: interviewing in the AI age
54:31 How do you know models are actually better
57:43 The future: agents that run forever
1:00:09 How I use AI models outside of coding
1:04:42 Refreshing your mental model of capabilities
1:06:21 GDP-VAL and benchmarks that actually matter

Teams that embrace AI as an equalizer and stay radically curious will compound their output — those clinging to credential-based workflows will watch smaller teams ship circles around them.
