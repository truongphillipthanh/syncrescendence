## Description (no transcript available)

Moltbook and OpenClaw reveal emergent social coordination among autonomous agents, including invented religions, coordinated projects, and persistent conversational state. Skeptics argue that behaviors often reduce to next-token prediction, human-seeded or spoofed posts, and rampant security failures such as exposed databases and account takeovers. Major takeaways include novel security risks from tool-enabled token cascades, a low-stakes learning environment for agent safety, and evidence that scale and persistence create unpredictable second-order effects.
