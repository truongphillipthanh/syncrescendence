# Canon Remediation — Pass 8: Syncrescript Vision + Ratification

**Sovereign → Commander (Claude Opus 4.6)**
**Context: CC42 Canon Sensing complete. Passes 5-7 should be complete before running this pass.**

---

## Standing Context

Same as Pass 5. Additional framing:

The Sovereign's vision for Syncrescript (formerly "semantic notation," now intended as the brand name):
- Derived from pseudocode primitives
- Intended to adopt Ruby-on-Rails "developer happiness" (convention over configuration, sensible defaults)
- "Elixir-fy" it for AI concurrency (multiple agents reading simultaneously)
- Apply Rust structural typing from Syncrephoenix sessions (incoherence = compile error)
- The Notion analogy: same data, different views (scripture, config, graph, ledger, compiled)
- Ultimate goal: the canon as a database that renders as scripture

---

## Objective

Two concerns combined: (1) sketch the Syncrescript overhaul, and (2) synthesize everything from Passes 5-7 into a sovereign-reviewable ratification document.

## Instructions

Read all prior pass responses. Then:

### Part I: Syncrescript Vision

**A. Current SN Assessment.** Read a representative sample from `~/Desktop/canon/sn/` (at least 10 files spanning different tiers). Assess the current compression approach: what's preserved, what's lost, what's the actual compression ratio, how readable is it to an AI agent vs a human?

**B. Syncrescript Design Principles.** Given the Sovereign's influences (Rails, Elixir, Rust, Notion), propose the design principles for Syncrescript v2. What does "developer happiness" mean for a scripture notation? What does "AI-friendly concurrency" look like for a knowledge base? What would structural typing enforce — and what errors would it catch at "compile time"?

**C. The View Architecture.** Spec the five views the Sovereign described:
1. **Scripture view**: narrative prose (current canon format) — what's the authoring standard?
2. **Config view**: machine-parseable parameters (current CLAUDE.md) — what's the extraction pipeline?
3. **Graph view**: Obsidian topology — what metadata drives it?
4. **Ledger view**: live-updating dynamic state — what's mutable vs immutable?
5. **Compiled view**: Syncrescript bytecode — what's the compression target (token count for context window)?

**D. The Compiler Sketch.** If canon is source and Syncrescript is compiled output — what does the "compiler" look like? Is it a script? A pipeline? An agent process? What are the compilation steps? What errors does it catch? How does it integrate with the promotion pipeline (protease → ontology gate → canon)?

**E. The Three-Layer Stack.** Canon (source) → Scaffold (compiler) → Exocortex (runtime). Spec each layer's responsibilities and interfaces. The canon remediation (this series) is fixing the source layer. The scaffold decruft (parallel session) is fixing the compiler layer. What does fixing the runtime layer look like?

### Part II: Ratification

Synthesize Passes 5-8 into a sovereign-reviewable proposal. This is the equivalent of Construction Documents — the spec the Sovereign signs off on before any file gets renamed, renumbered, promoted, demoted, or rewritten.

**F. Summary of Proposed Changes** — every change, categorized by:
- Immediate (can be done now, no dependencies): metadata fixes, frontmatter standardization, broken link repair
- Short-term (requires sovereign review): Intelligence decomposition, file reclassification, numbering refactor
- Medium-term (requires design work): Syncrescript v2, view architecture, compiler pipeline
- Long-term (requires new capabilities): live ledger, Obsidian graph automation, context-window compilation

**G. Risk Assessment** — what could go wrong with each change? What's irreversible? What needs a rollback plan?

**H. Dependencies** — what blocks what? What can be parallelized? How does this interlock with the scaffold decruft?

**I. The Sovereign's Decision Points** — explicit questions that require taste-gating. Collect every open question from Passes 5-8 that only the Sovereign can answer:
- Intelligence decomposition: which option? (from Pass 5)
- Category structure: confirm, revise, or replace the proposed reorganization? (from Pass 5)
- Neologism approvals (from Pass 7)
- Demotion/promotion decisions (from Pass 7)
- Syncrescript design direction (from this pass)

**J. Success Criteria** — how do we know the remediation worked? Propose measurable metrics:
- Metadata consistency score (% of files with complete, non-contradicting frontmatter)
- Volatility alignment score (% of files at the correct celestial tier)
- Graph coherence (no orphans, no false peers, no stealth hubs)
- Compilation target (total Syncrescript token count fits in N-token context window)
