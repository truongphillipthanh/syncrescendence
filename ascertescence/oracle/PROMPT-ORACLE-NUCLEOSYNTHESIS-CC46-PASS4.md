This is your first and only context window. You have no memory of prior sessions. You will not see follow-up prompts or have a chance to revise.

## THE CORPUS

A public GitHub repo contains a single flat directory called `corpus/` with 13,364 files. Everything from this project — operational configs, research documents, agent protocols, scripts, logs, state files — was merged into this one directory. The original directory structure was destroyed; filenames now encode former paths using hyphens (e.g., a file originally at `scaffold/agents/commander/memory/MEMORY.md` became `-scaffold-agents-commander-memory-MEMORY.md.md`).

File types: `.md` (majority), `.py`, `.sh`, `.yaml`, `.json`, `.jsonl`, `.csv`, `.plist`, `.ipynb`, `.gitkeep`.

All YAML frontmatter was stripped. Filenames are the only metadata. Many filenames are misleading.

**GitHub's web UI will truncate the file listing.** Use the GitHub API or your own traversal methods to access files beyond the first page. There are 13,364 files — if you see fewer than a few thousand, you're being truncated.

## PRIOR ANALYSIS TO AUDIT

Three independent analysts examined this corpus. Their findings are below. **Your job is to verify and correct their work by reading actual files in the repo.**

### Analyst 1 — Substance ("What's in the pile?")
[COMMANDER INSERTS PASS 1 SUMMARY HERE]

### Analyst 2 — Topology ("What connects to what?")
[COMMANDER INSERTS PASS 2 SUMMARY HERE]

### Analyst 3 — Margins ("What did others miss?")
[COMMANDER INSERTS PASS 3 SUMMARY HERE]

## YOUR TASK

**Where are the three analysts wrong?**

Go to the repo. Read files. Verify claims. Specifically:

1. **Contradictions**: Where do the three analyses disagree? Who is right? Or are they all wrong?

2. **Misclassifications**: Spot-check Analyst 1's groupings by reading the actual files. Are files placed in the right group?

3. **Fabricated connections**: Did Analyst 2 claim connections that don't exist in the code? Follow the references. Are they real?

4. **Blind spots all three share**: What's in the corpus that NONE of the three analysts mentioned? Every analyst has biases — what slipped through all of them?

5. **Clusters that should merge or split**: Based on actual content, are there groupings treated as separate that are really one thing? Or groupings lumped together that are actually distinct?

**Do NOT propose a directory structure.** Your job is error correction only. Find what's wrong so the final synthesis is built on accurate observation, not accumulated assumptions.

What is the single biggest error across all three analyses?
