# PASS 4 OF 4: INSPECTION

Final pass. You've built a picture across three passes — substance, topology, margins. Now audit yourself.

**Where are you wrong?**

Go back. Re-read files. Be ruthlessly honest:

1. **Spot-check 5 files** you classified in Pass 1. Re-read them. Were you right, or did you infer from the filename?

2. **Verify 3 connections** from Pass 2. Follow the actual import/reference. Real or fabricated?

3. **Revisit 3 margin files** from Pass 3. Did you actually read the `.jsonl`/`.xml`/`.plist`, or describe what you expected?

4. **Find what ALL THREE passes missed**: Go to a random spot in the file listing you haven't visited. Read 5 files you've never cited. What are they?

5. **Your biggest bias**: Looking across all 3 passes, what did you systematically over-index on? What did you avoid?

6. **Merge/split**: Are there groupings you treated as separate that are really one thing? Groupings you lumped that are actually distinct?

7. **Dead weight estimate** — across all 13,364 files:
   - **Living signal** (actively used, referenced, unique value): ___%
   - **Archaeological** (once useful, now superseded): ___%
   - **Pure noise** (flattening duplicates, empty placeholders, broken artifacts): ___%

**Write at maximum length.** This is the error-correction pass. Where was your analysis lazy? Where did you follow the comfortable path? What's the single biggest correction to the picture painted by Passes 1-3?
