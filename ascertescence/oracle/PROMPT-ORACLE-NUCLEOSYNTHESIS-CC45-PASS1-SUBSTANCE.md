## Repo

**GitHub**: https://github.com/truongphillipthanh/syncrescendence (branch: `main`)

**The corpus**: https://github.com/truongphillipthanh/syncrescendence/tree/main/corpus

13,364 files. One flat directory. No hierarchy. No metadata (frontmatter stripped). Just raw content and filenames.

There is also `canon/` (87 protected files — ignore for this exercise).

## What This Is

One person's entire AI-augmented operational archive. Everything they've captured, created, configured, logged, decided, prompted, received, scripted, and recorded over months of building a multi-agent AI system — all dumped into a single flat directory.

## What I Need

Walk through the corpus on GitHub. Open files across the full spectrum of naming patterns — SOURCE files, AGENT files, SCRIPT files, ENGINE files, DYN files, RESPONSE files, ARCH files, NOTEBOOK files, META files, PROMPT files, CONFIRM files, RESULT files, logs, configs, everything. Read enough to understand what each file actually contains, not just what the filename implies.

Then tell me: **what did you find?**

For each natural grouping you discover:
- A name (your own)
- What unifies the group — the gravitational center
- Approximate file count
- 3-5 example filenames spanning different file types within the group
- What surprised you about this group (content that didn't match what you expected from the filename, or unexpected connections between files with different naming patterns)

Don't aim for a specific number of groups. Let them emerge. If two groups feel like they should merge, merge them. If one group feels like it contains multitudes, split it.

The only thing I'm asking for is: **what's actually here?** Not what to do with it. Not how to organize it. Just what you see when you look.
