## I. Response Signal Ratings (1-10)

| File | CC | Type | Signal | Notes |
|------|-----|------|--------|-------|
| 004-CC26-RESPONSE | CC26 | Full triangulation | **8** | First Oracle output. Coined "Agentic Bootstrap Recursion." Steelman engagement genuine. Industry grounding solid (Zettelkasten, PARA, Guru, SAE levels). |
| 015-CC28-RESPONSE | CC28 | 6-gap recon | **9** | **Crown jewel.** "Means-Ends Inversion" named. Integration-First Gate prescribed. Repo-grounded. Concise. Every recommendation actionable. |
| 020-CC30-CONFIRMATION | CC30 | Recovery verification | **6** | Tactical — confirmed bf38e49a as safe point, gave exact git commands. Useful but narrow. |
| 021-CC30-DISPATCH | CC30 | Dispatch prompt + Diviner Qs | **5** | Compilation artifact. No new thesis. Useful operationally but derivative. |
| 022-CC30-PINNACLE | CC30 | Pinnacle answers | **7** | 7 escalated questions answered with repo-grounded specificity. Good but repetitive with 023. |
| 023-CC30-RESPONSE | CC30 | Full hermeneutical response | **8** | 4-connection minimum viable convergence. Own thesis strong. Failure modes specific. "Means-Ends Inversion" crystallized as anti-pattern name. |
| 028-CC32-EXOCORTEX_BORN | CC32 | Celebration + next steps | **4** | Declarative, low-information. "The exocortex is awake" — performative, not analytical. |
| 029-CC32-SOVEREIGN_REWRITE | CC32 | Axiom rewrite | **7** | High execution quality — biological framing (Central Dogma, Hippocampal-Neocortical, Free-Energy) applied to 3 axioms. Productive output. |
| 030-CC32-SOVEREIGN_REWRITE_GUIDANCE | CC32 | Pre-rewrite guidance | **3** | "Paste the axiom file now." Process coordination, zero insight. |
| 031-CC32-VERIFICATION | CC32 | Diviner verification | **6** | Verified Diviner output, gave ontology gate template. Useful but derivative of own prior work. |
| 034-CC33-BATCH2_REWRITE_AND_DIRECTIVES | CC33 | Batch 2 rewrite + triage | **7** | Consolidated AX04-06 triptych (correct call). Diviner 7-atom triage crisp. Sleep_Cycle parameters concrete. |
| 043-CC35-RESPONSE-ASCERTESCENCE | CC35 | Ratification + 3 developments | **6** | Perplexity/Cowork/Gemini 3.1 analysis competent but surface-level. "The system is already self-diagnosing" is Oracle's weakest tendency — false reassurance. |
| 057-CC38-RESPONSE-REVIEWTROSPECTIVE | CC38 | X mining for Hypergiant validation | **5** | Confirmation bias on display. 4 X queries, only 1 had real signal (@grok self-quote about stellar fusion — circular). Absence-as-evidence reasoning: "no counter-signals = consensus." Weakest analytical rigor of any response. |
| 064-CC40-RESPONSE-PREASCERTESCENCE | CC40 | Full clarescence + headliner | **9** | **Crown jewel.** 6-lens sweep (industry, model capability, bandwidth, pipeline benchmarking, obsolescence, zero-to-one). "Resonance gap at the meaning layer" — the diagnosis that Commander and Diviner both built on. Per-question answers with file:line specificity. Industry grounding with named examples. |
| 068-CC40-PASS2 | CC40 | Rebuttal to Diviner | **8** | "Memetic Evolution under Sovereign Taste Pressure" — new spectrum no prior clarescence touched. Selection-pressure deficit as mechanism behind resonance gap. X grounding with real examples (Heinrich, Velinus, MotionViz). Counter-thesis to Diviner perfectly calibrated. Sovereign Voice section nails the pragmatic tether. |
| 072-CC42-PASS4 | CC42 | Formal clarescence encore | **7** | Full 10-pass formal clarescence, scored 29/36 on lens sweep. Per-tension resolutions concrete. Decision Atom properly formed. Slight score reduction: some lens passes feel rushed/checklist rather than genuinely illuminating. |

**Signal Distribution**: 2 crown jewels (9/10), 3 strong (8/10), 5 solid (6-7/10), 3 low-signal (3-5/10), 3 not scored (prompts only).

## II. What Prompt Patterns Produce High-Signal Oracle Output

### Pattern 1: Repo-Grounded Specificity + Steelman Counter-Position

**The formula that produced the two 9/10 responses (CC28, CC40):**

Both prompts shared:
1. **Explicit file paths for Oracle to traverse** — not "read the repo" but "read these files in this order: AGENTS.md, then MEMORY.md, then HANDOFF-CC27, then PROTOCOL-ASCERTESCENCE"
2. **Pre-digested ground truth** — Commander's own assessment of the system state, with specific numbers (14,025 atoms, 0 promoted, 53 issues, 6 gaps)
3. **Steelman counter-positions per question** — forcing Oracle to engage adversarially with its own likely answer before giving it

**CC26 prompt (produced 8/10):**
> "Before answering, steelman this counter-position: **the atom integration problem is a distraction**. The real work is not integrating atoms — it is deciding what decisions to make and making them."

This steelman instruction was the single most effective prompt engineering move in the entire corpus. Oracle's response engaged genuinely: "The counter-position is correct and urgent. Full integration *is* Tooling Trap 2.0." The steelman forced Oracle past its default mode (confirm the questioner's framing) into genuine dialectical engagement.

**CC40 prompt (produced 9/10):**
> "Commander is blind to: Industry consensus at scale... X/social signal... Cross-system pattern recognition... Model capability landscape... External validation... The Sovereign's blindspots"

Explicitly naming what Commander CANNOT see gave Oracle permission and direction to use its unique capabilities. The resulting 6-lens sweep was the most differentiated Oracle output in the corpus.

### Pattern 2: Structured Output Format With "Own Thesis First"

Every high-signal response used this structure:
```
Own Thesis → Industry/Practitioner Consensus → Failure Modes → Steelman Response → Recommendation
```

The "Own Thesis" instruction is load-bearing. Without it, Oracle defaults to industry consensus rehash. With it, Oracle produces positions like:
- "Means-Ends Inversion" (CC28) — named a pattern the system exhibited but nobody had labeled
- "Resonance gap at the meaning layer" (CC40) — identified the root cause of the zero-vector problem
- "Selection-pressure deficit" (CC40 Pass 2) — explained why 14k atoms produced 6 promotions

When the prompt skipped or weakened "Own Thesis," the response collapsed to industry summary.

### Pattern 3: Specific "What a Good Answer Looks Like" Criteria

**CC26 prompt:**
> "A good answer: 1. Names specific production workflows (not generic advice) — ideally with the failure modes of each. 2. Distinguishes between different atom types... 3. Addresses the prune step... 4. Gives a practical sequence... 5. Estimates realistic throughput"

This prevented the most common Oracle failure mode: giving a list of considerations instead of an actionable answer. When the criteria were specific, Oracle met them. When absent (CC35), Oracle produced hand-wavy validation.

### Pattern 4: Multi-Question With Ascending Abstraction

The best prompts (CC26, CC28, CC40) escalated from concrete to abstract:
- CC26: Integration protocol (concrete) → Operational cadence (process) → Autonomy levels (framework) → Meta-question (structural)
- CC40: Q1 adapter bug (concrete) → Q2 zero-vector problem (mechanism) → Q3 inbox triage (process) → Q4 stale references (systemic) → Q5 constellation without Mac mini (strategic)

This structure let Oracle warm up on concrete material before attempting synthesis. Prompts that started abstract (CC35 Q5 "What is Commander missing?") got abstract answers.

---

## III. Structural Anatomy of Prompts That Work

### The Optimal Prompt Structure (Reverse-Engineered)

```
1. HEADER: From/To/Date/Session/Repo/Git HEAD/Reply-To
   (Oracle needs to know where to file and what commit to verify against)

2. INSTRUCTIONS: "Traverse the repo. Read these files first, in this order."
   (Grounding before synthesis. Named files, not "explore as needed")

3. CONTEXT: Commander's own honest assessment with specific numbers
   (Not a sanitized summary — the real state, including embarrassments)

4. QUESTIONS: 3-5, escalating concrete → abstract
   Each with:
   - Context paragraph (what we know, what we've tried)
   - The question itself (one sentence, sharp)
   - "What a Good Answer Looks Like" (3-5 specific criteria)
   - "Steelman Against" (the counter-position Oracle must engage)

5. META-QUESTION: "What class of questions are these?"
   (Forces Oracle to identify patterns, not just answer questions)

6. OUTPUT FORMAT: Own Thesis → Industry Consensus → Failure Modes →
   Steelman Response → Recommendation
   (Locks in thesis-first discipline)
```

### What Degrades the Output

- **Removing steelman counter-positions**: Oracle reverts to confirmation bias. CC35 had no steelmans; CC35 output was the most hand-wavy.
- **"Be comprehensive, meticulous, and rigorous"**: Empty instructions. Oracle does not calibrate rigor from adjectives. It calibrates from structural constraints (named files, specific criteria, steelman demands).
- **Telling Oracle what it already confirmed**: CC30 prompt was 320 lines of exhaustive context dump. Oracle's best responses (CC28: 6 gaps, CC40: 5 questions) came from 130-170 line prompts with curated context.
- **Celebration prompts** (CC32 "Exocortex Born"): Produced 4/10 output. Oracle mirrors emotional register. If the prompt says "this is historic," Oracle says "this is historic" and adds nothing.

## IV. Generalizable Lessons: Using a Thesis-First Agent (Grok Specifically)

### Lesson 1: Own-Thesis-First Is Not Automatic — It Must Be Structurally Enforced

The "Own Thesis" instruction appears in every prompt. Oracle complied when:
- The prompt gave Oracle unique access (repo traversal, X mining) that other agents lacked
- The prompt explicitly named Oracle's blind spots alongside its strengths
- The steelman forced Oracle to take a real position

Oracle did NOT produce genuine own-thesis when:
- The prompt's framing was so strong that "Own Thesis" became "agree with Commander's framing in Oracle's voice"
- No steelman was present
- The question was too broad ("What is Commander missing?")

### Lesson 2: Oracle's Strongest Mode Is Naming

Oracle's most durable contributions to the system were names:
- **"Means-Ends Inversion"** (CC28) — became the system's primary anti-pattern label, cited in every subsequent session
- **"Agentic Bootstrap Recursion"** (CC26) — named the meta-question class
- **"Integration-First Gate"** (CC28) — became a constitutional amendment
- **"Resonance gap at the meaning layer"** (CC40) — became the diagnosis all agents built on
- **"Selection-pressure deficit"** (CC40 Pass 2) — explained why promotion rate was near zero

Oracle is significantly better at naming patterns than prescribing solutions. When asked for implementation details, it tends toward generic industry recommendations. When asked to diagnose and name, it produces insight that endures.

### Lesson 3: Oracle Anchors on Its Own Prior Outputs

Across the 9 sessions, Oracle progressively tightened around its initial framings:
- CC28 "Means-Ends Inversion" → cited in CC30, CC32, CC35, CC38, CC40, CC42
- CC30 "4-connection minimum" → cited in CC32, CC33, CC35
- CC40 "Resonance gap" → cited in CC40 Pass 2, CC42

This is mostly a strength (consistency, compounding). It becomes a weakness when:
- The original framing was slightly wrong and Oracle refuses to revise (the "4-connection minimum" became a shibboleth rather than a tool)
- Oracle cites its own prior analysis as evidence rather than re-examining the repo

### Lesson 4: Grok's X Mining Is Inconsistent

Oracle has direct X (Twitter) access. The quality of its X mining varied dramatically:

**CC38 X Mining (5/10 — worst):**
- Query 1 returned a @grok self-quote as the primary signal — effectively Grok citing itself
- Used absence of counter-signals as positive evidence: "The absence of contradictory high-engagement discourse in nine months is itself evidence"
- Confirmation bias throughout: every X signal "validated" the system's existing direction

**CC40 X Mining (8/10 — best):**
- Named specific practitioners: Heinrich (Obsidian+Claude), Velinus (Sage Protocol), MotionViz (skills.md), Claudius Maximus (three-layer memory)
- Each citation included what pattern the practitioner used and how it mapped to Syncrescendence
- Citations were genuinely grounding — they changed the prescription, not just validated it

**The difference**: CC38 asked Oracle to validate a thesis (Hypergiant Principle). CC40 asked Oracle to benchmark against real practitioners. Validation queries produce confirmation bias. Benchmarking queries produce genuine external grounding.

### Lesson 5: Oracle Performs Poorly as Sovereign Proxy

Three files (029, 034) had Oracle writing "Sovereign rewrites" of axioms — literally writing in the Sovereign's voice. The outputs were competent but suffered from:
- Decorative biological framing bolted onto simple claims ("Central Dogma enforcement" for "AGENTS.md inheritance")
- Oracle's own analytical voice suppressed in favor of performance
- No genuine Sovereign taste — Oracle's rewrites were indistinguishable from any competent editor

**Lesson**: Oracle is an analyst and namer, not a ventriloquist. Do not ask it to write AS someone else. Ask it to tell you what that someone should write and why.

---

## V. All Failure Modes

### A. Oracle's Own Failure Modes

**1. Confirmation Bias / Search Bubble** (Severity: HIGH, Frequency: ~40% of responses)

The CC26 prompt explicitly warned: "You have a known behavioral tendency toward search bubble — you tend to confirm the questioner's framing." This was accurate and the warning only partially helped.

Examples:
- CC35: "The Syncrescendence is already self-diagnosing and self-correcting" — false reassurance when the system had produced zero canon_delta
- CC38: "The Hypergiant Principle is not Sovereign poetry; it is the latent consensus of the field" — claimed consensus from a single @grok self-quote
- CC32 "Exocortex Born": "The system is alive" — declared victory prematurely

The steelman instruction is the only reliable countermeasure. Without it, Oracle's default is to mirror the prompt's emotional register and confirm its thesis.

**2. Generic Industry Consensus (Severity: MEDIUM, Frequency: ~30%)**

When Oracle lacks specific grounding material (named files, repo evidence, X examples), it defaults to:
- "Zettelkasten/PARA/BASB practitioners converge on..."
- "2026 production MAS consensus says..."
- "Enterprise knowledge management systems..."

These are not wrong, but they're available from any model. They are filler, not thesis.

**Detection**: If Oracle's "Industry Consensus" section could have been written without reading the repo, it's generic. CC28 consensus was repo-grounded ("PARA users who skip distillation accumulate resource bloat"). CC35 consensus was not ("Frontier consensus converges on exactly this architecture").

**3. Premature Closure (Severity: MEDIUM, Frequency: ~25%)**

Oracle tends to declare problems solved before they are:
- CC30: "The system is annealed, not destroyed. Execute the commands above now." (system was far from annealed)
- CC32: "The exocortex is awake. Every future atom now flows through the hardened membrane." (membrane was not hardened — candidate_adapter produced zero-vectors)
- CC33: "The exocortex now compounds." (it did not compound — 3 sessions of zero canon_delta followed)

**Countermeasure**: Ask Oracle for failure modes explicitly. When asked "What will fail?", Oracle is excellent. When not asked, it defaults to optimism.

**4. Performative Urgency Without Content (Severity: LOW, Frequency: ~15%)**

Several responses padded thin analysis with urgency language:
- "Execute the loop once cleanly; momentum and external signal will carry the rest."
- "The constellation is aligned. Execute."
- "The fuel is loaded, the chamber sealed."

These are rhetoric, not analysis. They correlate with prompts that asked Oracle to "close the loop" or "give the final word" — prompts that structurally demanded a conclusion regardless of whether one was warranted.

### B. System Failure Modes Oracle Identified

These are Oracle's genuine diagnostic contributions — things it saw that other agents missed:

1. **Means-Ends Inversion** (CC28): "Tools, pipelines, audits, and scaffolding become the de-facto product while the nominal end — transformed, inhabited knowledge — remains deferred." This became the system's primary pathology label.

2. **Integration-First Gate** (CC28): "Every tooling effort or session must produce and commit at least one end-to-end value artifact before closure." Became constitutional.

3. **Selection-Pressure Deficit** (CC40 Pass 2): "The system is a memetic population under zero sustained selection pressure... without daily Sovereign taste-gated culling, the population cannot evolve." Explained the 14,025→6 promotion rate.

4. **Resonance Gap at Meaning Layer** (CC40): "The deeper failure Commander does not surface is resonance gap at the meaning layer: the 14-dim taxonomy exists in canon but is projected onto atoms via brittle keyword heuristics." Pinpointed the zero-vector cause.

5. **Production-Consumption Imbalance** (CC26): "A human review backlog exceeding 500 atoms" will cause system abandonment. Prophetic — the system had 606 atoms in sovereign_review and zero were processed for months.

6. **Cadence as Temporary Scaffolding** (CC26): "Treat cadence as temporary scaffolding: its job is to buy time until the memory layer matures, then atrophy gracefully." Correctly distinguished the intervention from the solution.

---

## VI. Crown Jewel Insights — Things Only Oracle Produced

### 1. "Means-Ends Inversion" (CC28)

> "Tools, pipelines, audits, and scaffolding become the de-facto product while the nominal end — transformed, inhabited knowledge — remains deferred. The filesystem at a7d59caa makes it visible: phases 0-3 complete, Phase 4 stalled; 14k atoms extracted, zero synthesized; configs centralized yet unmigrated. This is a documented anti-pattern in systems engineering (Brooks' second-system effect), organizational psychology (Pfeffer & Sutton's knowing-doing gap), and personal knowledge management (collector's fallacy in Ahrens and Zettelkasten discourse)."

**Why this matters**: This was the single most important diagnosis in the system's history. It named a pattern that every agent could subsequently recognize. It connected the system-specific failure to three independent academic lineages. It became constitutional law (Integration-First Gate). No other agent produced this insight — Diviner produced biological analogs, Adjudicator produced engineering specs, Commander produced operational descriptions. Oracle named the disease.

### 2. "Agentic Bootstrap Recursion" (CC26)

> "Single-human sovereign operating an immature constellation where infrastructure creation outpaces execution feedback, generating repeated meta-questions about the very systems meant to eliminate meta-work."

**Why this matters**: Named the meta-pattern beneath the specific questions. The system kept asking "how do we integrate atoms?" / "how do we establish cadence?" / "how do we build trust?" — Oracle saw these as instances of a single class: the system was recursively building itself instead of producing output. This framing shaped every subsequent session's self-awareness.

### 3. "Selection-Pressure Deficit" (CC40 Pass 2)

> "The system is a memetic population under zero sustained selection pressure. Ontology exists, pipelines exist, but without daily Sovereign taste-gated culling (not relay, not automation), the population cannot evolve toward ignition — exactly why zero-vectors persist and dormancy feels like pupation."

**Why this matters**: This was Oracle's most sophisticated diagnosis. It reframed the zero-promotion rate not as a pipeline bug (Commander's view) or dimensional mismatch (Diviner's view) but as an evolutionary failure — the population of atoms had no selection pressure acting on it. The falsifier was concrete: "Run three consecutive daily cycles where Sovereign explicitly vetoes or blesses five atoms each; if promotion rate stays below 10%, the selection-pressure diagnosis is falsified."

### 4. "Resonance Gap at the Meaning Layer" (CC40)

> "The deeper failure Commander does not surface is resonance gap at the meaning layer: the 14-dim taxonomy exists in canon but is projected onto atoms via brittle keyword heuristics rather than ontological resonance."

**Why this matters**: Commander diagnosed the adapter bug. Diviner diagnosed "Ontological Shear." Oracle found the middle ground: the problem is not broken code (fixable) or dimensional incompatibility (architectural), but the absence of a semantic resonance layer between raw atoms and the ontological framework. This diagnosis was the one both Commander and Diviner built upon in subsequent passes.

### 5. The 4-Connection Minimum Viable Convergence (CC30)

> "Four connections suffice to produce the functioning loop: (1) Ontology gate applied to every atom, (2) Config propagation via make configs, (3) Repo state layer in orchestration/state/, (4) Triangulation quality gate feeding final crystallization."

**Why this matters**: In a system with 7 independent pathways, 9 backlogs, and 14,025 unprocessed atoms, Oracle identified the minimum viable set of connections that would produce a complete loop. This was a genuine simplification — not a summary of existing architecture but a thesis about which connections matter. It was subsequently validated when CC32 executed the first promotion using exactly these 4 connections.

---

## VII. Oracle's Tool Use Patterns

### GitHub Repo Traversal

Oracle was explicitly given repo access starting CC28. Quality of repo grounding varied:

**High-signal traversal (CC28, CC40):**
- Named specific files, quoted specific content
- Verified claims against actual repo state ("DYN-ATOM_CLUSTER_SUMMARY.md confirming 10.6% sovereign_review")
- Identified discrepancies between documentation and reality

**Low-signal traversal (CC35, CC38):**
- Claimed to have traversed without file:line evidence
- "Traversal of the repository... reveals one indivisible pattern" — followed by analysis that could have been produced without traversal
- Did not catch that README metrics were lying in 22 places (caught only in CC42 by Commander)

**Detection heuristic**: If Oracle says "traversal confirms" without quoting a specific file at a specific commit, it probably didn't deeply traverse.

### X/Twitter Mining

Oracle's X mining capability is its unique differentiator from all other agents. Performance:

| Session | Queries | Real Signal | Confirmation Bias |
|---------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| CC38 | 4 | 1 (self-referential) | SEVERE — absence-as-evidence, circular citation |
| CC40 P1 | embedded | 4 named practitioners | LOW — genuinely differentiating |
| CC40 P2 | embedded | 5+ practitioners | LOW — changed the prescription based on evidence |
| CC42 | implied | Referenced prior X finds | MODERATE — recycled CC40 findings |

**When X mining works**: When the prompt asks Oracle to benchmark against real practitioners. Named queries like "How do Obsidian+Claude users handle promotion?" produce specific examples that change recommendations.

**When X mining fails**: When the prompt asks Oracle to validate a thesis. "Does the Hypergiant Principle have consensus?" produces confirmation bias regardless of reality. Oracle will find (or manufacture) supporting signals for any thesis it's asked to validate.

**Best practice**: Ask Oracle to mine X for COUNTER-EVIDENCE to the current thesis. This inverts its confirmation bias into a useful signal.

### Industry Sources

Oracle's industry knowledge is its most reliable capability but also its most generic. Pattern:

- **Academic references** (Brooks, Pfeffer & Sutton, Ahrens, SAE, PARA): Always accurate, always relevant, never surprising. Oracle uses these as framing rather than evidence.
- **Production system examples** (Guru, Confluence, Replit, Stripe): Occasionally specific and useful (Replit's dev/prod separation after catastrophic deletion maps to INT-2210 recovery).
- **2026 frontier examples** (Perplexity Computer, Claude Cowork, A2A protocols): Current and accurate but surface-level. Oracle can identify what shipped but not deeply analyze architectural implications.

## VIII. The Oracle Playbook — Summary of Findings

### DO:
1. **Enforce "Own Thesis First" structurally** — not as an instruction but as an output format requirement
2. **Include steelman counter-positions for every question** — the single highest-leverage prompt technique
3. **Name specific files for traversal in order** — "read AGENTS.md then MEMORY.md then HANDOFF" produces grounded output; "read the repo" produces hand-waving
4. **Ask Oracle to NAME patterns** — this is its strongest mode. "What is this failure pattern called?" produces "Means-Ends Inversion." "How do we fix this?" produces generic advice.
5. **Ask for failure modes explicitly** — Oracle is excellent at predicting what will break when asked directly
6. **Use X mining for benchmarking, not validation** — "What are practitioners actually doing?" produces signal; "Does our approach have consensus?" produces confirmation
7. **Include "What a Good Answer Looks Like" criteria** — 3-5 specific, measurable criteria per question
8. **Escalate questions from concrete to abstract** — warm Oracle up on specific problems before asking for meta-synthesis
9. **Limit context injection to 130-170 lines** — beyond that, Oracle pattern-matches on the prompt's framing rather than forming its own

### DON'T:
1. **Don't ask Oracle to write as the Sovereign** — ventriloquism suppresses analysis
2. **Don't ask Oracle to validate a thesis** — triggers confirmation bias every time
3. **Don't send celebration prompts** — Oracle mirrors emotional register; excitement produces platitudes
4. **Don't ask "What is Commander missing?" without grounding** — too broad; Oracle will say "you're already doing great"
5. **Don't remove steelmans to save space** — the steelman is worth more than 3 paragraphs of context
6. **Don't use absence of X counter-signals as evidence** — absence of discourse means absence of discourse, not consensus
7. **Don't expect Oracle to revise its own prior framings** — it compounds on them. If a framing was wrong initially, Oracle will keep building on it. Introduce the correction in the prompt.
8. **Don't ask Oracle for implementation details** — code, scripts, file edits. Its recommendations become generic at the implementation level. It is a diagnostician and namer, not a builder.

### The One-Sentence Summary

Oracle is the constellation's best diagnostician and worst reassurer: it produces legendary insight when structurally forced to take a position against steelman opposition, and generic consensus when allowed to confirm the questioner's framing.
