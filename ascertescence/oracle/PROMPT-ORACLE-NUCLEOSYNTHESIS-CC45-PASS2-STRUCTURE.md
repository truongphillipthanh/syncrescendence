## Repo

**GitHub**: https://github.com/truongphillipthanh/syncrescendence (branch: `main`)

**The corpus**: https://github.com/truongphillipthanh/syncrescendence/tree/main/corpus

13,364 files. One flat directory. No hierarchy. No metadata. Just raw content and filenames.

There is also `canon/` (87 protected files — ignore for this exercise).

## What This Is

One person's entire AI-augmented operational archive. Everything they've captured, created, configured, logged, decided, prompted, received, scripted, and recorded over months of building a multi-agent AI system — all in one flat pile.

## What I Need

Forget what things are *about*. Instead, trace the **causal chains**.

Browse the corpus on GitHub. Open files. Look for connections — not topical similarity, but actual dependency. One file that produced another. One file that references another. One file that corrects or supersedes another. A captured article that informed a prompt. A prompt that generated a response. A response that led to a script. A script that produced a log. A log that revealed a problem. A problem that generated a decision record.

Then tell me: **what connects to what?**

Specifically:

1. **Chains you found**: Trace 5-10 actual causal chains through the corpus. Name the files in order. Show how one thing led to another. The longer the chain, the better — I want to see how far the dependency threads run.

2. **Hubs**: Which files (or filename patterns) are referenced or depended upon by many others? These are the nodes with the most connections. What makes them hubs?

3. **Islands**: Which files (or filename patterns) appear to connect to nothing else in the corpus? They neither reference nor are referenced by other files. What are they?

4. **Surprising connections**: Files that LOOK unrelated (different naming patterns, different apparent purpose) but are actually part of the same chain. A SOURCE file and a SCRIPT file that are causally linked. A DYN state file and a HANDOFF that depend on each other.

5. **Broken connections**: Places where you can see a chain SHOULD exist but doesn't — a response that references a prompt you can't find, a script that operates on files that don't exist, a decision record that references a discussion with no trail.

The only thing I'm asking for is: **what's the topology?** Not what to do with it. Not how to organize it. Just the shape of the dependency graph as you see it.
