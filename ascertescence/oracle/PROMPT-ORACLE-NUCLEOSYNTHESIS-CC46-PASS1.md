This is your first and only context window. You have no memory of prior sessions.

## YOUR TASK

You are looking at a single flat directory called `corpus/` containing 13,364 files. These files were created by merging three former directories (scaffold/, sources/, logs/) into one pile and stripping all YAML frontmatter. The filenames often encode their former path using hyphens (e.g., `-scaffold-agents-commander-memory-MEMORY.md.md` was originally `scaffold/agents/commander/memory/MEMORY.md`).

The files include: markdown documents, Python scripts, shell scripts, YAML configs, JSON state files, CSV ledgers, .plist files, Jupyter notebooks, and gitkeep placeholders. They span topics from AI model research to consciousness philosophy to operational infrastructure to agent coordination protocols.

**Your one question: What's in this pile?**

Walk the corpus via the GitHub link above. Read files — not just filenames. Open documents across the full range. Sample broadly: old files and new, short and long, markdown and code, files with recognizable prefixes and files with none.

For each natural grouping you discover, report:
- What the grouping IS (substance, not label)
- 3-5 specific filenames that exemplify it
- What surprised you about the content vs. what the filename suggested
- Rough percentage of the corpus this grouping accounts for

**If you find yourself listing filename prefixes and pattern-matching without reading file contents, stop.** The filenames are often misleading — they encode former directory paths, not semantic meaning. A file called `ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md` might be a living strategic document or a dead placeholder. You won't know without reading it.

**Do NOT propose a directory structure, type system, or routing table.** You are sensing, not prescribing. Report what you observe. That's all.

What surprised you most? What doesn't fit anywhere? What's the ratio of living signal to dead weight?
