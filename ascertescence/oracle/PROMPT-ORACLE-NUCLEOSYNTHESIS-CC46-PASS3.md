# PASS 3 OF 4: MARGINS

Good. You've mapped substance (Pass 1) and topology (Pass 2). Both passes gravitatated toward the most visible files. Now go to the margins.

**What did your first two passes skip?**

Same repo: https://github.com/truongphillipthanh/syncrescendence/tree/main/corpus

Reminder — the corpus is 13,364 files: 7,752 .md, 4,599 .jsonl, 237 .log, 145 .sh, 126 .py, 94 .gitkeep, 92 .plist, 75 .yaml, 56 .json, 42 .xml, 37 .csv.

**Specific targets** — read these, not the obvious stuff:

1. **The 94 `.gitkeep` files**: Their flattened names encode the original directory tree. Read 10-15. What architecture do they reveal?
   - e.g., `-scaffold-agents-adjudicator-memory-cache-GRAPHITI_ENTITIES-.gitkeep.gitkeep` = there was a `scaffold/agents/adjudicator/memory/cache/GRAPHITI_ENTITIES/` directory.

2. **The 4,599 `.jsonl` files**: Biggest non-.md category. Are they all EXTRACT atoms? Open 10 across different prefixes and dates. What's in them?

3. **Files from 2020-2024**: The project started ~2025 but has content from 2002, 2019, 2021-2024. Open `SOURCE-20020201-website-article-paulgraham-taste_for_makers.md`, `SOURCE-20210528-*`, `SOURCE-20220906-*`. Still relevant?

4. **Flattening duplicates**: e.g., `auto_ingest_loop.sh` AND `auto_ingest_loop-scaffold-scripts-root-auto_ingest_loop.sh.sh`. Open pairs. Are they identical content or different versions?

5. **The 42 `.xml` files** (`ENGINE-FUNC-*.xml`): What schema? What do they define?

6. **The 92 `.plist` files**: macOS launchd daemons. Which services?

7. **Unprefixed orphans** (~52 files): `20260120-211621.json`, `active.json`, `linear-status-check.md`, `stream3-perplexity.md`. What are these?

8. **The 34 PRAXIS files**: Operational wisdom. Living playbooks or dead docs?

For each finding: **quote content, say signal or noise, flag surprises.**

**Write at maximum length.** What's the most surprising thing hiding in the margins? What changes the picture from your first two passes?
