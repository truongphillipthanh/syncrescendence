## A. Volatility Audit

Every file in `canon/` assessed against a four-band volatility scale. Current celestial tier compared against actual content shelf-life. Mismatches flagged.

### Volatility Bands

| Band | Shelf-Life | Update Cadence | Content Signature |
|------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **PERMANENT** | 5+ years | Only on reconception | Principles, origin, philosophy, developmental stage models |
| **STABLE** | 2–5 years | Annual review | Architectural frameworks, governance protocols, methodology |
| **MODERATE** | 1–2 years | Semi-annual review | Strategy, operational protocols, methodology with embedded specifics |
| **DYNAMIC** | < 1 year | Quarterly or faster | Tool inventories, platform catalogs, cost figures, dated snapshots |

### Full Audit Table

#### Cosmos Tier (00000–00017 + protocols + gates)

| File | Assessed Volatility | Verdict | Key Issue |
|------|-------------------|---------|-----------|

| 00004 Evolution | MODERATE | **MISMATCH** | Living history doc filed alongside permanent foundations |
| 00005 Syncrescendence | STABLE | MATCH | Self-declares quarterly but core doctrine is 2–5yr stable |
| 00006 Corpus | DYNAMIC | **MISMATCH** | Already 15 files behind; a manifest is inherently dynamic |
| 00007 Evaluation | MODERATE | MATCH | — |
| 00009 Strategy | MODERATE | MATCH | Technology timeline dates will need recalibration |
| 00010 Operations | MODERATE | MATCH | Self-declares monthly; structural protocols are 1–2yr |

| apoptosis_protocol | STABLE | MATCH | — |
| retirement_protocol | STABLE | MATCH | — |
| Ontology Gate v1 | STABLE | MATCH | — |
| Ontology Gate v2 | STABLE | MATCH | — |

**Cosmos mismatches: 5 of 21 files.** Pattern: cosmos correctly holds permanent/stable constitutional content, but also houses several MODERATE/DYNAMIC operational files (00004, 00006, 00014, 00017) that don't belong at the same volatility tier as the Origin story and Principles.

#### Core Tier (10000–11000)

| File | Assessed Volatility | Verdict |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| 10000 Celestial Body | PERMANENT | MATCH |
| 11000 Facets | PERMANENT | MATCH |

**Core: 0 mismatches.** Perfect alignment — the practitioner identity layer is genuinely permanent.

#### Lattice Tier (20000–25610)

| File | Assessed Volatility | Verdict | Key Issue |
|------|-------------------|---------|-----------|
| 20000 Palace | STABLE | MATCH | — |
| 20010 Dim Coordinators | STABLE | MATCH | — |
| 20020 Meta-Systems | STABLE | MATCH | — |
| 21000 Chain Matrix | MODERATE | **MISMATCH** | Embeds tech maturity %s and revenue figures |
| 21100 Tri-Helix | MODERATE | **MISMATCH** | Calendar-anchored milestones from Oct 2025 |
| 22000 Interference | STABLE | MATCH | — |
| 23000 Lunar Nav | STABLE | MATCH | — |
| 24000 Omni-Quality | STABLE | MATCH | — |
| 25000 Memory Arch | MODERATE | **MISMATCH** | Graphiti v0.28.1, Neo4j, specific API calls |
| 25100 Context Trans | MODERATE | MATCH | — |
| 25200 Constellation Arch | DYNAMIC | **MISMATCH** | Exact costs ($100/mo), past sustainability target |
| 25500 Architecture Rationale | STABLE | MATCH | Historical — inherently permanent |
| 25600 Ascertescence Cycle | STABLE | MATCH | — |
| 25610 Diviner Formula | MODERATE | **MISMATCH** | Tied to Gemini CLI v0.30.0; document anticipates updates |

**Lattice mismatches: 5 of 16 files.** Pattern: the pure geometry files (Palace, Interference, Omni-Quality) are correctly placed. The operational specifications (25xxx) smuggle MODERATE/DYNAMIC implementation details into a STABLE tier. The 21xxx files embed dated figures into otherwise stable frameworks.

#### Chain Tier — Intelligence (30000–30460)

| File | Assessed Volatility | Content Type | Verdict | Key Issue |
|------|-------------------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| 30000 Intelligence | STABLE | REFERENCE | MATCH | — |
| 30100 ASA | STABLE | SUBSTRATE | MATCH | — |
| 30200 Positioning | DYNAMIC | STRATEGIC | **MISMATCH** | Corporate profiles; self-declares quarterly update |

| 30410 Cognitive Architecture | STABLE | SUBSTRATE | MATCH | — |
| 30420 Multi-Agent Orchestration | MODERATE | SUBSTRATE | MATCH | — |
| 30430 Memory Systems | MODERATE | SUBSTRATE | MATCH | — |
| 30440 Safety Alignment | MODERATE | SUBSTRATE | MATCH | — |
| 30450 Production Frameworks | DYNAMIC | OPERATIONS | **MISMATCH** | Month-by-month release dates, "Upcoming" sections already past |
| 30460 Interaction Dynamics | MODERATE | OPERATIONS | MATCH | — |

**Intelligence mismatches: 3 of 15 files.** But the content-type analysis reveals the deeper problem: this chain holds SUBSTRATE (30100, 30400–30440), REFERENCE (30000, 30320), OPERATIONS (30300, 30310, 30330, 30340, 30450, 30460), and STRATEGIC (30200) content — four fundamentally different genres.

#### Chain Tier — Information (31000–31150)

| File | Assessed Volatility | Verdict | Key Issue |
|------|-------------------|---------|-----------|
| 31000 Information | PERMANENT | MATCH | — |
| 31100 Acumen | STABLE | MATCH | — |
| 31110 Feedcraft | MODERATE | **MISMATCH** | Names specific platforms in topology |
| 31115 IIC Impl | DYNAMIC | **MISMATCH** | Daily tactical guide, tool-specific |
| 31120 Tone Library | STABLE | MATCH | — |
| 31121 Tone Taxonomy | STABLE | MATCH | — |
| 31122 Rhetorical | STABLE | MATCH | — |
| 31130 Seven Layer | MODERATE | **MISMATCH** | Framework stable, layer contents name specific tools |
| 31140 IIC | MODERATE | **MISMATCH** | Architecture stable, activation sequences platform-bound |
| 31141 Five Account | DYNAMIC | **MISMATCH** | Per-platform specs, automation configs |
| 31142 Platform Grammar | DYNAMIC | **MISMATCH** | Pure tactical interaction protocols |
| 31143 Feed Curation | STABLE | MATCH | — |
| 31150 Platform Catalog | DYNAMIC | **MISMATCH** | Auto-generated, self-declares temporal data |

**Information mismatches: 7 of 13 files.** The IIC sub-tree is the most volatility-misaligned cluster in the entire canon. The architectural parents (31000, 31100, 31120–31122, 31143) are correctly filed; the implementation children (31115, 31141, 31142, 31150) are DYNAMIC content wearing CANON credentials.

#### Chain Tier — Insight (32000–32120)

| File | Assessed Volatility | Verdict |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| 32000 Insight | PERMANENT | MATCH |
| 32100 Coherence | PERMANENT | MATCH |
| 32110 Coherence System | PERMANENT | MATCH |
| 32120 Meta-Analysis | STABLE | MATCH |

**Insight: 0 mismatches.** Pure conceptual architecture — the most correctly-tiered chain.

#### Chain Tier — Expertise (33000–33112)

| File | Assessed Volatility | Verdict |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| 33000 Expertise | PERMANENT | MATCH |
| 33100 Efficacy | PERMANENT | MATCH |
| 33110 Biz Backbone | MODERATE | MATCH |
| 33111 Biz Enhance | MODERATE | MATCH |
| 33112 Revenue Model | MODERATE | MATCH |

**Expertise: 0 mismatches.** Though 33110–33112 are MODERATE within a chain tier, business strategy at this abstraction level is appropriately housed.

#### Chain Tier — Knowledge (34000–34120)

| File | Assessed Volatility | Verdict | Key Issue |
|------|-------------------|---------|-----------|
| 34000 Knowledge | PERMANENT | MATCH | — |
| 34100 Mastery | PERMANENT | MATCH | — |
| 34110 Curriculum | STABLE | MATCH | — |
| 34120 Syllabus | DYNAMIC | **MISMATCH** | "October 2025 Tool Ecosystem" — already stale |

**Knowledge: 1 mismatch.** The Syllabus is the most explicitly time-stamped file in canon, and the sensing report already flagged it as the most perishable artifact.

#### Chain Tier — Wisdom (35000–35210)

| File | Assessed Volatility | Verdict | Key Issue |
|------|-------------------|---------|-----------|
| 35000 Wisdom | PERMANENT | MATCH | — |
| 35100 Transcendence | PERMANENT | MATCH | — |

| 35200 Gaian Node | MODERATE | **MISMATCH** | Physical infrastructure costs and tech specs |
| 35210 Metahumanism | PERMANENT | MATCH | — |

**Wisdom: 1 mismatch.** The Gaian Node's construction blueprint embeds implementation-grade volatility into a philosophical chain.

### Volatility Audit Summary

| | Total Files | Matches | Mismatches | Mismatch Rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cosmos | 21 | 16 | 5 | 24% |
| Core | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0% |
| Lattice | 16 | 11 | 5 | 31% |
| Intelligence | 15 | 12 | 3 | 20% |
| Information | 13 | 6 | 7 | 54% |
| Insight | 4 | 4 | 0 | 0% |
| Expertise | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0% |
| Knowledge | 4 | 3 | 1 | 25% |
| Wisdom | 7 | 6 | 1 | 14% |
| Archive | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0% |
| **TOTAL** | **88** | **66** | **22** | **25%** |

**22 files are volatility-misplaced — one quarter of the canon.** The mismatches cluster in two areas:
1. **Information chain's IIC sub-tree** (7 of 13 files) — tactical implementation details at canonical elevation
2. **Intelligence chain** (3 of 15) + **Lattice operations** (5 of 16) — operational specs and dated snapshots in stable-tier containers

The mismatches all go in one direction: **DYNAMIC/MODERATE content elevated to STABLE/PERMANENT tiers.** No file is under-elevated. The canon has a one-directional inflation problem.

---

## B. Intelligence Decomposition Proposal

The Intelligence chain currently holds four distinct content types that share a number prefix but not a function:

| Content Type | Files | Volatility | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SUBSTRATE** | 30100 (ASA), 30400–30440 | STABLE–MODERATE | Foundational AI theory — what agents ARE |
| **REFERENCE** | 30000 (root), 30320 (Workflow Intel) | STABLE | Domain knowledge distilled as first principles |
| **OPERATIONS** | 30300, 30310, 30330, 30340, 30450, 30460 | MODERATE–DYNAMIC | How THIS system configures and deploys AI |
| **STRATEGIC** | 30200 (Positioning) | DYNAMIC | Market intelligence and competitive positioning |

### Option 1: Intelligence Becomes Lattice Substrate

**Concept:** Reclassify Intelligence as a lattice-tier component — the "medium" through which all chains operate, just as the Palace defines dimensional geometry. The 25xxx cluster (Memory Arch, Context Trans, Constellation Arch, Ascertescence) already functions this way. Intelligence's theoretical foundations (30100, 30400–30440) would join the lattice as the substrate knowledge layer. Its operational files would migrate to a new "Operations" container. Its strategic file would migrate to Expertise.

**Structure:**
```
20000 Palace          ← dimensional geometry (existing)
25000 Memory Arch     ← persistence substrate (existing)
26000 Intelligence    ← AI substrate knowledge (NEW: renamed, renumbered)
  26100 ASA           ← human-AI integration theory
  26200 Agentic Arch  ← agent architecture survey
  26210–26250         ← CoALA, multi-agent, memory, safety, frameworks
```
Operational files (30300, 30310, 30330, 30340, 30450, 30460) → new Operations container.
Strategic file (30200) → Expertise chain or standalone strategic intelligence container.

**Trade-offs:**
- (+) Resolves the dual-ontology contradiction — Intelligence stops claiming to be both peer and substrate; it becomes substrate.
- (+) The 5 remaining chains form a clean OODA loop without a category-mismatch sixth member.
- (+) Accommodates growth — new AI theory files slot into the lattice naturally.
- (−) Breaks the "six chains" count that's wired everywhere (Corpus, Schema, Chain Matrix, Facets).
- (−) Requires updating the Facets model (five faces, not six) or acknowledging Intelligence was never a "face."
- (−) The 30400–30440 cluster (created in a single day, never updated, zero outbound connections) may not deserve lattice elevation — it may simply be reference material that hasn't earned its place yet.

### Option 2: Intelligence Stays a Chain, With Formalized Sub-Domains

**Concept:** Keep six chains, but give Intelligence explicit sub-domains with different volatility expectations. Intelligence becomes the only chain with a formalized internal tier structure, reflecting its unique status as both practice-area and enabling substrate.

**Structure:**
```
30000 Intelligence (chain root — developmental framework stays)
  30A00 Substrate Theory    ← ASA, Agentic Arch, CoALA, etc. (STABLE)
  30B00 Operational Config  ← Tech Stack, Migration, Patterns, Frameworks, Dynamics (MODERATE–DYNAMIC)
  30C00 Strategic Intel     ← Positioning, Research Protocols (MODERATE–DYNAMIC)
```

**Trade-offs:**
- (+) Preserves six-chain doctrine — no constitutional surgery.
- (+) Explicitly acknowledges the volatility gradient within Intelligence.
- (+) Operational files get a clear container with appropriate review cadence.
- (−) Intelligence remains the odd chain out — a peer that's also a substrate. The contradiction is managed, not resolved.
- (−) Sub-domains create a precedent other chains don't need, making Intelligence structurally exceptional.
- (−) Doesn't solve the OODA mapping problem — Intelligence doesn't cleanly map to one OODA phase.

### Option 3: Dissolve Intelligence; Distribute Its Content

**Concept:** Intelligence was never a developmental chain — it was a holding pen. Dissolve it entirely. Its content migrates to where it functionally belongs:

**Distribution:**
- **30100 ASA, 30400–30440** → Lattice tier as substrate knowledge (alongside Palace, Memory Arch)
- **30300, 30310** → New "Reference" or "Registry" container (high-volatility operational data)
- **30320, 30330, 30340** → Information chain (these are about how to research and implement — information-processing methodology)
- **30450** → Archive (dated snapshot, not living doctrine)
- **30460** → Operations container (it describes THIS system's interaction patterns)
- **30200** → Expertise chain (competitive positioning is strategic decision-making)

**Trade-offs:**
- (+) Most honest — Intelligence's content genuinely doesn't belong in one bucket.
- (+) Each file lands where its volatility matches the container's expectations.
- (+) Five chains form a perfect OODA loop.
- (−) Most disruptive — requires renumbering, cross-reference rewiring, and constitutional amendment.
- (−) "Five chains" breaks the hexagonal symmetry and the Fire/Water/Earth/Air/Quintessence overlay (which needs six).
- (−) Loses the explicit acknowledgment that AI tool mastery is a developmental domain. The Sovereign practices Intelligence cultivation as an activity — dissolving the chain makes this invisible.

### Recommendation

**Option 2 is the pragmatic choice; Option 1 is the architecturally correct one.**

Option 2 preserves doctrine while making the problem manageable. Option 1 resolves the contradiction cleanly but requires constitutional surgery. Option 3 is intellectually honest but too destructive — it loses the developmental dimension of Intelligence, which the Sovereign genuinely practices.

The key question for the Sovereign: **Is Intelligence a thing you develop, or a medium you develop through?** If the former, Option 2. If the latter, Option 1. If somehow both — Option 2 now, with a long-term migration path toward Option 1 as the lattice matures.

---

## C. Formalized Celestial Schema

### The Problem

The current scheme conflates three axes on one numbering system:
1. **Volatility** (how often content changes)
2. **Abstraction** (how conceptual vs. concrete)
3. **Topic** (what domain the content addresses)

These three axes are correlated but not identical. The celestial metaphor should encode **one axis only** — volatility — and let the other two be carried by chain membership (topic) and document type (abstraction).

### Revised Tier Taxonomy

| Tier | Celestial Type | Volatility Band | Structural Role | Promotion/Demotion Rules |
|------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **Cosmos** (00000) | Fixed stars | PERMANENT (5+ yr) | Constitutional bedrock — identity, principles, origin, governance | Promote: content stable across 3+ years with zero required updates. Demote: never (amend in place or supersede with new cosmos doc). |
| **Core** (10000) | Central star | PERMANENT (5+ yr) | Practitioner identity — the "who" that all chains serve | Same as cosmos. Distinct because it's about the practitioner, not the system. |
| **Lattice** (20000) | Space-time geometry | STABLE (2–5 yr) | Coordinate systems and structural substrates — the geometry chains move through | Promote: framework validated across 2+ ascertescence cycles. Demote: if framework is superseded by revised geometry. |
| **Chain** (30000–35000) | Orbital bodies | STABLE–MODERATE (1–5 yr) | Developmental domains — what the practitioner cultivates | Chain roots are STABLE (stage models). Planetary/ring bodies are STABLE (domain architecture). Volatility increases with depth. |
| **Planetary/Ring** (x1000) | Major planets, rings | STABLE (2–5 yr) | Primary elaboration of a chain's core domain | Promote: from lunar when content crystallizes into a stable domain definition. |
| **Lunar** (xx100–xx200) | Moons | MODERATE (1–2 yr) | Methodology and applied frameworks within a domain | Promote: from comet/asteroid when methodology is validated in practice. Demote: to archive when superseded. |
| **Comet** (named) | Periodic visitors | MODERATE–DYNAMIC (6mo–2yr) | Cross-cutting content that sweeps through a chain's territory but isn't bound to it | Comets are inherently transient. Review on each orbital pass (defined cadence). Promote to lunar if they stabilize. |
| **Asteroid** (named) | Small bodies | DYNAMIC (< 1 yr) | Reference material, inventories, snapshots, implementation details | Explicit review cadence in frontmatter (quarterly). Promote to lunar only if the content transcends its dated origins. Archive when superseded. |
| **Archive** (99000) | Cold storage | PERMANENT (historical) | What happened, what was superseded | Promote: never (archive is a destination). Content enters archive when superseded by a living document. |

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Volatility is the SOLE axis.** Cosmos = most evergreen. Asteroids = most dynamic. Smaller objects orbit faster — this is the ONE metaphor. Topic is carried by chain membership. Abstraction is carried by depth (root → planetary → lunar → satellite).

**2. Celestial types carry semantic meaning.** A "comet" is always cross-cutting content with a defined return cadence. An "asteroid" is always high-volatility reference material. A "lunar" is always validated methodology. You can predict what a celestial type contains from knowing other instances of that type.

**3. The lattice is geometry, not a chain.** Palace, Chain Matrix, Interference, Tri-Helix, Memory Architecture — these define the space. Chains are matter moving through it. Operational specifications (25xxx) that are currently lattice-tier but DYNAMIC should be reclassified as asteroids or comets orbiting the lattice, not lattice components themselves.

**4. Mixed-volatility documents must be split or flagged.** When a STABLE framework embeds DYNAMIC data (e.g., Chain Matrix with tech maturity percentages, Memory Arch with Graphiti version numbers), the document either needs a `volatile_sections` frontmatter field or the dynamic content should be extracted into an asteroid child. The framework stays at its natural tier; the data orbits below it.

### Reclassification Candidates

Based on the volatility audit, these files should move tiers under the new schema:

| File | Current Tier | Proposed Tier | Reason |
|------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| 00004 Evolution | cosmos | archive | Living history — it accrues, but it's retrospective |
| 00006 Corpus | cosmos | asteroid (cosmos-orbiting) | Manifest is inherently dynamic |
| 00014 Content Protocol | cosmos | lunar (Information) | Platform-specific tactics, not constitutional |
| 25200 Constellation Arch | lattice | comet (lattice-orbiting) | Costs and platform specs are transient |
| 25610 Diviner Formula | lattice | comet (lattice-orbiting) | Tied to specific model version |
| 30200 Positioning | comet | asteroid | Corporate profiles are quarterly-volatile |
| 30300 Tech Stack | comet | asteroid | 447-app inventory is inherently dynamic |
| 30450 Production Frameworks | asteroid | asteroid (correctly tiered but needs archive date) | Already past its "Upcoming" dates |
| 31115 IIC Impl | lunar | asteroid | Daily tactical guide |
| 31141 Five Account | satellite | asteroid | Per-platform automation configs |
| 31142 Platform Grammar | satellite | asteroid | Pure tactical protocols |
| 31150 Platform Catalog | (untyped) | asteroid | Self-declared auto-generated temporal data |
| 34120 Syllabus | lunar | asteroid | Explicitly dated "October 2025" snapshot |

## D. The OODA-Element Rosetta

### The Mapping

| OODA Phase | Chain Name | Element | Developmental Function | Facet (ModusOperandi) | Palace Layer Affinity | What It Cultivates |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Observe** (Sensing) | Information | Air | Perceiving the environment — gathering signal, curating feeds, recognizing patterns | Sensing | Reality, Imaginality | Perceptual sophistication: from pattern recognition to embodied knowing |
| **Orient** (Meaning-Making) | Insight | Water | Interpreting what was sensed — hermeneutic depth, coherence, synthesis | Meaning-Making | Potentiality, Temporality | Interpretive capacity: from ontological foundations to wisdom emergence |
| **Decide** (Decision-Formation) | Expertise | Fire | Forming intention — strategic choice, economic capability, volitional capacity | Intention-Formation | Practicality | Volitional precision: from abstract planning to transcendent contribution |
| **Act** (Embodiment) | Knowledge | Earth | Executing in the world — skill crystallization, curriculum mastery, teaching | Embodiment | Actuality, Consequentiality | Embodied competence: from conceptual learning to mastery teaching |
| **Sharpen** (Meta-Loop) | Wisdom | Quintessence | Meta-cognition — reflecting on the loop itself, transcendence, neurodivergent integration | Strategic Harmony | (all layers) | Meta-cognitive integration: from value discernment to transcendent wisdom |
| **???** | Intelligence | ??? | *(See decomposition proposal — this is the unresolved sixth)* | *(See below)* | *(See below)* | AI tool mastery: from text interface to full integration |

### The Intelligence Problem in the Rosetta

Intelligence doesn't map to an OODA phase. It IS the medium through which modern OODA loops execute. Consider:

- You **Observe** (Information) using AI sensing tools
- You **Orient** (Insight) using AI synthesis
- You **Decide** (Expertise) using AI analysis
- You **Act** (Knowledge) using AI execution
- You **Sharpen** (Wisdom) using AI reflection

Intelligence is the **substrate enabling each phase**, not a phase itself. This is why the Rosetta has a gap — the celestial metaphor forced a substrate concern into a peer position.

**If Intelligence becomes lattice** (Option 1 from Section B): the Rosetta resolves cleanly as a 5-chain OODA loop with Intelligence as the medium. The elemental overlay becomes Air/Water/Fire/Earth/Quintessence with no orphan element.

**If Intelligence stays a chain** (Option 2): the Rosetta must acknowledge a sixth row that doesn't map to OODA but instead maps to "the capacity to use the loop's instruments." This is defensible — "Sharpen the Saw" (Wisdom) is also not strictly OODA, so there's precedent for non-phase chains. Intelligence would be "Sharpen the Tools" — developing the instruments through which all other phases execute.

### The Element Overlay

| Element | Chain | Quality | Cultural Resonance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Air** | Information | Atmospheric, pervasive, carries signal | Airbender: perception, freedom, flow |
| **Water** | Insight | Fluid, depth-seeking, shape-shifting | Waterbender: adaptability, healing, transformation |
| **Fire** | Expertise | Directed, volitional, transformative | Firebender: drive, creation, directed force |
| **Earth** | Knowledge | Solid, embodied, structural | Earthbender: stability, endurance, material mastery |
| **Quintessence** | Wisdom | Transcendent, all-pervading, meta | The Avatar state: integration of all elements |
| *(Void/Aether?)* | Intelligence | *(Medium, substrate, the space elements move through)* | *(The Spirit World — the invisible dimension enabling bending itself)* |

If Intelligence becomes lattice substrate, the sixth element question dissolves — you have five elements for five chains, which is the natural number. If Intelligence stays, the sixth element should be explicitly **Void** or **Aether** — the space-between that enables the other five. In the Avatar metaphor, this maps to the Spirit World: not a bending discipline, but the dimension that makes bending possible.

### Reading the Rosetta

Any agent can now derive all three encodings from one row:
- **OODA tells you the cognitive function** — what phase of the loop this chain serves
- **Element tells you the qualitative character** — how this chain "feels" in practice
- **Facet tells you the subjective mode** — which face of consciousness is active
- **Palace affinity tells you the dimensional home** — which layers of experience this chain primarily operates in
- **Developmental function tells you the growth arc** — what mastery in this chain looks like

## Summary of Schema Decisions for Sovereign Review

1. **Volatility as sole tier axis** — confirmed as the correct formalization of the celestial metaphor. Smaller objects orbit faster = higher volatility.

2. **Celestial types with semantic meaning** — cosmos (constitutional), core (identity), lattice (geometry), chain/planetary/ring (developmental), lunar (methodology), comet (cross-cutting periodic), asteroid (high-volatility reference), archive (cold storage).

3. **22 files are volatility-misplaced** — all in the same direction (over-elevated). The IIC sub-tree and Intelligence operations cluster are the worst offenders.

4. **Intelligence decomposition** — three options presented. Recommendation: Option 2 (formalized sub-domains) for stability; Option 1 (lattice promotion) for architectural correctness. Sovereign decides which value wins.

5. **The OODA-Element Rosetta** — five clean mappings plus the unresolved sixth. The Rosetta itself is evidence that Intelligence is substrate, not peer. But the Sovereign may have reasons to keep it as a developmental chain that the schema alone can't capture.
