# Canon Remediation — Pass 5: The Cosmological Schema

**Sovereign → Commander (Claude Opus 4.6)**
**Context: CC42 Canon Sensing complete. Concurrent scaffold decruft underway in parallel session.**

---

## Standing Context

The canon is the CLAUDE.md of the Syncrescendence — programmable scripture for an AI-native life practice. The celestial metaphor encodes volatility (evergreenness = orbital distance), not prestige. The six chains decompose a cognitive OODA loop (Information=Sensing, Insight=Meaning-Making, Expertise=Decision-Formation, Knowledge=Embodiment) plus Wisdom as meta-loop ("sharpen the saw"). Elemental overlays (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Quintessence) are a branding/resonance layer for eventual public communication, inspired by Avatar: The Last Airbender — primordial framings carrying cultural meaning, malleable enough to hold deeper significance.

The lattice tier (20000-25000) IS the space-time geometry in which chains orbit. The chains are matter moving through it.

The canon was originally taste-gated — every sentence curated by the Sovereign. Agentification introduced material without that gate, and the Intelligence chain in particular metastasized because it was the only container for the exploding AI landscape. The result: a canon that's part scripture, part reference library, part operational manual — three genres on one shelf. The backlog this created is not a boil to lance — it's treasure. The accumulated information is a floor to build on, not debt to retire. The issue was throughput, and the throughput bottleneck was cruft — not the content itself, but the organizational incoherence that made content unreachable.

Concurrent with this canon remediation, there is a parallel effort decrusting the scaffold (the repo's engine/orchestration infrastructure). Canon here, scaffold there, exocortex next. Each layer scaffolds the next: canon (source) → scaffold (compiler) → exocortex (runtime).

The Sovereign's ultimate vision: a normalized knowledge base where each principle exists once and projects into multiple views — scripture (narrative prose), config (machine-parseable), graph (Obsidian topology), ledger (live-updating state), compiled (Syncrescript for context windows). Making the cosmology coherent is prerequisite for the graph view to be meaningful.

**Open questions with directionality (NOT ratified — these are hypotheses for you to stress-test, not conclusions to adopt):**
- Intelligence has strong directionality toward being reclassified as substrate rather than peer chain — but this is an open design question. Explore it, propose options, don't assume the answer.
- The sensing passes proposed a 6-category reorganization (Constitution, Architecture, Practice, Operations, Reference, Archive) — this is one candidate structure, not the ordained one. You may confirm it, revise it, or propose alternatives.

## Objective

Reconcile the celestial metaphor with the actual content structure. Don't destroy the metaphor — formalize it as a schema.

## Instructions

Read every file in `~/Desktop/canon/` (yes, all 86 again). You have the unified sensing report at `~/Desktop/CANON-SENSING-UNIFIED.md` — read that first for orientation. You also have the Sovereign's design intent:

1. **The celestial tiers encode volatility/shelf-life.** Cosmos = most evergreen. Asteroids = most dynamic. Smaller objects orbit faster. This is the ONE axis the tiers should measure. Currently they conflate volatility with topic, which is why mid-level navigation breaks.

2. **The six chains are a decomposed OODA loop**, not arbitrary taxonomy. The original mapping: Sensing (Acumen/Information) → Meaning-Making (Coherence/Insight) → Decision-Formation (Efficacy/Expertise) → Embodiment (Mastery/Knowledge). Wisdom = sharpen the saw. The elemental overlay is a second encoding, not a competitor.

3. **Intelligence is the substrate problem.** It holds four different concerns (reference, operations, strategy, substrate knowledge) crammed into one chain because no other container could hold hierarchical AI content. Intelligence is adopted less and less further down the OODA loop — it's less "chain" and more "medium." The Sovereign has explicitly asked for your input on how to decompose it. This is an OPEN QUESTION — propose multiple options with trade-offs.

4. **The lattice IS space-time**, not a navigation aid. The Palace, Chain Matrix, Interference, Tri-Helix, Memory Architecture — these define the geometry. Chains are matter moving through the geometry.

## Your Task

**A. Volatility Audit.** For every file in canon, assess its actual volatility: how often would this content need updating to remain accurate? Produce a spectrum from "effectively permanent" (principles, origin story) to "quarterly refresh" (tool inventories, cost figures, platform catalogs). Map the current celestial tier against the assessed volatility. Flag every file where the tier doesn't match the volatility — these are the misplacements the metaphor needs to correct.

**B. Intelligence Decomposition Proposal.** The Intelligence chain (30000 + all 30xxx files) currently holds reference knowledge, operational config, strategic evaluation, and theoretical foundations. Propose at least two decomposition options with trade-offs. Consider: should Intelligence become a lattice-tier substrate (like the Palace)? Should its sub-concerns become their own celestial types? Should some files migrate to other chains? Should it remain a chain but with formalized sub-domains? Remember the Sovereign's expanding scope: CLI tools, backend, enterprise SaaS, hardware, fine-tuning, open models — this is not shrinking. The decomposition must accommodate growth.

**C. Formalized Celestial Schema.** Produce a revised tier taxonomy where each tier has:
- A clear volatility band (e.g., "cosmos = content expected to hold for 5+ years")
- A clear structural role (e.g., "lattice = defines the coordinate geometry for lower tiers")
- Named celestial types that carry consistent semantic meaning (not just nesting depth)
- Rules for when content should be promoted/demoted between tiers

**D. The OODA-Element Rosetta.** Produce the explicit mapping between the OODA decomposition, the chain names, the elemental overlays, and the developmental function of each chain. This mapping should be a single table that any agent can read to understand all three encodings simultaneously. Currently this mapping exists only in the Sovereign's head.

Do NOT propose renumbering yet — that's Pass 7. Focus on the conceptual schema.
