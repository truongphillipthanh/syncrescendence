What surprised most was the dominance of meta-tracking and extraction layers over raw sources, revealing a system optimized for processing rather than mere storage, with metadata nearly equaling content in volume. The ratio of living signal to dead weight leans toward 75:25, as dynamic states, agents, and scripts pulse with activity while some archival sources gather dust without recent triangulation. The single weirdest file encountered was ENGINE-FUNC-absorb.xml, a labyrinthine XML protocol mandating crystalline insight compression through five-phase differential scanning, evoking a ritualistic algorithm for intellectual alchemy that borders on esoteric engineering.
