## Structural Decisions

### D-1/D-2: Intelligence Decomposition — RATIFIED (Option 1 + Diviner Amendment)
Intelligence becomes lattice substrate BUT retains explicit developmental tracking. It is not a passive kernel — it is an active extracellular matrix that modulates the five chains. Frontmatter gains `layer: lattice` for substrate files. The 304xx cluster migrates to lattice. A `developmental_status` field prevents cognitive atrophy — lattice files are still actively cultivated, not treated as invisible infrastructure.

### D-3: Celestial Schema — RATIFIED
Volatility as sole axis. High-volatility tiers (Asteroid/Comet) are structurally recognized as the locus of system vitality — stem cells, not debris. Equal ontological weight to permanent bedrock.

### D-4: 6-Category Structure — RATIFIED
Constitution / Architecture / Practice / Operations / Reference / Archive.

### D-5: Numbering — RATIFIED (Option B)
Keep 5-digit IDs. S-1 frontmatter is the contract; filenames are human-readable keys.

## Taste-Gating Decisions

### T-1: Neologisms — DEFERRED
Deferred to sovereign taste-gating pass. No agent decides naming.

### T-2: Demotions — RATIFIED
30410-30450 textbook imports, 34120, 31150, 33111, 30450 — demoted to corpus with `demoted_from_canon` flag.

### T-3: Reclassifications — RATIFIED
22 yellow + 10 red heatmap moves per Pass 6.

### T-4: Promotion Policy — RATIFIED
S-1 frontmatter is the gate. No file enters canon without compliant frontmatter.

### T-5: Archive Policy — RATIFIED
Files exceeding `refresh_cadence` without update trigger staleness alert, not auto-archive. Sovereign taste-gates the final call.

### T-6: Immune System — RATIFIED (Diviner Reframe)
The immune system is NOT a central hub at 00011 — it IS the S-1 frontmatter (MHC) + compiler validation (circulating antibodies). 00011 becomes the immune system's documentation, not its mechanism. The compiler enforces coherence across the entire graph at build time.

## Syncrescript Decisions

### V-1: Compression Targets — RATIFIED
3.0x average, minimum 2.0x per file. Declared loss manifest in header.

### V-2: Compiler Architecture — RATIFIED
5-stage pipeline (Parse → Validate → Graph → Compress → Emit). Validation IS the immune system.

### V-3: View Priority — RATIFIED
Scripture (human) and Config (agent) views first. Graph, Ledger, Compiled views follow.

### V-4: Formal Grammar — DEFERRED
Defer until v2 proof-of-concept validates the 7 design principles on 10 files.

### V-5: Round-Trip Fidelity — RATIFIED
Structural data (frontmatter, edges, thresholds) = lossless. Prose = lossy by design.

## Novel Addition

### M-1: Mutagenic Zone — RATIFIED
A designated space in corpus routing where semantic validation is suspended. Experimental cross-pollination, paradigm-breaking synthesis, and half-formed insights live here without triggering compile errors. The compiler enforces syntax only. This is where being wrong is structurally permissible in service of becoming right.

## Critical Path (Execution Order)

```
S-1 frontmatter standard ──► D-1 lattice migration ──► T-2/T-3 demotions + reclassifications
                          │
                          ├──► T-6 compiler-as-immune-system
                          │
                          └──► V-2 compiler stages 1-2 (Parse + Validate)
```

S-1 is the keystone. Everything else is downstream.
