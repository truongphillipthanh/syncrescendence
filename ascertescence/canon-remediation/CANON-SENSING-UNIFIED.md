# Canon Sensing — Unified Report

**Commander (Claude Opus 4.6) | 86 files examined across 4 passes | CC42**

---

## I. WHAT'S IN THE VAULT

The canon directory contains **86 files** (84 CANON-prefixed + 2 non-prefixed) plus a `sn/` subdirectory holding 85 compressed SN-notation copies and 3 unique metric/axiom files. The `sn/` directory is a derived artifact — a canonical compression of canon that belongs *with* the vault but not *in* it.

### Doctrinal Consensus
The vault is doctrinally coherent. Every file that references a core count agrees:
- **6 chains**: Intelligence, Information, Insight, Expertise, Knowledge, Wisdom — unanimous
- **7 Palace layers**: Reality → Imaginality → Potentiality → Temporality → Practicality → Actuality → Consequentiality — unanimous
- **4 Modals**: Abstraction (2024-2027), Simulation (2027-2030), Embodiment (2031-2036), Transcendence (2037+) — unanimous
- **Apoptosis vs retirement scopes**: explicitly and correctly differentiated in both protocol files — no conflation found

### One Structural Tension — Unresolved
Intelligence (CANON-30000) explicitly claims dual ontological status: simultaneously a peer chain AND the substrate enabling all others. Line 115: "Technology Stage 1 = universal prerequisite for ANY other chain Stage 2 advancement." But it is architecturally wired as a peer — same structural parent (00000 via 21000), same position (30000 alongside 31000-35000). The doctrine says substrate; the graph says peer. The system says one thing and does another.

---

## II. THE NATURAL STRUCTURE

The content organizes into **six functional categories** that cut across the celestial numbering scheme. These are corrected from the initial nine-cluster analysis after verification.

### 1. CONSTITUTION (11 files)
*What governs the system — identity, principles, rules, self-assessment, lifecycle.*

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| 00000 Schema | Navigational map of the document system |
| 00001 Origin | Founding "why" — convergence crisis, Fourth Turning response |
| 00002 Lineage | Intellectual genealogy — Clark & Chalmers, Hofstadter, Vervaeke, Kegan |
| 00003 Principles | 30 compressed aphorisms governing everything |
| 00005 Syncrescendence | The "originary scripture" — enough to regenerate the rest |
| 00006 Corpus | Registry and manifest of all canon documents |
| 00007 Evaluation | Brutally honest self-assessment and falsification criteria |
| 00011 Artifact Protocol | Governance for creating and promoting documents |
| 00017 Agentic Constitution | Federalist governance for the multi-agent apparatus |
| apoptosis_protocol | 5:1 axiom pruning — for every 5 atoms condensed, 1 existing axiom evaluated |
| retirement_protocol | 2:1 tool retirement — retire 2 old capabilities before activating 1 new |

The death protocols (apoptosis, retirement) and the Ontology Gates (v1, v2) are constitutional in *content* but infrastructure-grade in *packaging*. They enforce rules on a graph they aren't structurally part of — the body doesn't know its immune system exists. The retirement protocol's explicit exemption of cognitive instruments from the 2:1 ratio reveals a hidden value judgment: thinking modes are categorically different from tools.

### 2. ARCHITECTURE (10 files)
*How the mind and practice are structurally modeled — coordinate systems, the Palace, the developmental lattice.*

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| 00016 Ontological Framework | Coordinate system for mapping all human experience — theory of the map |
| 10000 Celestial Body | The practitioner as hypergiant star, Seven Pulses assessment |
| 11000 Facets | Five faces of unified consciousness (perichoresis model) |
| 20000 Palace | Seven-layer Cognitive Palace — operational substrate for practice |
| 20010 Dim Coordinators | Seven orchestrating intelligences, one per Palace layer |
| 20020 Meta-Systems | Four infrastructure systems enabling Palace components |
| 21000 Chain Matrix | Dependency map between six causal chains |
| 21100 Tri-Helix | Three-timeline synchronization — tech maturity × business × personal capability |
| 22000 Interference | Wave-physics of chain constructive/destructive interaction |
| 24000 Omni-Quality | Four theological attributes as cross-cutting development targets |

CANON-00016 (Ontological Framework) is correctly cosmos-tier — it defines the *theory of the map*, not a specific map. It does not duplicate the Palace; they operate at genuinely different levels of abstraction. The Tri-Helix is a *structural coordination mechanism*, not "pure business strategy" — business is one of three helices it synchronizes.

### 3. PRACTICE (23 files)
*The six developmental chains and their elaborations — what the practitioner actually develops.*

**Practitioner navigation:**
- 00009 Strategy — Six Canonical Dimensions, Phase-Appropriate Engagement
- 00010 Operations — Seven Pulses, Energy States, Burnout Prevention, daily rhythms
- 00012 Modal Sequence — four technology-aligned strategic phases (2024-2037+)
- 00013 Quickstart — onboarding, three entry pathways
- 00014 Content Protocol — Three-Rail system, production pipelines
- 00015 Macroscopic Narratives — ~40 civilizational interpretive lenses
- 23000 Lunar Nav — five-dimension navigation for Insight and Wisdom chains

**Six chain roots** (30000-35000) with their planetary/lunar/satellite elaborations:

| Chain | Root | Planet/Ring | Leaves | Total |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Intelligence | 30000 | — | (moved to Reference/Operations) | 1 |
| Information | 31000 | 31100 Acumen | 31110-31143 (8 files) | 10 |
| Insight | 32000 | 32100 Coherence | 32110, 32120 | 4 |
| Expertise | 33000 | 33100 Efficacy | 33110-33112 | 5 |
| Knowledge | 34000 | 34100 Mastery | 34110, 34120 | 4 |
| Wisdom | 35000 | 35100 Transcendence (ring) | 35110-35210 (5 files) | 7 |

**Notable content findings:**
- The IIC constellation (31140-31143) is an *identity architecture* masquerading as content strategy — five email identities each embodying a developmental chain, with handoff protocols. This is a theory of distributed selfhood.
- The Neurodivergent documents (35120/35121) argue AuDHD experience *reveals universal truths* about cognition that neurotypical experience masks. The "broken fuel gauge" and "sensory seesaw" are the general condition made visible.
- The Gaian Node (35200) is a *physical construction blueprint* — energy, food, water systems — the only file describing concrete atoms and soil. It references 20 files across 5 chains despite being a third-tier "lunar." It's wired like a root, positioned like a leaf.
- CANON-31100 (Acumen) has the highest fan-out of any non-root node: 8 direct children and 20+ outbound references including cross-chain links.

### 4. OPERATIONS (8 files)
*How the AI constellation actually runs — memory, sessions, platforms, prompting formulas.*

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| 25000 Memory Arch | Seven memory strata, sovereignty principle |
| 25100 Context Trans | Unified session management protocol |
| 25200 Constellation Arch | Multi-platform AI specification |
| 25500 Architecture Rationale | 22-session forensic reconstruction, INT-2210 catastrophe |
| 25600 Ascertescence Cycle | Six-phase operational cycle (Rendezvous → Remediation) |
| 25610 Diviner Prompting Formula | Eight structural elements for Gemini synthesis |
| 30460 Interaction Dynamics | Cross-platform routing state machines |
| 31150 Platform Capability Catalog | Auto-generated inventory of live platform constellation |

These are specifications for THIS system — not general AI knowledge.

### 5. REFERENCE (14 files)
*Domain knowledge canonized as substrate — AI architecture, safety, frameworks, tools, methodology.*

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| 30100 ASA | Anthromachina Symbiosis Architecture (general human-AI framework) |
| 30200 Positioning | Platform/company intelligence profiles |
| 30300 Tech Stack | Database spec for 447 apps, 42 models, 31 APIs |
| 30310 Migration | CSV-to-schema migration protocol |
| 30320 Workflow Intel | How tools organize into workflows |
| 30330 Research Protocols | Source Triad Method, Verdicting Process |
| 30340 Implementation Patterns | Over-Engineering Anti-Pattern, memory bootstrapping |
| 30400 Agentic Architecture | Comprehensive agentic AI survey (Dec 2025) |
| 30410 Cognitive Architecture | CoALA framework deep spec |
| 30420 Multi-Agent Orchestration | Orchestration patterns implementation guide |
| 30430 Memory Systems | AI agent memory technical reference |
| 30440 Safety Alignment | Threat/defense specification |
| 30450 Production Frameworks | Framework comparison (LangGraph, OpenAI, etc.) |
| 34120 Syllabus | Tool recommendations per stage — frozen Jan 2026 snapshot |

Neither CANON-30400 nor CANON-30100 references the actual constellation agents (Ajna, Psyche, Commander, Adjudicator, Cartographer) or AGENTS.md. They serve the system as substrate knowledge, not as internal architecture docs. The 304xx cluster (30410-30450) was created in a single day (2025-12-30), never updated, all `theoretical` or `partial` status, zero outbound connections beyond parent — five textbook chapters that entered canon as reference material.

The Syllabus (34120) is the most perishable file in the entire vault — explicitly time-bound with a 6-12 month refresh cadence, in tension with the "immutable verified knowledge" framing of canon.

### 6. ARCHIVE (4 files + sn/)
*What happened, what was superseded, compressed backups.*

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| 00004 Evolution | Eight Oracle sessions, Metabolic Defrag, Kintsugi principle |
| 99000 Historical | Complete evolution archive, migration paths |
| Ontology Gate v1 | Runtime contract for canon promotion — no YAML frontmatter |
| Ontology Gate v2 | Constitutional extension adding lattice annealer integration — no YAML frontmatter |
| sn/ directory | 85 SN-compressed copies + 3 unique metric/axiom files |

The Ontology Gates live here provisionally — they're runtime contracts that *govern* canon but lack the packaging to be *part of* it. Once given proper frontmatter, they should move to Constitution.

---

## III. THE TOPOLOGY

### Shape
A spine with ribs, where the ribs are internally tangled. The intended structure is a tree. The actual structure is a DAG with ~40+ 2-cycles (sibling mutual references) and ~10 parent-child cycles. If you remove sibling-awareness links, it becomes a clean tree. The cycles are convention, not content.

### Hubs (most-referenced)

| Rank | File | Role |
|------|------|------|
| 1 | **CANON-00000** (Schema) | Universal root — referenced by ~65+ files |
| 2 | **CANON-00006** (Corpus) | The manifest — in cross-references of virtually every chain file |
| 3 | **CANON-30000** (Intelligence) | Functional second root — referenced across all chain cross-reference sections |
| 4 | **CANON-00005** (Syncrescendence) | The originary scripture — cosmos-tier and chain roots reference it |
| 5 | **CANON-21000** (Chain Matrix) | Formal dependency wiring hub — all chain roots list it in depends_on |
| 6 | **CANON-00010** (Operations) | Practitioner operations — chain roots and planetary files reference it |
| 7 | **CANON-20000** (Palace) | Lattice siblings depend on it |
| 8 | **CANON-31100** (Acumen) | Most-referenced planetary body — entire IIC sub-tree depends on it |

### Islands (no inbound references)

| File | Status |
|------|--------|
| CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v1 | True island — zero canon connections except from v2 |
| CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v2 | True island — nothing points to it |
| retirement_protocol | True island — zero connections in either direction |
| apoptosis_protocol | Half-island — points into canon (00011, 00007) but nothing points back |
| CANON-25610 (Diviner Formula) | Leaf — nothing depends on knowing the formula |
| CANON-31115 (IIC Impl) | Leaf — orphaned from hierarchy, no inbound references |
| CANON-99000 (Historical) | Archive island — points in, nothing points back |

The immune system (Gates + death protocols) is topologically severed from the body it protects. No canon file references any of them. If deleted, no `depends_on` field would break.

### Dependency Chain Structure
```
Primary Spine:
00000 → 00001 → 00002 → 00003 → 00004
00000 → 00005 → 00009 → 00012
00005 + 00009 + 00010 → 00013

Lattice:
00000 → 20000 → {20010, 20020}
20000 → 21000 → 21100
20000 → {22000, 23000, 24000} (mutually entangled)
20000 → 25000 → 25100 → 25200 ... 25600 → 25610
         (gap at 25500 — no frontmatter, no declared depends_on)

Intelligence:
30000 → 30100, 30200
30000 → 30300 → {30310, 30320, 30330, 30340}
30000 → 30400 → {30410, 30420, 30430, 30440, 30450}
30000 → 30460 (oddly depends on 30400's children, not 30400 itself)

Information (widest tree — 8 children from Acumen):
31000 → 31100 → 31110 → 31115
           → 31120 → {31121, 31122}
           → 31130
           → 31140 → {31141, 31142, 31143}
           → 31150

Other chains: similar but narrower structures
```

### `depends_on` is Overloaded
The field serves three incompatible purposes simultaneously:
1. **True prerequisite**: "read X before this makes sense"
2. **Sibling awareness**: "these are my peers"
3. **Synthesis dependency**: parent listing children it draws upon (legitimate for synthesis documents like Acumen, but breaks topological sorting)

This makes the field unreliable for automated dependency resolution.

### Broken Link
CANON-00007 (Evaluation) at line 854 contains `[[CANON-00008-RESOLUTIONS-cosmos]]` — a live wikilink to a file that was merged into the very document that references it (2026-02-01 lean-out). Stale self-reference.

---

## IV. THE MAINTENANCE DEBT

### Version Schizophrenia (systemic)
Nearly every file has two version numbers that disagree — YAML frontmatter was batch-updated to 2.0.0 during a migration; body inline headers were never touched:

| File | YAML | Body |
|------|------|------|
| CANON-00000 | 2.0.0 | 2.3 |
| CANON-00005 | 2.0.0 | 2.3 |
| CANON-00007 | 3.0.0 | 2.3 |
| CANON-00014 | 2.0.0 | 1.0 |
| CANON-10000 | 2.0.0 | 1.1.0 |
| CANON-25200 | 2.0.0 | 1.0.0 |
| All chain roots | 2.0.0 | 1.0.0 |

Neither version is reliable. This is a CC31-class mass-edit artifact.

### Operational Status Landscape

| Status | Count | Significance |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **operational** | ~10 | Only these files are self-declared complete |
| **partial** | ~30+ | Dominant state — including the originary scripture (00005), Intelligence root (30000), Cognitive Palace (20000) |
| **theoretical** | ~15 | Never validated in practice |
| **pilot** | 1 | CANON-30300 only |
| **missing** | 5 | No parseable frontmatter: 25500, 31150, Ontology Gates, retirement_protocol |

More than a third of canon is self-declared incomplete.

### Stale Chain Names
Three of six chain roots have wrong H1 headings from a prior naming convention:
- CANON-33000: H1 says "EFFICACY CHAIN" → should say "EXPERTISE CHAIN"
- CANON-34000: H1 says "EMBODIMENT CHAIN" → should say "KNOWLEDGE CHAIN"
- CANON-35000: H1 says "TRANSCENDENCE CHAIN" → should say "WISDOM CHAIN"

### Status Self-Contradictions
- **CANON-31115**: YAML `status: canonical` vs body "Classification: Operational Supplement (Non-Canonical)"
- **CANON-30200**: YAML `status: canonical` vs body "Status: Beta"
- **CANON-30300**: YAML `status: canonical` vs body "Status: Beta - Schema Complete, Awaiting Data Migration"

### Temporal Impossibilities
- **CANON-25200**: `last_verified: 2026-02-05` but `updated: 2026-02-10` — modified after verification, never re-verified
- **CANON-25600**: References "CC42 canonicalization" in body — CC42 hasn't occurred yet

### Other Anomalies
- **CANON-00014**: parent conflict — YAML says `parent: CANON-00006`, body says parent is `CANON-00010`
- **CANON-30330/30340**: duplicate YAML keys (`dependencies:` AND `depends_on:`)
- **CANON-33111**: half-written — `[SECTION III TO BE WRITTEN]` placeholder, promoted to `canonical` in incomplete state
- **CANON-30460**: filename convention break — `-comet.md` without chain suffix (siblings use `-comet-INTELLIGENCE.md`)
- **CANON-31150**: `Orbital Class: Unknown` — unresolved classification for a canonicalized document

### Confirmed Contradiction: AI Constellation Cost
Three canon files disagree:
- **CANON-25200** (updated 2026-02-10): "$100/month" — 3×Claude Pro + Gemini + ChatGPT
- **CANON-31150** (regenerated 2026-02-16): "$160/month" — Claude Code Max + Claude Web Pro + ChatGPT + Google AI
- **CANON-31142** (Platform Grammar): "~$100-130/month"

CANON-25200 was updated *after* the architecture change it fails to reflect. Stale data from an update that didn't propagate.

### Corpus Manifest Stale
CANON-00006 lists 71 documents (last updated 2025-12-30). The vault now has 86 files — 15 files behind. Missing: entire 25xxx family, Intelligence chain expansion, newer satellites. Cannot be used as source of truth.

### Five Frontmatter-Free Files
CANON-25500, CANON-31150, CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v1, CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v2, retirement_protocol — invisible to any metadata-driven tooling.

---

## V. THE CELESTIAL SCHEME — VERDICT

**The scheme fights the content at mid-level, serves it at the extremes.**

### Where it works
- The six chains as organizational spines: genuine boundaries, clean separation
- The cosmos tier as constitutional layer: appropriate scope marker
- The core tier (10000, 11000) as practitioner identity: clear and distinct

### Where it fails

**1. Conflates scope and topic.** Tiers encode both "how important" (scope) and "what about" (topic) on the same axis. CANON-00016 is cosmos-scope but Palace-topic. The tier can't tell you what a file is about — only how important the system thinks it is.

**2. Celestial types carry no semantic meaning.** "Comet" vs "asteroid" vs "satellite" vs "lunar" — these map to nesting depth, nothing more. You can't predict what a "satellite" contains from knowing what other "satellites" contain.

**3. Forces single-parent hierarchy on multi-parent content.** CANON-35200 (Gaian Node) genuinely draws from 5 chains but is forced under Wisdom→Transcendence→lunar. CANON-31115 (IIC Impl) functions as a supplement to Feedcraft (31110), not a peer, but its number (31115) implies it sits between 31110 and 31120.

### The rebuilt scheme
Six top-level categories named by function: **Constitution, Architecture, Practice, Operations, Reference, Archive.** No celestial metaphors. The chain structure still works as sub-organization within Practice.

---

## VI. ACTION ITEMS

Ranked by impact on vault reliability:

1. **Fix the 5 frontmatter-free files** — add YAML frontmatter to CANON-25500, CANON-31150, Ontology Gates, retirement_protocol. Until then, they're invisible to any automated processing.

2. **Reconcile version numbers** — pick one source of truth (YAML or body) and kill the other. The dual-version state means neither can be trusted.

3. **Resolve the cost contradiction** — CANON-25200 ($100), CANON-31150 ($160), CANON-31142 ($100-130). One figure, one file of record.

4. **Update CANON-00006** — the manifest is 15 files behind. Either automate it or deprecate it as a source of truth.

5. **Fix the 3 stale chain names** — CANON-33000 H1 (Efficacy→Expertise), CANON-34000 H1 (Embodiment→Knowledge), CANON-35000 H1 (Transcendence→Wisdom).

6. **Resolve CANON-31115's identity** — is it canonical or non-canonical? Pick one. Currently contradicts itself.

7. **Demote CANON-33111** — half-written document with `[TO BE WRITTEN]` placeholder should not have `status: canonical`.

8. **Remove stale CANON-00008 wikilink** from CANON-00007 line 854 — broken reference to merged content.

9. **Move `sn/` out of `canon/`** — derived archive should be a sibling, not a child.

10. **Resolve `depends_on` semantics** — either split into `prerequisites`, `siblings`, `children` or accept that the field is "related_to" and stop treating it as a dependency graph.
