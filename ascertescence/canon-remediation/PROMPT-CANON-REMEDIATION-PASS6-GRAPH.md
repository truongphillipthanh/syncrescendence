# Canon Remediation — Pass 6: The Graph

**Sovereign → Commander (Claude Opus 4.6)**
**Context: CC42 Canon Sensing complete. Pass 5 (Schema) should be complete before running this pass.**

---

## Standing Context

Same as Pass 5 (read `~/Desktop/PROMPT-CANON-REMEDIATION-PASS5-SCHEMA.md` for full context if needed).

Additional context: The Sovereign explicitly expected a solar system visualization of the cosmology — not ASCII boxes but orbital relationships rendered graphically. This is the pass that delivers it. The cosmological coherence being established in these passes is prerequisite for the Obsidian graph view to be meaningful.

---

## Objective

Produce the Obsidian-ready cosmological graph — the solar system visualization.

## Instructions

Read the sensing report (`~/Desktop/CANON-SENSING-UNIFIED.md`) and your Pass 5 response (`~/Desktop/RESPONSE-CANON-REMEDIATION-PASS5.md`). Then:

**A. Produce a Mermaid diagram** of the entire canon as a solar system. Use whatever celestial schema Pass 5 proposed (or the current one if Pass 5's proposal needs sovereign review first — note which you're using). The diagram should show:
- The gravitational center (00000) as the star
- Cosmos-tier files in close orbit (slow, evergreen)
- Lattice-tier files as the space-time grid
- Chain roots as planets
- Planetary/lunar/satellite files in appropriate orbital positions
- Intelligence (however Pass 5 proposes to handle it) distinctly represented — if Pass 5 offered multiple options, render the option you find most compelling and note why
- Cross-chain connections (especially the hubs: 35200 Gaian Node, 31100 Acumen) as visible arcs
- The topologically severed immune system (Ontology Gates, death protocols) shown floating outside the system
- Islands and orphans visibly isolated

**B. Produce a dependency-only subgraph** showing only the `depends_on` edges (cleaned: remove sibling-awareness links and parent-child inversions). This is the "true" causal graph — what-produced-what.

**C. Produce a volatility heatmap** — the same graph but color-coded by the volatility assessment from Pass 5. Red = stale (content older than its assessed refresh cadence). Green = fresh. Yellow = approaching staleness.

**D. Identify hidden clusters.** With the graph rendered, what structural insights become visible that text-based sensing missed? Are there communities that only appear in the topology? Dead zones? Surprisingly dense neighborhoods?

The graph outputs should be in formats the Sovereign can paste directly into Obsidian or a Mermaid renderer.
