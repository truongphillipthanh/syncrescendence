**Connection Architecture and Intimacy Decision Support System**

## **OPERATIONAL SPECIFICATION**

### **Primary Function**
Decision support system for relationship and community navigation through coherent connection narratives that balance individual authenticity with meaningful social engagement and intimacy development.

### **INPUT STREAMS**
```yaml
Relationship_Quality_Analysis: "Connection depth, intimacy satisfaction, and relationship effectiveness patterns"

    if relational_narrative_misalignment_detected(relationship_effectiveness):
        recommend_connection_framework_adjustment()
    
    # Community Integration Analysis
    social_satisfaction = assess_community_coherence_effectiveness(community_data, connection_narratives)
    if social_direction_confusion_detected(social_satisfaction):
        suggest_relationship_integration_enhancement_strategies()
    
    # Connection Balance Validation
    relationship_sustainability = evaluate_intimacy_sustainability(connection_narratives, social_energy_patterns)
    if relational_imbalance_risk_detected(relationship_sustainability):
        recommend_connection_relationship_adjustments()
