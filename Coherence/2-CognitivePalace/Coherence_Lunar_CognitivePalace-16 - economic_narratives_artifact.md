## **OPERATIONAL SPECIFICATION**

### **Primary Function**
Decision support system for financial and resource management through coherent economic narratives that integrate money relationship, value creation, and abundance experience with sustainable resource stewardship and authentic prosperity.

    if economic_narrative_misalignment_detected(economic_effectiveness):
        recommend_financial_framework_adjustment()
    
    # Resource Integration Analysis
    abundance_satisfaction = assess_resource_coherence_effectiveness(resource_data, abundance_narratives)
    if economic_direction_confusion_detected(abundance_satisfaction):
        suggest_financial_integration_enhancement_strategies()
    
    # Financial Balance Validation
    abundance_sustainability = evaluate_economic_sustainability(abundance_narratives, financial_energy_patterns)
    if economic_imbalance_risk_detected(abundance_sustainability):
        recommend_resource_abundance_adjustments()
    
    return economic_coherence_report, abundance_optimization_suggestions, resource_enhancement_opportunities
