    influence_expansion = measure_consciousness_development_effects(influence_traces)
    resource_regeneration = analyze_abundance_creation_patterns(resource_traces)
    
    # Impact Optimization Analysis
    leverage_opportunities = identify_multiplication_potential(all_traces)
    sustainability_risks = detect_depletion_patterns(resource_traces)
    
    if high_leverage_opportunities_detected(leverage_opportunities):
