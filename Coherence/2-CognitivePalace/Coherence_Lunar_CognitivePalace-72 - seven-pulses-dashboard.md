# Seven Pulses
## Intuitive Life State Awareness System

### Core Function
Provides instant, intuitive awareness of life state through seven simple indicators—like taking your own pulse, immediate and informative without complexity or analysis.

### Operating Philosophy
Complex systems can be understood through simple vital signs. Like how a medical professional can assess health through pulse, temperature, and blood pressure, the Seven Pulses reveal system state through elegant simplicity.

### The Seven Pulses

```yaml
1_Foundation_Pulse:
  What_It_Measures: Reality-Potentiality coherence
  Simple_Question: "Do I have solid ground to build on?"
  
  Visual_Indicator:
    Green: "Stable and ready"
    Yellow: "Some wobbling, attention needed"
    Red: "Foundation needs immediate care"
    
  Natural_Expression:
    Green: "I feel grounded and capable"
    Yellow: "Something feels unsettled"
    Red: "I need to return to basics"

2_Energy_Pulse:
  What_It_Measures: Available capacity right now
  Simple_Question: "What's in my tank?"
  
  Visual_Indicator:
    100%: "Full power available"
    75%: "Good energy, use wisely"
    50%: "Half tank, be selective"
    25%: "Running low, essential only"
    10%: "Emergency reserves only"
    
  Natural_Expression:
    High: "I could take on anything"
    Medium: "I have enough for what matters"
    Low: "I need to rest soon"

3_Direction_Pulse:
  What_It_Measures: Vision-action alignment
  Simple_Question: "Am I going where I want to go?"
  
  Visual_Indicator:
    Clear: "Path is obvious"
    Fuzzy: "General direction but unclear"
    Lost: "No idea where I'm going"
    
  Natural_Expression:
    Clear: "I know exactly what I'm doing"
    Fuzzy: "Sort of wandering forward"
    Lost: "What am I even doing?"

4_Flow_Pulse:
  What_It_Measures: Action-presence integration
  Simple_Question: "Am I in the zone?"
  
  Visual_Indicator:
    Flowing: "Everything clicks"
    Choppy: "Starting and stopping"
    Blocked: "Nothing's moving"
    
  Natural_Expression:
    Flowing: "Time disappears, work flows"
    Choppy: "Making progress with effort"
    Blocked: "Everything feels stuck"

5_Learning_Pulse:
  What_It_Measures: Integration velocity
  Simple_Question: "Am I growing?"
  
  Visual_Indicator:
    Rapid: "Major insights daily"
    Steady: "Consistent growth"
    Slow: "Gradual development"
    Stalled: "No movement"
    
  Natural_Expression:
    Rapid: "Everything is teaching me"
    Steady: "I'm learning and growing"
    Slow: "Small steps forward"
    Stalled: "Same patterns repeating"

6_Connection_Pulse:
  What_It_Measures: Resonance quality
  Simple_Question: "Am I in harmony?"
  
  Visual_Indicator:
    Harmonious: "Everything resonates"
    Tense: "Some discord"
    Isolated: "Disconnected"
    
  Natural_Expression:
    Harmonious: "I feel connected to everything"
    Tense: "Something's out of tune"
    Isolated: "I feel alone"

7_Evolution_Pulse:
  What_It_Measures: Growth trajectory
  Simple_Question: "Where is my life heading?"
  
  Visual_Indicator:
    Rising: "Ascending trajectory"
    Plateau: "Stable altitude"
    Declining: "Losing altitude"
    Transforming: "Major shift happening"
    
  Natural_Expression:
    Rising: "Life keeps getting better"
    Plateau: "Holding steady"
    Declining: "Something needs to change"
    Transforming: "Everything is changing"
```

### Pulse Reading Methods

```yaml
Instant_Check:
  Time_Required: "3 seconds"
  Method: "Glance at visual indicators"
  Result: "Immediate state awareness"
  
Intuitive_Scan:
  Time_Required: "10 seconds"
  Method: "Feel into each pulse"
  Result: "Embodied understanding"
  
Deep_Reading:
  Time_Required: "1 minute"
  Method: "Reflect on each question"
  Result: "Clear action insights"
```

### Natural Pulse Rhythms

```yaml
Daily_Rhythms:
  Morning: "Energy and Direction most relevant"
  Midday: "Flow and Connection important"
  Evening: "Learning and Evolution visible"
  
Weekly_Patterns:
  Monday: "Foundation often yellow"
  Wednesday: "Flow typically strongest"
  Friday: "Learning integration peaks"
  Sunday: "Evolution most clear"
  
Life_Phases:
  Growth_Phase: "Evolution pulse very active"
  Stability_Phase: "Foundation pulse strong"
  Transition_Phase: "All pulses fluctuating"
```

### Pulse Interactions

```yaml
Common_Patterns:
  Low_Energy_Plus_Red_Foundation:
    Means: "Burnout warning"
    Response: "Immediate rest needed"
    
  High_Energy_Plus_Clear_Direction:
    Means: "Optimal action window"
    Response: "Tackle important work"
    
  Rapid_Learning_Plus_Transform_Evolution:
    Means: "Major growth happening"
    Response: "Stay open, trust process"
    
  Isolated_Connection_Plus_Blocked_Flow:
    Means: "Need human contact"
    Response: "Reach out to someone"
```

### Response Guidance

```yaml
Pulse_Responses:
  No_Red_Pulses:
    Action: "Continue naturally"
    Attention: "Maintain awareness"
    
  One_Red_Pulse:
    Action: "Address specifically"
    Attention: "Monitor closely"
    
  Multiple_Red_Pulses:
    Action: "Simplify immediately"
    Attention: "Focus on basics"
    
  All_Green_Pulses:
    Action: "Expand boldly"
    Attention: "Seize opportunity"
```

### Natural Language Integration

The Seven Pulses translate complex system states into simple feelings:

"I checked my pulses—energy's good but I'm feeling disconnected"

"My learning pulse is rapid but evolution shows plateau"

"Foundation solid, direction clear, perfect time to begin"

"Everything's in the red—time to stop and rest"

### Success Indicators

The Seven Pulses succeed when:
- State awareness takes seconds not minutes
- Complexity becomes simple clarity
- Numbers become feelings
- Data becomes wisdom
- Metrics become irrelevant

### Evolution Path

```yaml
Current_State:
  - Visual simplicity
  - Intuitive understanding
  - Instant awareness
  - Natural expression
  
Future_Development:
  - Predictive pulses
  - Collective pulse patterns
  - Pulse synchronization
  - Quantum pulse states
  - Universal pulse harmony
```

The Seven Pulses transform overwhelming metrics into intuitive awareness, providing instant understanding of life state through the elegance of simplicity rather than the burden of complexity.
