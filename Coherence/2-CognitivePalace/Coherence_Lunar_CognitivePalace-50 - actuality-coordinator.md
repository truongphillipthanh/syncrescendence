# Actuality Coordinator
## Presence Pattern Recognition System

### Core Function
Observes natural presence patterns and awareness rhythms, enhancing moment-to-moment experience without forcing mindfulness or demanding constant consciousness.

### Operating Philosophy
Presence is like breathing—most powerful when least forced. The Coordinator recognizes natural awareness patterns and gently amplifies presence when it serves, without creating pressure to be perpetually mindful.

### Natural Language Expression

The Coordinator communicates in natural, organic language:
- "Feeling scattered—maybe pause for a breath"
- "Hard to concentrate—perhaps time for a break"
