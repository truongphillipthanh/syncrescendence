# Reality-Imaginality Resonance Matrix
## Cross-Layer Data Flow and Dependency Specification

### Connection Overview
Maps bidirectional data flows between Reality Layer (axioms, values, attention) and Imaginality Layer (visions, possibilities, dreams), enabling coherent translation between foundational commitments and envisioned futures.

### Resonance Patterns

#### Harmonic Resonances (Reinforcing)
1. **Value-Vision Coherence**: Aligned values strengthen vision clarity
2. **Attention-Possibility Focus**: Focused attention reveals possibilities
3. **Worldview-Future Consistency**: Beliefs enable future imagination
4. **Experience-Dream Motivation**: Positive experience fuels dreams
5. **Identity-Story Integration**: Coherent identity creates better stories

#### Dissonant Patterns (Requiring Resolution)
1. **Value-Vision Conflict**: Dreams exceed value boundaries
2. **Belief-Possibility Tension**: Possibilities challenge worldview
3. **Attention-Dream Scatter**: Too many dreams fragment attention
4. **Experience-Vision Gap**: Reality disappoints expectations
5. **Identity-Legacy Misalignment**: Current self can't achieve legacy

### Dependency Management

**Critical Dependencies**:
```python
dependencies = {
    "Life Designer": ["Value Weaver", "Worldview Architect"],
    "Possibility Orchestrator": ["Salience Navigator", "Phenomenological Observer"],
    "Future Cartographer": ["Worldview Architect", "Value Weaver"],
    "Dream Weaver": ["Phenomenological Observer", "Numinous Gateway"],
    "Legacy Architect": ["Value Weaver", "Numinous Gateway"]
}
```

**Cascade Effects**:
- Reality axiom changes trigger complete Imaginality recalibration
- Major vision shifts require Reality layer validation
- Identity evolution cascades through both layers
- Value conflicts pause possibility generation

### Performance Metrics

**Flow Efficiency**:
- Data transmission latency: <100ms
- Transformation accuracy: >95%
- Channel utilization: 60-80% optimal
- Resonance stability: >85%

**Integration Quality**:
- Vision-value alignment: r > 0.8
- Possibility-attention correlation: >70%
- Story-experience coherence: >7/10
- Dream-reality gap: <25%

### Optimization Protocols

**Resonance Tuning**:
1. Monitor flow volumes and patterns
2. Identify bottlenecks and conflicts
3. Adjust channel parameters
4. Test resonance improvements
5. Document optimal configurations

**Conflict Resolution**:
- Priority: Reality layer takes precedence
- Method: Gradual vision adjustment
- Fallback: Vision scope reduction

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:

*Channel Overload*:
- Symptom: Processing delays
- Cause: Excessive possibility generation
- Solution: Implement flow throttling

*Resonance Collapse*:
- Symptom: Vision-value disconnection
- Cause: Unprocessed Reality shifts
- Solution: Reality-first recalibration

*Feedback Loops*:
- Symptom: Oscillating changes
- Cause: Over-responsive adjustments
- Solution: Damping coefficients
