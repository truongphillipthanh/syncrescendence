    if time_narrative_misalignment_detected(temporal_effectiveness):
        recommend_temporal_framework_adjustment()
    
    # Life Arc Experience Analysis
    trajectory_satisfaction = assess_life_arc_coherence_effectiveness(life_arc_data, time_narratives)
    if life_direction_confusion_detected(trajectory_satisfaction):

- Adaptive Readiness: Future as uncertainty requiring capability building and flexible response
- Vision-Guided Creation: Future as possibility requiring imagination and manifestation skills
- Probabilistic Preparation: Future as range of scenarios requiring risk assessment and contingency planning
- Emergent Response: Future as unfolding mystery requiring presence and improvisation capability

**Operational Implementation**:
- Use future philosophy to guide planning activities and preparation strategies
- Assess future engagement effectiveness for goal achievement and opportunity readiness
- Plan future preparation based on philosophy effectiveness and life direction goals

### **4. Past Integration Method**
**Decision Framework**: How do I relate to previous experience and personal history?
**Configuration Options**:
- Treasuring: Past as valuable resource of positive memories and achievement celebration
- Processing: Past as learning source requiring conscious integration and meaning-making
- Forgetting: Past minimization with focus on present and future
- Revising: Past reinterpretation and story updating based on current understanding
- Wisdom: Past transformation into guidance and understanding for present and future choices

**Operational Implementation**:
- Use past integration method to guide memory work and experience processing
- Assess past relationship effectiveness for learning and emotional well-being
- Plan past integration activities based on method effectiveness and healing goals

### **5. Duration Experience Philosophy**
**Decision Framework**: How do I experience and optimize the subjective quality of time passage?
**Configuration Options**:
- Rushed: Time as scarce resource requiring speed and efficiency maximization
- Patient: Time as abundant gift allowing for slow development and natural pacing
- Timeless: Time as illusion with focus on eternal present and non-temporal awareness
- Cyclical: Time as recurring patterns requiring rhythm recognition and natural flow
- Focused: Time as opportunity for deep engagement and concentrated attention

**Operational Implementation**:
- Apply duration philosophy to pacing choices and time quality optimization
- Assess time experience effectiveness for satisfaction and consciousness development
- Evaluate duration approach utility for life enjoyment and authentic expression
