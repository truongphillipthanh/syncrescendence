    if vocational_narrative_misalignment_detected(vocational_effectiveness):
        recommend_professional_framework_adjustment()
    
    # Contribution Integration Analysis
    value_satisfaction = assess_contribution_coherence_effectiveness(contribution_data, work_narratives)
    if professional_direction_confusion_detected(value_satisfaction):
        suggest_vocational_integration_enhancement_strategies()
    
    # Career Balance Validation
    work_sustainability = evaluate_professional_sustainability(work_narratives, career_energy_patterns)
    if vocational_imbalance_risk_detected(work_sustainability):
        recommend_career_work_adjustments()
    
    return vocational_coherence_report, career_optimization_suggestions, contribution_enhancement_opportunities
