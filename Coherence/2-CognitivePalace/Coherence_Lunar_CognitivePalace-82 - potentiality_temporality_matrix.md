### Optimization Protocols

**Continuous Monitoring**:
1. Track performance patterns naturally
2. Identify optimization opportunities organically
3. Test parameter adjustments gradually
4. Implement improvements smoothly
5. Monitor stability gently

**Resource-Time Balancing**:
- Method: Dynamic reallocation
- Frequency: Micro-adjustments as needed
- Constraints: Minimum recovery preserved
- Goal: Sustainable optimization

### Implementation Guidelines

**Activation Sequence**:
1. Map current capacity baselines
2. Document temporal patterns naturally
3. Connect energy-rhythm channels organically
4. Enable resource-time flows gradually
5. Activate full integration when ready

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:

*Energy-Time Debt Spiral*:
- Symptom: Increasing exhaustion
- Cause: Rhythm exceeds capacity
- Solution: Mandatory recovery injection

*Capability-Opportunity Miss*:
- Symptom: Missed key moments
- Cause: Poor readiness forecasting
- Solution: Anticipatory capacity building

*Resource-Schedule Gridlock*:
- Symptom: Nothing gets done
- Cause: Over-constrained system
- Solution: Priority-based triage

### Advanced Features

**Predictive Capacity Modeling**:
```python
forecast_capacity(timeframe, conditions) → capacity_curve
optimal_schedule(resources, constraints) → timeline
identify_leverage_moments(goals, capabilities) → opportunity_list
```

**Dynamic Rhythm Adjustment**:
```python
adapt_rhythm(energy_data, performance_goals) → new_rhythm
optimize_recovery(stress_level, timeline) → recovery_plan
balance_cycles(competing_rhythms) → harmonized_pattern
```

### API Specifications

```python
# Monitoring Functions
get_capacity_forecast(resource_type, timeframe) → array
get_rhythm_coherence() → score
get_resource_availability(timestamp) → dict

# Control Functions
adjust_rhythm(pattern_name, parameters)
