### Resonance Patterns

#### Harmonic Resonances (Reinforcing)
1. **Vision-Behavior Coherence**: Clear visions inspire effective habits
2. **Identity-Practice Alignment**: Authentic practices strengthen identity
3. **Possibility-Action Flow**: Rich possibilities generate meaningful tasks
4. **Dream-Ritual Power**: Sacred rituals manifest deeper dreams
5. **Future-Method Preparedness**: Visionary methods enable futures

#### Dissonant Patterns (Requiring Resolution)
1. **Vision-Behavior Gap**: Dreams exceed behavioral capacity
2. **Identity-Practice Conflict**: Practices contradict identity
3. **Possibility-Task Overwhelm**: Too many options paralyze action
4. **Dream-Ritual Disconnection**: Rituals lose sacred meaning
5. **Future-Method Inadequacy**: Current methods can't reach envisioned futures

### Dependency Management

**Critical Dependencies**:
```python
dependencies = {
    "Habit Architect": ["Life Designer", "Identity Synthesizer"],
    "Practice Weaver": ["Identity Synthesizer", "Dream Weaver"],
    "Task Orchestrator": ["Possibility Orchestrator", "Future Cartographer"],
    "Ritual Engine": ["Dream Weaver", "Practice Weaver"],
    "Method Synthesizer": ["Future Cartographer", "Task Orchestrator"]
}
```

**Cascade Effects**:
- Vision clarity enables behavioral specificity
- Identity coherence guides practice selection
- Possibility richness multiplies action options
- Dream depth intensifies ritual power

### Performance Metrics

**Translation Efficiency**:
- Vision-to-behavior conversion: >60%
- Identity-practice alignment: >85%
- Possibility-task generation: >3:1 ratio
- Dream-ritual coherence: >8/10

**Implementation Quality**:
- Habit sustainability: >70% retention
- Practice authenticity: >7/10 rating
- Task completion: >80% success
- Ritual meaning: >8/10 significance

### Optimization Protocols

**Translation Enhancement**:
1. Map vision-behavior gaps
2. Identify translation friction
3. Design bridge practices
4. Test implementation paths
5. Refine protocols

**Coherence Maintenance**:
- Regular alignment checks
- Practice authenticity audits
- Ritual meaning renewal
- Method effectiveness review

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:

*Translation Paralysis*:
- Symptom: Visions remain abstract
- Cause: Overwhelm or perfectionism
- Solution: Micro-practice design

*Practice Drift*:
- Symptom: Behaviors lose meaning
- Cause: Disconnection from vision
- Solution: Regular re-anchoring

*Method Inadequacy*:
- Symptom: Tools don't fit needs
- Cause: Evolving requirements
- Solution: Continuous method evolution

### Advanced Features

**Adaptive Translation**:
```python
generate_practice_path(vision, constraints) → practice_sequence
optimize_translation(dream, resources) → action_plan
bridge_gap(current_state, desired_state) → stepping_stones
```

**Practice Evolution Engine**:
```python
evolve_practice(behavior, feedback) → improved_practice
synthesize_method(requirements, context) → new_approach
design_ritual(meaning, form) → sacred_practice
```

### API Specifications

```python
# Query Functions
get_translation_efficiency(vision_id) → metrics
