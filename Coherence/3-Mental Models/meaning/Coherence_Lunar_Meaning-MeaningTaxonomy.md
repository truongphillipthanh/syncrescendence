# Comprehensive Ontology of Human Experience & Capability

## Integration with Meaning Taxonomy

Your **cognitive architecture** (principles → frameworks → methods → processes) represents the **operational structure** of meaning-making, while my **meaning taxonomy** maps the **content domains** where significance emerges. Together they form a complete system: *how* we organize knowledge and *what* that knowledge signifies.

**SYNTHESIS PRINCIPLE**: Every human experience operates simultaneously across multiple dimensions, with meaning emerging from their interaction and your cognitive tools providing the organizing structure.

## Structural Principles

**DIMENSIONAL INTERACTION**: Every human experience involves multiple dimensions simultaneously. Love, for example, operates across psychological (emotion), embodied (physical sensation), volitional (choice), social (relationship), spiritual (transcendence), and temporal (development) dimensions.

**PRECISION GRADIENTS**: Each dimension contains its own abstraction hierarchy, allowing for precise location of any human experience within multi-dimensional space.

**EMERGENT COMPLEXITY**: Higher-order human capacities emerge from dimensional integration—wisdom emerges from cognitive, temporal, and spiritual interaction; charisma from embodied, social, and aesthetic integration.

**DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES**: Humans move along these dimensions over time, with different dimensions developing at different rates and reaching different levels of sophistication.

This creates a complete **coordinate system** for mapping any aspect of human experience and capability with surgical precision.
