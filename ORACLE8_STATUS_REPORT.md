## PENDING WORK

### DIRECTIVE-031: Temporal Currency (READY FOR DISPATCH)

| Category | Items | Scope |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Model Reference Updates | 40+ locations | Cosmos tier priority |
| Date Anchor Updates | 3 locations | Cosmos tier |
| Modal 2 Acknowledgment | 1 insertion | CANON-00012 |
| Oracle 6-8 Documentation | ~80 lines | CANON-00004 |
| NVIDIA Valuation | 1 minor edit | CANON-00012 |

**Estimated Execution**: 30-45 minutes

---

## OUTSTANDING DECISIONS RESOLVED

### Decision 1: Modal 1 Timeline
**Resolution**: AFFIRM timeline, ADD Modal 2 acknowledgment
**Rationale**: Technology accelerating faster validates framework; conservative estimates proven sound

### Decision 2: Model References
**Resolution**: UPDATE to generalized "frontier models" pattern for temporal resilience
**Specific Updates**: Where precision matters, use January 2026 verified models (GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, Grok 4.1)

### Decision 3: NVIDIA $5T Claim
**Resolution**: Minor adjustment to "approximately $5 trillion"
**Verification**: $4.5-4.6T actual, touched $5T late 2025

### Decision 4: CANON-00004-EVOLUTION
**Resolution**: Include Oracle 6-8 documentation in DIRECTIVE-031
**Scope**: ~80 lines documenting semantic pass, ground truth orientation, and this session

## CORPUS STATE ASSESSMENT

### Structural Layer (Phase 2) ✓
- Flat CANON directory with 71 files
- Consistent naming convention
- Clear tier hierarchy
- Orchestration infrastructure protected

### Foyer Coherence (Phase 3A) ✓
- File counts accurate
- Cross-references correct
- Flowchart reflects current numbering
- Navigation functional

### Semantic Integrity (Phase 3B) ✓
- Encoding artifacts eliminated
- Redundancy collapsed
- Terminology harmonized
- Vestigial references corrected

### Temporal Currency (Phase 3C) ⏳
- DIRECTIVE-031 ready for dispatch
- Upon completion, corpus reflects January 2026 ground truth

---

## QUEUE ITEMS IDENTIFIED

### For Oracle9: Transcript Ingestion
- Architecture for processing accumulated transcripts
- Integration mechanism for external insights
- Storage decisions for source materials

### For Technology Lunar (Future)
- **Live Corpus Protocol**: Continuous updates vs serial snapshots
  - Automated currency checks
  - Versioned claims with temporal anchors
  - Temporal resilience patterns (generalize where possible, specify where necessary)

### For Broader Roadmap
- IIC configuration (informed by enriched corpus)
- Tooling stack decisions (GPT-5.2, Grok, Perplexity)
- MCP/Skills integration
- Automation opportunities
- Ontology project
- Curriculum development
- Branding

## VERIFICATION READINESS

When DIRECTIVE-031 completes, run final verification:

```bash
# No stale model references
grep -l "GPT-4[^o0-9]" CANON-*.md  # Empty expected
grep -l "Claude 3\." CANON-*.md     # Empty expected

# Oracle documentation complete
grep -c "Oracle 8" CANON-00004-EVOLUTION-cosmos.md  # 1+ expected

# No encoding artifacts
LC_ALL=C grep -l $'\xc3\xa2' CANON-*.md  # Empty expected

# File counts accurate
ls CANON-*.md | wc -l  # 71 expected
```

---

## ORACLE8 SCOPE COMPLETION CRITERIA

Oracle8 is complete when:
- [x] DIRECTIVE-029 executed and verified
- [x] DIRECTIVE-030 executed and verified
- [ ] DIRECTIVE-031 executed and verified
- [ ] Final verification suite passes
- [ ] Execution logs archived to orchestration/
- [ ] Status report confirms corpus at superlativity standard

**Estimated Time to Completion**: Upon DIRECTIVE-031 execution (~45 minutes)

---

## HANDOFF TO ORACLE9

When Oracle8 completes, Oracle9 inherits:
- **Clean corpus**: 71 CANON files at semantic superlativity
- **Accurate technology references**: January 2026 verified
- **Complete decision genealogy**: Oracle 0-8 documented
- **Identified next work**: Transcript ingestion architecture

Oracle9 focus: Processing accumulated transcripts, creating ingestion protocol, integrating external insights.
