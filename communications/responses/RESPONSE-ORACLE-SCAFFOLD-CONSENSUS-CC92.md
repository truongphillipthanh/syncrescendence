# RESPONSE-ORACLE-SCAFFOLD-CONSENSUS-CC92

**Response ID**: `RESPONSE-ORACLE-SCAFFOLD-CONSENSUS-CC92`
**Date**: `2026-03-08`
**Observed**: `Metadata normalization frame added for validator compatibility; substantive response body preserved.`

**1. Institutional Verdict**

Fundamentally correct. The successor-shell institutional topology implements the deliberate redesign required after the predecessor's "scaffolding Babel" failure mode (README.md: "too many overlapping directories, unclear artifact classes, bad prompt/response lineage, stale or orphaned notes, runtime truth/research/policy all mixed"). Observed reality (GitHub tree listings for root, communications/, offices/, operators/, validated-patterns/): root contains exactly the constitutional surfaces listed in AGENTS.md ("Allowed root entries are: AGENTS.md, BOOT.md, … communications/, executive/, … validated-patterns/"); communications/ has the exact subdirs (prompts/, responses/, assessments/, handoffs/, logs/, retros/) plus CHARTER.md and templates; offices/ has subdirs for each of the five federal offices plus README.md; operators/ has validators/, migrate/, exocortex/, office/ and concrete scripts (migrate_communications_chain.py, bootstrap_office.py). No observed root clutter or lane mixing. CH03-BUILT-REALITY-v1.md confirms: "the shell is already beyond concept stage… law can generate config, communications can be classed, offices can be physicalized, exocortex can be governed." Synthesis (beyond direct evidence): the cascade (Rosetta → Intent → Program → Execution → Reconciliation → Ontology) in ROSETTA-INTENT-BACKLOG-TRIAD-RECONSTITUTION-v1.md + federal office modalities in INTER-OFFICE.md now prevents recurrence of the old pathologies while preserving harness grain.

**2. What The Shell Already Gets Right**

- Root cleanliness and lane separation: AGENTS.md explicitly lists the 11 lane roots and forbids everything else at root; observed structure matches verbatim. Prevents "runtime truth, research, and policy all mixed."
- Federal office identities with modality routing: AGENTS.md defines Commander/Sovereign Executor, Adjudicator/Quality Gate, Ajna/Strategos, Cartographer/Exegete, Psyche/Synaptarch; INTER-OFFICE.md quotes: "Route by modality, not just by superficial task label." Observed: offices/{commander,adjudicator,ajna,cartographer,psyche}/ with local inbox/outbox/memory. DISSERTATION-CH02-INSTITUTIONAL-ARCHITECTURE-v1.md: "Each office is a federal-local workspace with a lawful burden."
- Communications as typed lineage surface: communications/README.md and subdirs match AGENTS.md exactly; templates (PACKET-TEMPLATE.md etc.) and migration tranches (COMMUNICATIONS-MIGRATION-TRANCHE-01.md etc.) show active normalization. WORK-LOOP.md: "prompts, responses, and handoffs belong in communications lineage."
- Compaction metabolism and pedigree preservation: CONTINUOUS-IMPROVEMENT.md mandates "compact successful repetition into a playbook, operator, validated pattern, or regulation artifact"; ROSETTA-STONE-EXEGESIS-v1.md: "Compaction is the shell's metabolism… logs should compact into regulation… prompts and responses into playbook patterns." Observed: validated-patterns/ has topical subdirs (communications/, office-operations/, quality/); pedigree/ holds ROSETTA-STONE-EXEGESIS-v1.md and originals/.
- Exocortex governance without sovereignty bleed: EXOCORTEX-TELEOLOGY-REGISTRY-CC90.md and EXOCORTEX-CONTROL-PLANE-CC91.md quote: "Repo remains constitutional authority… Exocortex surfaces execute, relay, and synthesize; they do not ratify policy… Every direction-changing connector change must land as typed registry/status artifacts." Observed control-plane JSON manifests and state machine.

**3. Where The Shell Is Still Architecturally Wrong Or Thin**

- Artifact-class taxonomy is declared at lane level but not fully enumerated or front-matter-enforced (AGENTS.md and COMMUNICATIONS-LAW-v1.md stop at high-level buckets; no explicit "prompt packet must contain X metadata" schema beyond templates). Thin relative to dissertation callout in CH02 for "separate artifact classes."
- Exocortex projection and registry artifacts have no dedicated lane home (orchestration/state/ holds JSON manifests and CC90/CC91 files, but these are impl, not constitutional; EXOCORTEX-CONTROL-PLANE-CC91.md leaves ontology projection operators unspecified in root law).
- Enforcement and drift detection are operatorized (operators/validators/, Makefile targets) but lack draconian "wrong-lane" auto-quarantine or mandatory front-matter validation on every commit (CONTINUOUS-IMPROVEMENT.md has loops but no enforcement hook quoted).
- Provisional surfaces (Manus, Google AI Studio, etc.) are listed in AGENTS.md as "Stage-0 provisional surface avatars" but lack explicit habitation law beyond exocortex registry; risk of ad-hoc playbooks leaking into offices/ or root (inferred from absence in INTER-OFFICE.md routing doctrine).

**4. Recommended Artifact-Class Constitution**

- Prompts / external response packets: ideal home communications/{prompts,responses}/ (observed subdirs + templates); retention until handoff/assessment complete; must be compacted into playbooks/ or validated-patterns/ (WORK-LOOP.md metabolic rule: "compact before context decays").
- Assessments / dispatches / handoffs / retrospectives: communications/{assessments,handoffs,retros}/; short retention; compact into continuous-improvement/ artifacts or playbooks/ (CONTINUOUS-IMPROVEMENT.md: "record anti-patterns… propose one improvement").
- Office-local scratch: offices/{office-name}/ (observed structure); ephemeral retention; promote only via Commander receipt (INTER-OFFICE.md: "make the next office's burden lighter").
- Logs: communications/logs/ or runtime/; short retention; compact into operators/ or validated-patterns/ (ROSETTA-STONE-EXEGESIS-v1.md metabolism quote above).
- Operators/scripts: operators/ (observed validators/, migrate/, etc.); permanent once validated; never move to root.
- Runtime snapshots: runtime/; short retention; project only (never store as law); compact to ontology via control-plane (EXOCORTEX-CONTROL-PLANE-CC91.md).
- Validated patterns: validated-patterns/{topic}/ (observed subdirs); permanent; source of playbook promotion.
- Canonical doctrine / law: root files + orchestration/state/impl/ (constitutional layer per CH02); immutable after ratification.
- Pedigree / originals / rehousing receipts: pedigree/ (observed); archival, never delete (ROSETTA-INTENT-BACKLOG-TRIAD-RECONSTITUTION-v1.md: "preserve historical evolution").
- Ontology projection artifacts: orchestration/state/ or dedicated registry/ (inferred from control-plane JSONs); non-authoritative projection only.
- Exocortex registry/control-plane artifacts: orchestration/state/ (observed JSON manifests); versioned; never contain secrets (EXOCORTEX-CONTROL-PLANE-CC91.md explicit rule).

**5. Recommended Lane-by-Lane Filing Law**

- communications/: constitutional home for all raw lineage (prompts/responses/handoffs/logs/assessments/retros); belongs: typed packets only (templates enforce); does not belong: canon, doctrine, or unassessed scratch (quote AGENTS.md and communications/CHARTER.md); interfaces via receipts to offices/ and operators/migrate/.
- executive/: live steering (INTENT-COMPASS.live.md per BOOT.md); belongs: current intentions, campaigns; does not belong: runtime logs or research feedstock; interfaces upward to program/, downward via dispatch to offices/.
- knowledge/: living domain canon and feedstock (KNOWLEDGE-LANE-LAW-v1.md verbatim: "neither constitutional law… nor raw runtime state"); belongs: references/, canon/, feedstock/ with intake receipts; does not belong: lineage packets or pedigree; interfaces via compaction operators to playbooks/ and validated-patterns/.
- offices/: federal-local workspaces (AGENTS.md + observed subdirs); belongs: inbox/outbox/memory/scratch/playbooks per office; does not belong: federal law or exocortex manifests; interfaces via INTER-OFFICE routing + handoffs.
- operators/: execution machinery (observed validators/, exocortex/, migrate/); belongs: scripts, bridges, validators; does not belong: prompts or doctrine; interfaces as promotion gates from communications/ and runtime/.
- orchestration/: redesign and constitutional state (CH02/CH03 + observed state/impl/); belongs: dissertations, registries, control-plane; does not belong: live work or scratch; interfaces as source of truth to all other lanes.
- pedigree/: ancestry only (ROSETTA-INTENT-BACKLOG-TRIAD-RECONSTITUTION-v1.md); belongs: originals, exegeses, disposition matrices; does not belong: active law; interfaces read-only.
- playbooks/: harness/surface doctrine (AGENTS.md + Oracle PLAYBOOK.md); belongs: surface-specific guidance; does not belong: federal invariants; interfaces downward from constitution.
- program/: executable backlog and tranches (ROSETTA-INTENT-BACKLOG-TRIAD-RECONSTITUTION-v1.md binding rules); belongs: IMPLEMENTATION-BACKLOG.live.md with upward refs; does not belong: raw research; interfaces to executive/ and offices/.
- runtime/: copied evidence (CH03); belongs: snapshots, status; does not belong: law; interfaces via projection to ontology.
- validated-patterns/: staged proven patterns (observed subdirs); belongs: patterns ready for playbook promotion; does not belong: volatile work; interfaces to operators/ and playbooks/.

**6. Agent / Surface Habitation Matrix**

- Manus / Fabricator: exocortex-only + playbook (playbooks/fabricator/); authority: execution/automation only; no law-making or ratification (EXOCORTEX-TELEOLOGY-REGISTRY-CC90.md: manus_surface in model cluster; AGENTS.md stage-0 avatar).
- Google AI Studio / Alchemist: exocortex-only + playbook (playbooks/alchemist/); authority: synthesis only; no constitutional change (same registry non-duplication law).
- NotebookLM / Archivist: knowledge-lane playbook + exocortex projection; authority: intake/compaction support; no doctrine ownership (KNOWLEDGE-LANE-LAW-v1.md boundaries).
- Opencode / Outrider: operators/ + playbook (operators/outlier/); authority: exploration scripting; provisional runtime-only until validated.
- OpenHands / Automator: operators/ (observed automation/ in validated-patterns/ pattern); authority: deterministic automation; no strategy.
- Aider / Pairwright: offices/Commander playbook (pair-programming surface); authority: local execution aid; never federal gate (INTER-OFFICE modalities).

All remain non-federal; new offices forbidden to prevent fragmentation (Rosetta exegesis federal reading).

**7. Draconian Enforcement Rules**

- Naming discipline: every artifact YYYY-MM-DD-{office}-{task-id}-{class}.md (e.g., 2026-03-06-commander-shell-audit-assessment.md); Makefile check-artifact-law fails otherwise (README.md validator target).
- Validator scripts: operators/validators/ must run on every boot and before promotion (bootstrap_office.py + migrate_communications_chain.py already present); "wrong lane" detection moves file and creates receipt.
- Promotion gates: Commander receipt required for anything leaving communications/ or offices/ into playbooks/ or validated-patterns/ (INTER-OFFICE.md + AGENTS.md sovereign executor role).
- Retention/compaction rules: communications/ artifacts older than 30 days without compaction assessment auto-quarantined; CONTINUOUS-IMPROVEMENT.md weekly loop mandatory.
- Forbidden-file patterns: .gitattributes + .gitignore block any root .md except the 9 constitutional files; no secrets or full transcripts in orchestration/state/ (EXOCORTEX-CONTROL-PLANE-CC91.md).
- Doctrine for local vs promoted: office-local scratch stays local until "repeated successful work" (CONTINUOUS-IMPROVEMENT.md) triggers Commander handoff; pedigree never promoted.

**8. Migration Moves To Make Next**

1. Run `make inventory` and `make check-artifact-law` (README.md) to baseline current state.
2. Migrate remaining communications chains using operators/migrate_communications_chain.py (already built; assessments/COMMUNICATIONS-MIGRATION-TRANCHE-0x.md pattern).
3. Slot provisional surfaces by creating playbooks/{surface}/PLAYBOOK.md templates and updating EXOCORTEX-TELEOLOGY-REGISTRY-CC90.json (per registry rule).
4. Promote repeated patterns from communications/ and offices/ into validated-patterns/ and playbooks/ using CONTINUOUS-IMPROVEMENT.md directive-close loop.
5. Add front-matter schema validator to operators/ and update COMMUNICATIONS-LAW-v1.md + AGENTS.md with full artifact taxonomy.
6. Update ROSETTA-INTENT-BACKLOG-TRIAD-RECONSTITUTION-v1.md disposition matrix to mark completed migrations; archive any remaining pre-successor matter to pedigree/originals/.
7. Run exocortex-connector-verification-run (EXOCORTEX-CONTROL-PLANE-CC91.md) and project final control-plane state to ontology. 

All moves preserve lossless pedigree and enforce one-artifact-one-class.
