# Findings & Decisions

## Context
- **Agent**: Cartographer (CIO / Exegete)
- **Status**: Reactivated from HIBERNATED state (DA-01, 2026-02-11).
- **Mandate**: Produce >100 lines per task to maintain signal-to-noise ratio.

## Research Findings
- **Inbox**: Found `TASK-MODEL-INDEX-REFRESH.md` in `-INBOX/cartographer/00-INBOX0/`.
- **Strategic Intentions**: INT-1612 (Begin ALL automations) and INT-1209 (Temporal intelligence refresh) are current P0/P1 priorities.
- **System Time**: Fri Feb 13 02:45 UTC 2026. (Note: User context stated Thursday Feb 12, likely due to timezone offset).
- **Substrate Health**: Many staged/unstaged changes exist from other agents (Commander/Ajna). Must be careful with commits.

## Decisions
- **Session ID**: `mm-cartographer` (Manus Mode for Cartographer).
- **Fidelity**: Tactical clarescence (Passes 0+1-3) deemed sufficient for reactivation.
- **Archive Policy**: Moved Adjudicator's security audit planning files to `orchestration/archive/planning-backups/`.
- **Commit Strategy**: Will only stage and commit files related to Cartographer's reactivation and the specific refresh task.
