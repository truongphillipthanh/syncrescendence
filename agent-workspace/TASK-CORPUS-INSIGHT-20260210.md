**Generated by**: claudecron/corpus-insight
**Status**: PENDING

## Activity Summary
- Commits (last 24h): 65+
- Files modified (last 24h): 149 .md files
- Active intentions: 22 active (4 urgent, 5 sprint, 13 session 15-16)
- Resolved intentions: 17
- Pending capture items: 10 (untriaged)
- Unprocessed inbox items: 21 (7 CONFIRM, 7 RESULT, 7 EXECLOG — all from clarescence delegates)

## Velocity Assessment

**HIGH VELOCITY on infrastructure/refinement.** The last 24h saw massive clarescence activity:
- claresce^3 (triple-clarescence): 3 passes completed
- claresce^3v2: 3 additional passes completed
- SOVEREIGN-009/012/013 resolved (stack ratified, credentials migrated, Psyche restored)
- 6 ajna sync commits indicate active MBA↔mini coordination
- Wisdom auto-compaction triggered 6+ times (high throughput)

**Stalled intentions:**
- **INT-1201** (accounts self-sustaining by month end): Marked `failed`. Jan 31 deadline missed. No reset target visible — needs Sovereign input.
- **INT-1206** (Efficacy/Mastery/Transcendence IIC configs): Still `active` with no recent commits touching PROJ-002.
- **INT-1602** (IIC ingestion pipeline on Google ecosystem): Active but no implementation commits visible.
- **INT-1612** (Begin ALL automations): P0 urgent. claudecron Phase 1 deployed (3 launchd tasks), but Hazel/Zapier/n8n/webhook bridges remain unstarted.

**Progressing well:**
- Clarescence cycles running at unprecedented depth (^3 then ^3v2 = 6-pass refinement)
- Multi-agent delegation working: Adjudicator, Cartographer, Psyche all returning results
- Ajna sync cadence healthy (~5min intervals during active periods)

## Orphaned Work

1. **21 unprocessed inbox items**: 7 CONFIRM + 7 RESULT + 7 EXECLOG files sitting in `00-INBOX0/` from clarescence delegations. These are completion signals that should be acknowledged, reviewed, and archived to `40-DONE/`.
2. **ENGINE file modifications** (REF-SOVEREIGN_COCKPIT_MANIFEST.md, AVATAR files, REF-SKILLS_PIPELINE_MAP.md, MODEL-INDEX.md, etc.): Appear to be side effects of claresce^3v2 work but have no explicit intention link. Likely covered by INT-1202 (maximum velocity) as a catch-all.
3. **GEMINI.md** modified — no corresponding intention. Possibly incidental to constellation reconfiguration.

## Recommendations

1. **Process inbox backlog NOW**: 21 completion signals in `00-INBOX0/` need triage. Acknowledge CONFIRM files, review RESULT files for actionable findings, archive to `40-DONE/`. This is a protocol violation (anti-pattern: ignoring CONFIRM/RESULT files).

2. **Sovereign decision needed on INT-1201**: Revenue target failed Jan 31 deadline. Intention sits in `failed` limbo. Either reset with new target date or explicitly defer/supersede.

3. **Advance INT-1612 (automation P0)**: claudecron Phase 1 is live but only covers 3 launchd tasks. The Sovereign explicitly said "Begin ALL automations" — Hazel rules, Make/Zapier workflows, webhook bridges, and n8n flows remain untouched. This is the highest-priority gap between stated intention and actual work.
