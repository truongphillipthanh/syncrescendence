## Output

Received. Task is addressed to Ajna (claimed at `04:21:00Z`).

**Note**: As Psyche (MacBook Air), I cannot execute Ajna-lane tasks. Ajna (Mac mini host) will pick this up via its `watch_dispatch.sh` daemon.

**Status Check**: Ensure task file is visible in:
- Mac mini: `-INBOX/ajna/10-PENDING/`
- OR shared GitHub/fs path that Ajna polls

**Not blocking**: Psyche clears queue. No action needed until Ajna RESULT receipt arrives.
