## Intention Alignment

| Intention | Progress Today | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| INT-1202 "maximize construction velocity" | Heavy ontology/annealment work + neo-canon pipeline. 22 substantive commits. | **On track** — high-throughput day |
| INT-1612 "Begin ALL automations" | Auto-ingest running, sync loop active (~5min cadence). macOS compat fix applied. | **Progressing** — automation infra maintained, no new automations added |
| INT-1501 "Maximize Claude Code autonomy" | Session 20→21 handoff pattern working. Inbox triage automated. | **Steady** |
| INT-1706 "Data Layer Sovereignty" | Ontology annealment v1→v2 with Palantir reconception. Heritage Map (174 concepts). | **Advancing** — major knowledge architecture work |
| INT-1701 "Progressive Disclosure" | Progressive summarization committed (10 batch digests + master). | **Advancing** |
| INT-1616 "LifeOS/PKM architectural convergence" | No direct progress. | **Stalled** |
| INT-1614 "Student/apprentice FDE modules" | No progress. | **Stalled** |
| INT-1602 "IIC ingestion pipeline" | No progress. | **Stalled** |

## Gap Analysis

**What worked**: The day was dominated by ontology annealment — a deep, multi-pass knowledge synthesis effort spanning v1 → v2 → verification → grand annealment → grand clarescence. This is high-value architectural work that directly serves INT-1706 (Data Layer Sovereignty) and INT-1202 (construction velocity).

**What didn't happen**:
1. **No new automation activations** (INT-1612). The sync loop and auto-ingest ran, but no new launchd/Make/webhook automations were deployed.
2. **No progress on personal domain integration** (INT-1614, INT-1615). Education, health/fitness, property management remain untouched.
3. **No IIC/feedcraft pipeline work** (INT-1602). Google ecosystem integration static.
4. **Session 2 was a zero-commit idle session** — 1 hour of wall-clock time with no output. Investigate whether this was a rate-limit stall or context death.

**Sync noise ratio**: ~60 sync(ajna) commits vs ~22 substantive commits = **73% of ledger entries are automated sync**. Consider suppressing sync commits from the ledger or batching them to reduce noise.

## Grand Clarescence Result

The day's culminating artifact — Grand Clarescence — scored **55/72 (76.4%) CONDITIONAL PASS**. This means 17 of 72 verification points still have gaps. These gaps should be the first target for tomorrow.

## Tomorrow's Priority

1. **Close the 17 Grand Clarescence gaps** (76.4% → target 90%+). The verification already identified specific failure points — execute against them.
2. **Neo-Canon Metaplan execution** — Session 21 handoff is staged. The metaplan should drive canon regeneration from the annealment outputs.
3. **Automation expansion** (INT-1612) — at least one new launchd automation or webhook bridge. The infrastructure is mature enough; the gap is activation, not architecture.

## Token Economics

- 3 recorded sessions (11:21, 12:29, 13:49)
- Session 1: moderate (19 commits, inbox triage + annealment v1)
- Session 2: minimal (zero commits — likely short or failed context)
- Session 3: heavy (42 commits, multi-phase annealment + neo-canon + clarescence)
- Estimated API spend: ~$3–5 across Commander sessions (heavy reading + writing days cost more)
- Sync loop: ~60 automated commits at minimal cost (git operations only, no API)
- Additional agent activity: Psyche bulletproof_v2 in progress, Adjudicator SCP sling verify dispatched
