# EXEMPLA: The Demonstration Layer

---

## Purpose

EXEMPLA provides what CANON describes and GENESIS narrates: **concrete demonstration**.

Theory without demonstration is abstraction. EXEMPLA grounds the architecture in reality by showing Syncrescendence principles in action—real case studies, worked examples, and documented applications.

---

## Structure (FLAT)

All files at root level with prefix conventions:

| Prefix | Purpose | Template |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **CASE-** | Success stories, failure analyses, real-world applications | CASE-TEMPLATE.md |
| **EXAMPLE-** | Step-by-step walkthroughs and how-to demonstrations | EXAMPLE-TEMPLATE.md |

---

## The Three-Layer Integration

| Layer | Function | Mode |
|-------|----------|------|
| **GENESIS** | Why + Origins | Mythopoetic |
| **CANON** | What + How | Operational |
| **EXEMPLA** | Demonstration | Evidential |

GENESIS provides meaning. CANON provides structure. EXEMPLA provides proof.

---

## Case Studies (CASE- prefix)

Each case study documents:
- **Context**: What problem or aspiration prompted the work
- **Approach**: Which CANON principles and practices were applied
- **Process**: What actually happened (including failures)
- **Results**: What outcomes emerged
- **Lessons**: What was learned for future application

See `CASE-TEMPLATE.md` for the standard format.

---

## Worked Examples (EXAMPLE- prefix)

Each worked example walks through:
- **Goal**: What we're trying to accomplish
- **Prerequisites**: What you need before starting
- **Steps**: Detailed walkthrough with actual examples
- **Verification**: How to confirm success
- **Variations**: Alternative approaches or adaptations

See `EXAMPLE-TEMPLATE.md` for the standard format.

---

## Current State

This layer is **bootstrapped and awaiting population**.

The architecture exists; the demonstrations will accumulate through practice. As practitioners apply Syncrescendent principles and document their work, EXEMPLA grows organically.

## Contributing

### Adding a Case Study

1. Copy `CASE-TEMPLATE.md` to `CASE-[descriptive-name].md`
2. Document actual experience (not hypothetical)
3. Include failures and lessons, not just successes
4. Connect to specific CANON documents where relevant
5. Submit for inclusion

### Adding a Worked Example

1. Copy `EXAMPLE-TEMPLATE.md` to `EXAMPLE-[descriptive-name].md`
2. Test the walkthrough yourself before documenting
3. Include actual screenshots, code, or artifacts where helpful
4. Verify steps work for a new practitioner
5. Submit for inclusion

---

## Quality Standards

EXEMPLA content should be:
- **Real**: Based on actual experience, not theoretical projection
- **Honest**: Including failures, difficulties, and surprises
- **Connected**: Referencing relevant CANON documents
- **Replicable**: Detailed enough for others to learn from
- **Evolving**: Updated as understanding deepens

---

## Relationship to CANON

EXEMPLA demonstrates CANON. When you read about the Seven Pulses in CANON-10000, EXEMPLA shows what daily Seven Pulses practice actually looks like over months.

| CANON Document | EXEMPLA Demonstration |
|----------------|----------------------|
| CANON-10000 (Celestial Body) | Case study: 90 days of Seven Pulses tracking |
| CANON-31140 (IIC Constellation) | Worked example: Setting up five-account architecture |
| CANON-35110 (Transcendence System) | Case study: Degree progression from Recognition to Exploration |
| CANON-33110 (Business Backbone) | Worked example: Quarterly revenue review using framework |

*Theory instructs. Practice embodies. EXEMPLA bridges.*
