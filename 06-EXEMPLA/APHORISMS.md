# Aphorisms

Compressed wisdom from Syncrescendence operations.

## On Persistence

**"Rivers flow into wells before evaporation."**
Conversations are rivers—ephemeral. The repository is a well—persistent.
Commit before closing tabs.

**"Wells persist; rivers are ephemeral."**
Cloud platforms have ephemeral memory. The repository is permanent, version-controlled, consistent.
Make the repository ground truth; treat platforms as cache.

## On Attention

**"The bottleneck is Principal attention, not information access."**
The system exists to allocate attention to what matters.
Everything else is infrastructure in service of that allocation.

**"Memory that matters is memory you use."**
A knowledge base of ten thousand items you never query is worse than useless—
it creates the illusion of understanding where none exists.

## On Systems

**"Metabolism applies to content, NOT orchestration infrastructure."**
State files and logs are living infrastructure that must be maintained.
Never delete operational infrastructure thinking it's content to metabolize.

**"Directives must be comprehensive—Principal is bottleneck."**
Have executors stage, evaluate, and execute in one cycle.
Minimize relay. Frame holistically, not incrementally.

---

## On Platforms

**"Don't lobotomize platforms to get determinism."**
Account for unreliability to get genuine intelligence.
The tradeoff we accept: platform quirks in exchange for richer outputs.

**"Each platform contributes from strength, not assigned role."**
Gemini automates; Grok grounds; Claude critiques; ChatGPT invents.
The Chorus works when ideation is genuine.
