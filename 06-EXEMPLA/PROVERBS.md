# Proverbs

Operational heuristics with context and application.

## PROVERB: The Failure Mode of PKM

**Statement**: "The failure mode of every personal knowledge management system is that
it becomes a substitute for thinking rather than an amplifier of it."

**Context**: Claude's critique during Acumen IIC architecture discussion (Jan 2026).

**Application**: When building pipelines, ask: "Does this preserve the cognitive
struggle, or replace it?" Automation should allocate attention, not eliminate engagement.

## PROVERB: The Globe Before Trees

**Statement**: "Infrastructure must precede content work."

**Context**: Coherence-first processing requires holistic visibility before tactical
execution. Building content pipelines before infrastructure creates orphaned artifacts.

**Application**: When tempted to process content immediately, first ask: "Is the
infrastructure to receive this output actually ready?"

## PROVERB: The Ledger is Ground Truth

**Statement**: "tasks.csv is truth for work status. Before claiming complete, verify
IN_PROGRESS tasks are DONE. Operate ledgers, don't just scaffold them."

**Context**: Tendency to create tracking systems but not actually update them.

**Application**: If a ledger exists, it must be operated. If it's not being operated,
delete it. No zombie infrastructure.

**Source**: Compass memory architecture

## PROVERB: Type 1 and Type 2 Decisions

**Statement**: "Reversible decisions should be made quickly. Irreversible decisions
demand deliberation."

**Context**: Bezos framework applied to Syncrescendence operations.

**Application**:
- Token generation: Type 2 (trivially reversible) → move fast
- Canonization: Type 1 (changes repo state) → deliberate
- File deletion: Type 1 (without backup) → requires Principal approval

**Source**: Lens framework (Reversibility lens)
