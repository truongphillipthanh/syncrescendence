## Objective

Conduct deep exegesis of the following narrative universes, extracting paradigms, organizational structures, and design patterns that can be applied to the Syncrescendence constellation architecture:

### 1. Mass Effect
- Galactic Council governance model (representative democracy across species)
- Spectre autonomy model (agents with sovereign authority + accountability)
- Mass relay network as communication infrastructure metaphor
- Reaper cycles as existential AI risk pattern
- Cerberus as "rogue agent" organizational failure mode

### 2. Warhammer 40k
- Imperium of Man organizational resilience (bureaucratic yet 10,000-year survival)
- Machine Spirit (Animus Machina) concept — technology as ensouled
- Adeptus Mechanicus as AI priesthood (maintaining technology through ritual/ontology)
- The God-Emperor's will persisting through institutional structure after incapacitation
- Chaos as adversarial AI / alignment failure

### 3. Civilization (Sid Meier)
- Tech tree as dependency chain (map to IMPLEMENTATION-MAP tranches)
- Wonders as CANON-equivalent unique constructions
- Age advancement gates (investment thresholds for capability jumps)
- Culture victory vs domination victory (ontological vs brute-force approaches)

### 4. Age of Empires
- Economy modeling (resource types, gathering rates, market dynamics)
- Age transitions as modal shifts (investment → unlock → new capabilities)
- Villager economy → military economy transition

## Expected Output

Produce a synthesis document at: `-OUTBOX/cartographer/RESULT-NARRATIVE-EXEGESIS-20260209.md`

Format: Mapping table per universe showing (Source Concept → Syncrescendence Parallel → Design Implication). Include recommendations for CANON candidacy.

## Context Files
- `-SOVEREIGN/SOVEREIGN-012-NARRATIVE_DNA_AND_AUTONOMY_EXPANSION.md` (current synthesis)
- `memory/narrative-dna.md` (persistent memory reference)
- `engine/REF-ROSETTA_STONE.md` (terminology to extend)
