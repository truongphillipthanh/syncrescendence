# Corpus Insight Report — 2026-02-12

**Generated by**: claudecron/corpus-insight
**Status**: PENDING

## Activity Summary
- Commits (last 24h): 99
- Files modified (last 24h): 172
- Active intentions: 30 (4 urgent, 10 sprint/session-15, 16 session-16/backlog)
- Pending inbox items: 4 (1 session review + 3 stale watchdog tasks)

## Velocity Assessment

**High velocity, infrastructure-heavy.** The 99 commits break down roughly as:
- ~30 sync(ajna) automated MBA syncs — operational heartbeat, not human work
- ~15 chore/hook artifact syncs — automation overhead
- ~20 feat commits — real feature work (ontology enrichment, MBA Commander reinit, watchdog hardening, skill installs, inbox cleanup tooling)
- ~10 dispatch/task lifecycle — multi-agent coordination
- ~5 auto-compact wisdom — threshold-triggered maintenance

**Progressing intentions:**
- **INT-MI19** (Palantir ontology): Strong progress — 29→142 records, 484 Airtable records synced, 21 query commands, surface dashboard, Makefile targets. This was the session's primary throughput.
- **INT-1612** (Begin automations): Watchdog hardening, command doctrine codified, dispatch.sh improvements. Infrastructure is being built but not yet activated end-to-end.
- **INT-1504** (MBA cascade): DA-13 MBA Commander reinit prompt written. Dual-residency documented. Operational.
- **INT-1202** (Maximum velocity): Session demonstrated sustained high output — 99 commits in ~12h.

**Stalled intentions:**
- **INT-1201** (Self-sustaining accounts): Marked "failed" since Jan 31. No new revenue-facing work visible. No reset target set by Sovereign.
- **INT-1601** (Syncrescript): No commits referencing SYN-37.
- **INT-1602/1605** (Google ecosystem/NotebookLM): No activity.
- **INT-1607** (Setapp audit): No activity.
- **INT-1608/1609** (Apple Notes/YouTube extraction): No activity.
- **INT-1614/1615/1616** (Education, health, LifeOS): No activity.

## Orphaned Work

- **3 stale WATCHDOG tasks** in commander inbox (TASK-WATCHDOG-20260211*) — these appear to be self-healing watchdog dispatches that were never claimed or resolved. They should be triaged or swept to DONE.
- **TASK-SESSION-REVIEW-20260211.md** — pending session review task sitting unclaimed.
- **Identity config drift (Ajna)**: INT-1612 automation audit was misrouted — MBA OpenClaw identified as Psyche instead of Ajna. Logged in ledger but not remediated.
- **2 FAILED results** in 50_FAILED/: `ecosystem_health` and `KINETIC_LAYER_DATA` from adjudicator — unprocessed failure artifacts.
- **REF-AIRTABLE_INTEGRATION.md** and **REF-ROSETTA_STONE.md** modified but no corresponding commit visible — uncommitted changes at risk.

## Recommendations

1. **Triage stale inbox**: Sweep the 3 watchdog tasks and 1 session review from `00-INBOX0/` — either execute or archive. Unprocessed inbox items violate Invariant 4 (Continuation/Deletability).

2. **Fix Ajna identity drift**: The misrouted INT-1612 task (Ajna identifying as Psyche) signals a config issue on MBA. Before dispatching more automation audit tasks, verify `~/.claude/settings.json` identity fields on MBA.

3. **Commit uncommitted changes**: `git status` shows modified `REF-AIRTABLE_INTEGRATION.md`, `REF-ROSETTA_STONE.md`, DYN-* state files, and `.constellation/state/current.yaml` — 8+ files with unstaged changes. This violates Invariant 3 (Receipts/Closure Gate). Stage and commit before next session.
