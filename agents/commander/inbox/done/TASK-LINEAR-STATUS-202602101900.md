## Assignments
- **All 23 issues are unassigned.** No team member has claimed any active work.

## Recommendations

1. **SYN-16 needs attention**: The only In Progress issue hasn't been updated in 4 days and has no assignee. Either assign it and push forward, or move it back to Todo if blocked.
2. **SYN-24 (P0-Critical) is sitting in Todo**: "Complete Mastery IIC account email setup" is flagged Critical but hasn't moved. This should be triaged immediately.
3. **SYN-31 (Priority 1) is actionable**: "Live Ledger Infrastructure — cron-dispatched sensing pipeline" is the highest-priority Todo. Consider promoting to In Progress.
4. **Zero assignments across the board**: Every issue is unassigned. Consider a triage session to assign owners to at least the Urgent/High items.
5. **New issues (SYN-51–60) are all P3**: The recent onboarding/tooling batch is correctly low-priority. No action needed unless dependencies emerge.
