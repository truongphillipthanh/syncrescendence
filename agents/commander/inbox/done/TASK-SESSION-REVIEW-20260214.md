## Sessions Today

| Time (PST) | Fingerprint | Commits | Changes | Key Activity |
|------------|-------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| 07:00 | df800bc | 0 | 81 files, +764/-5413 | Automated session (hook-triggered), no new commits — ledger checks only |
| 13:01 | 4253fe7 | 2 | 5 files, +325 | Ajna sync + Adjudicator ecosystem health task dispatch/complete |

**Total interactive sessions**: 2 (both automated/cron-triggered)
**Total Sovereign-driven sessions**: 0

## Commits Today

| Hash | Message | Type |
|------|---------|------|
| f25d4d9 | sync(ajna): inbox/outgoing sync from MBA [2026-02-14T15:01:43Z] | sync |
| 4253fe7 | sync(ajna): inbox/outgoing sync from MBA [2026-02-14T16:02:05Z] | sync |
| 562713b | sync(ajna): inbox/outgoing sync from MBA [2026-02-14T21:03:53Z] | sync |

**Analysis**: All 3 commits are automated Ajna sync operations. Zero human-initiated commits. Zero feature/fix/refactor work.

## Ledger Activity

| Timestamp | Event | Agent | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------------|
| 03:03 | COMMIT | commander | Ajna sync |
| 05:04 | COMMIT | commander | Ajna sync |
| 15:01 | COMMIT | commander | Ajna sync |
| 16:00 | DISPATCH | dispatch | Adjudicator ecosystem health task |
| 16:00 | CLAIM+COMPLETE | adjudicator | Ecosystem health (9-second turnaround) |
| 16:02 | COMMIT | commander | Ajna sync |
| 21:03 | COMMIT | commander | Ajna sync |

## Intention Alignment

| Intention | Progress Today | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| INT-1202 "capitalize on heavy machinery" | No feature work executed | **STALLED** — day entirely consumed by automation heartbeats |
| INT-1612 "Begin ALL automations" | Ajna sync + Adjudicator health running on schedule | **On track** — automation infrastructure operating as designed |
| INT-1501 "Maximize Claude Code autonomy" | No advancement | **Stalled** |
| INT-1503 "Close 30% gap to fiduciary" | No advancement | **Stalled** |
| INT-1504 "Cascade deployment MBA ↔ mini" | Ajna sync proving the pipeline works | **On track** (passive) |
| INT-1601 "Syncrescript synchronized to corpus" | No advancement | **Stalled** |
| INT-1616 "LifeOS/PKM architectural convergence" | No advancement | **Stalled** |

## Gap Analysis

**Critical observation**: Today was a **zero-output day** from the Sovereign's perspective. The system ran its automation heartbeat (5 Ajna syncs, 1 Adjudicator health check), but no human-directed work occurred. This is the second consecutive day (Feb 13-14) where commits are exclusively automated syncs.

**What the automation proves**: The launchd + watcher constellation is functioning — Ajna syncs reliably every ~4-6 hours, Adjudicator ecosystem health runs on schedule. INT-1612 ("Begin ALL automations") is quietly succeeding in the background.

**What it exposes**: The system generates operational noise (duplicate session log entries, repeated ledger checks against stale commits) but no substantive forward motion on any sprint-level intention.

**Execution staging quality issue**: DYN-EXECUTION_STAGING.md contains duplicate entries for the same session timestamps and repetitive ledger check logs against the same commit hash (e.g., df800bc appears 7 times). This suggests watcher hooks are firing redundantly.

## Tomorrow's Priority

1. **Sovereign engagement required** — The system is idling at high RPM. The automation layer is proven. What's needed now is a Sovereign-directed session to advance any of the 7+ stalled sprint intentions.
2. **Hook deduplication** — The duplicate session log entries and repeated ledger checks waste log space and obscure signal. Consider adding idempotency guards to `create_execution_log.sh` and `session_log.sh`.
3. **Recommended first directive**: INT-1616 (LifeOS/PKM convergence) or INT-1601 (Syncrescript) — both are high-value, self-contained enough for a single focused session.

## Token Economics

- **Estimated API spend today**: ~$0.50-1.00 (2 automated sessions × minimal context + 5 Ajna syncs + 1 Adjudicator dispatch)
- **ROI assessment**: Low — automation is burning tokens on heartbeats without advancing deliverables. This is acceptable during the "prove the infrastructure" phase but should transition to productive workloads soon.
