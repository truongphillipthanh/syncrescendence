## Directive

You are Commander (Opus) reinitializing on the MBA. This is the metaplan session.

**Enter /plan mode immediately.** The task is not to build the neo-canon — it is to design
the complete strategy for building it. The output of this session is a comprehensive architectural
blueprint: ARCH-NEO_CANON_METAPLAN.md.

## What This Session Accomplished (Context for Reinit)

This session (Session 21, 2026-02-17) completed the **Unified Annealment Trilogy**:

| Document | Lines | Content |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `ARCH-ONTOLOGY_ANNEALMENT_v2.md` | 787 | Canonical ontological synthesis (canon + metachar + scaffold + clarescence) |
| `CLARESCE-MASTER-DIGEST.md` | 356 | 66 clarescence files → all DEC-*, seared lessons, constructs |
| `RUNLOGS-MASTER-DIGEST.md` | 236 | Running logs → 22 painful lessons, failure forensics, agent grades |
| `ARCH-GRAND_ANNEALMENT.md` | 639 | **Terminal synthesis — all layers unified. READ THIS FIRST.** |

Supporting digests (all in `00-ORCHESTRATION/state/impl/.scratch/`):
- `ANNEAL-DIGEST-CANON-{0X,1X2X,30,31,32-35}.md` — canon digests (1,458 lines total)
- `ANNEAL-DIGEST-{GAPS,METACHAR,SCAFFOLD}.md` — gap/metachar/scaffold digests
- `ANNEAL-V2-PATCHES.md` — 8 gap patches applied to v2
- `RUNLOGS-DIGEST-{A-E}.md` — running logs batch digests
- `CLARESCE-DIGEST-{A-J}.md` — clarescence batch digests (in `impl/clarescence/.scratch/`)

The 04-SOURCES library is now accessible:
- `04-SOURCES/research/` — 44 files (~2.2MB)
- `04-SOURCES/processed/` — 42 files (~284KB)
- `04-SOURCES/research-notebooks/` — 15 notebooks

These have never been systematically digested. They are ready for Sonnet progressive summarization.

## The Sovereign's Directive: Neo-Canon as Spiritual Successor

The old canon (CANON-00000 through CANON-35999, 160+ files) grew by accretion. It carries
prescient insights embedded in vestigial structure. The directive is to build its spiritual
successor — not a migration, a generation-skip.

### The Software Succession Analogy

The Sovereign provided this framing (condensed):

> Languages gain dominance but accumulate legacy baggage over decades. Successors fix pain
> points by baking solutions into the compiler itself. Rust eliminated C's memory danger.
> TypeScript eliminated JavaScript's type chaos. Swift eliminated Objective-C's boilerplate.
> **These successors move the burden of correctness from the developer's brain to the language.**

Applied to the canon:
- **Old canon = C**: Power and depth, but manual addressing (CANON-30300 = meaningless number),
  no structural coherence guarantees, reader bears all interpretive burden
- **Neo-canon = Rust**: Every concept has semantic address derived from its position in the
  nucleic core hierarchy. Structure enforces coherence. Vestigial concepts fail the core
  derivation test automatically. Burden of correctness moves to the architecture.

The **nucleic core** IS the compiler. It defines the type system, the grammar, the garbage
collection (vestigial concepts are pruned by failing core derivation), and the safety guarantees.

### Heritage Principles

- **Keep**: Prescient, macroscopic, evergreen concepts — the ones that appeared in every synthesis
  angle regardless of approach. These are invariants.
- **Reframe**: Concepts with permanent value but ad-hoc expression — rename, restructure, anchor
  to the core, preserve the insight.
- **Prune**: Administrative/vestigial — numbering artifacts, session-specific notes, superseded
  framings that were never load-bearing.
- **Archive**: Historically significant but no longer operational — store with provenance,
  remove from active canon.

**Pedigree is mandatory**: Every neo-canon concept must trace its lineage. Where did it come from?
What old-canon concepts does it supersede? Heritage is not nostalgia — it is provenance.

## The Metaplan: 7 Layers

### Layer 0 — Orientation (Read First)

Before planning, read these in order:
1. `ARCH-GRAND_ANNEALMENT.md` (639 lines — terminal synthesis, delegate to Sonnet)
2. `CLARESCE-MASTER-DIGEST.md` (356 lines — §12 Grand Synthesis is key)
3. `RUNLOGS-MASTER-DIGEST.md` (236 lines — §8 Seared Lessons + §12 Grand Synthesis)

These three together give you the complete picture in ~1,200 lines.

### Layer 1 — Axiom Excavation

The nucleic core begins with axioms — the irreducible primitives from which everything derives.
Candidate axioms from this session's synthesis (require clarescence validation):

| # | Candidate Axiom | Evidence Source |
|---|----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Coherence as Scarce Resource** — personal ontology targets remaining-oneself under persuasion/overload/fragmentation, not efficiency | PATCH-003, grand annealment §12 |
| 2 | **Attention Bottleneck** (σ₀) — every structure and automation ultimately serves σ₀; the binding constraint is attention, not compute | CLARESCE-MASTER §4, Strata definition |
| 3 | **Capacity Before Intelligence** — the Sovereign's constraint is capacity (energy, bandwidth, activation), not intelligence. Systems must route around this | Runlogs §2, ANNEAL-DIGEST-CANON-0X |
| 4 | **Intent-Artifact Pipeline** — value only crystallizes when intent → capture → distill → model → act. Any break in this chain = shelfware | Grand annealment §12, DC-register |
| 5 | **Sovereignty Invariant** — the repo is ground truth; all other surfaces are caches. Coherence = what the repo says | CLAUDE.md invariant 5, Runlogs §8 |
| 6 | **Anti-Shelfware** — accumulated capability without activation energy is zero. Systems must be designed for activation, not accumulation | Runlogs §2 lesson #7, DEC-SOV-009 |
| 7 | **Schema Sovereignty** — only the Sovereign defines/modifies the canonical entity taxonomy. Schema capture = ontological capture = control | PATCH-002, grand annealment §3 |

These 7 are candidates. The clarescence step (Layer 2) determines which survive as true axioms.

### Layer 2 — Nucleic Core Design (The Compiler)

From the surviving axioms, design the minimal coherent core. The core must specify:

**1. Telos** (the terminal condition):
- What is the system FOR? What does "done" look like?
- Current best answer: A sovereign human operating at civilizational scale, with coherence intact.
- The personal Palantir as the architectural form of this telos.

**2. Entity Taxonomy** (the type system):
- Tier 1: invariants (Commitment, Risk, Capacity, Constraint, Identity-level Goals, Relationships, Resources)
- Tier 2: operational (Project, Context, Agent, Tool, Source, Pattern)
- Tier 3: architecturally significant (Memory, Policy/Rule, Health State, Environment/Context)
- Governed Verbs as first-class primitives (from DA-01..07)
- Full spec in ARCH-ONTOLOGY_ANNEALMENT_v2.md §3.5 + PATCH-001

**3. Processing Architecture** (the runtime):
- Cognitive Palace (7 layers: Sensorium through Meta-Agency)
- Modal Sequence (what gets activated when)
- The six chains and their dependency structure

**4. Deployment Target** (the platform):
- Personal Palantir: Semantic + Kinetic + Dynamic + Physics layers
- Sovereign Stack: σ₀ through σ₇

**The core must be claresced before any downstream design proceeds.**
Apply both Paths (18 wisdom lenses + 18 engineering lenses). Score ≥24/36 combined required.

### Layer 3 — Heritage Archaeology

Input: The 5 canon digests (`ANNEAL-DIGEST-CANON-{0X,1X2X,30,31,32-35}.md`)
Method: For each concept class in each digest, apply the Heritage Principle taxonomy:

| Class | Definition | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| SEED | Already a core axiom | Keep verbatim |
| NATIVE | Derives directly from core | Keep, anchor to core, rename if needed |
| HERITAGE | Prescient concept, needs reframing | Excavate, reframe, document lineage |
| VESTIGIAL | Ad-hoc, no longer load-bearing | Document, archive, do not carry forward |
| ARCHIVED | Historically significant | Store with provenance note, remove from active |

This produces HERITAGE-MAP.md — the canonical ledger of old-canon concepts and their fate.

Dispatch: Sonnet agent, reads all 5 canon digests (1,458 lines — within budget).

### Layer 4 — Sources Integration (The Sonnet Unlock)

The 04-SOURCES library (44 research + 42 processed = 86 files) has been "ever on the backburner."
It is now digestible via the proven progressive summarization infrastructure.

**Purpose**: Validate and challenge the axioms. What does external intellectual heritage say?
What thinkers, frameworks, and systems does the canon descend from?

**Method** (same as clarescence/runlogs digests):
- Survey source files → partition by topic/signal density
- Dispatch parallel Sonnet agents to digest batches
- Master synthesis → SOURCES-MASTER-DIGEST.md

This can run in parallel with Heritage Archaeology (Layer 3).

**Key questions to answer from sources**:
1. What external thinkers anticipated the canon's core axioms?
2. What does the sources library add that the canon never captured?
3. What external frameworks (Palantir, Anduril, GTD, Zettelkasten, IIC, etc.) map to which canon concepts?

### Layer 5 — Neo-Scaffold Design

Once the nucleic core is established and heritage mapped:

The neo-scaffold is the **operational layer** — what the Sovereign actually does every day.
It derives from the core axioms, not from historical accretion.

Key design questions:
- Old scaffold has 5-tier task architecture. Does this derive from the core axioms? If so, keep.
  If it's legacy, redesign from first principles.
- What does the Attention Bottleneck (σ₀ axiom) imply about scaffold design?
  The old scaffold was designed for a human PLUS constellation. The neo-scaffold must route
  around σ₀ constraints, not assume they don't exist.
- What is the activation energy minimum? The anti-shelfware axiom demands that every scaffold
  element has a clear path from intent to activation.

### Layer 6 — Neo-Exocortex Architecture

The five-layer exocortex (Sensorium, Ontology of Self, Agency, Sovereignty, Reflexive Intelligence)
is the current model. The neo-exocortex must derive from neo-scaffold + nucleic core.

Key design questions:
- How does each exocortex layer trace to the core axioms?
- What are the interfaces between layers? (Currently implicit — should be explicit in neo-canon)
- How does the constellation fit into the exocortex architecture?
- What does the personal Palantir physically instantiate at each layer?

### Layer 7 — Ontology Convergence Check

The terminal validation: does the neo-canon architecture gradient-descend toward the ontology?

Apply the clarescence dual-path (18 wisdom + 18 engineering lenses) to the full architecture.
Score each layer. Overall combined score ≥24/36 required.

Additionally: verify the software succession test.
- Does the neo-canon move correctness burden from the user to the architecture? (Y/N, evidence)
- Can you derive a coherent concept from the nucleic core without violating the axioms? (Test case)
- Does a vestigial concept fail the core derivation test automatically? (Proof of pruning mechanism)

## The Back-Propagation Instruction

Start from the OUTPUT, trace backward:

**Terminal output**: A sovereign human operating at civilizational scale, with coherence intact,
deploying a constellation of agents that amplify capability across all 28 convergence domains,
with the personal Palantir as the information backbone.

**Trace backward**:
- What does this require at the Ontology layer? → the Palantir semantic/kinetic/dynamic/physics stack
- What does this require at the Exocortex layer? → the 5-layer cognitive prosthesis
- What does the exocortex require from Scaffold? → activation-energy-minimized workflows
- What does the scaffold require from the Core? → a type-safe entity taxonomy + governed verbs
- What does the core require from the Axioms? → coherence telos + sovereignty invariant + anti-shelfware

**Every concept in the neo-canon must be on this critical path or must be explicitly labeled
as SUPPORTING (enablers of critical-path concepts) or ARCHIVED (historical only).**

---

## Cosmological Coherence Requirement

Old canon is domain-organized (content, writing, consulting, systems, health, relationships).
This is administratively convenient but cosmologically incoherent.

Neo-canon must be **cosmologically organized** — arranged by relationship to the fundamental
structure of reality as the Sovereign experiences it:

**The concentric model** (center outward):
1. **Self** — the sovereign's own cognitive architecture, capacity, health, identity
2. **Agency** — the tools, agents, and systems that extend the self
3. **Work** — the output, the content, the consulting, the products
4. **Community** — relationships, collaborators, students, network
5. **World** — the civilizational vision, the convergence domains, the societal impact

Every neo-canon concept belongs to exactly one cosmological ring. This IS its address — not CANON-30300.

## Execution Phases

### Phase 1 — This Session (Opus, MBA)
**Objective**: Produce ARCH-NEO_CANON_METAPLAN.md
1. Read ARCH-GRAND_ANNEALMENT.md + CLARESCE-MASTER-DIGEST.md + RUNLOGS-MASTER-DIGEST.md
2. Run clarescence on the 7 axiom candidates (which survive?)
3. Draft the nucleic core: telos, entity taxonomy, processing architecture, deployment target
4. Design the Heritage Principle taxonomy (SEED/NATIVE/HERITAGE/VESTIGIAL/ARCHIVED)
5. Design the cosmological ring structure (the addressing system)
6. Write ARCH-NEO_CANON_METAPLAN.md — the full blueprint

**DO NOT start building the neo-canon yet. This session designs the design.**

### Phase 2 — Parallel Agents
**Objective**: Populate the metaplan with raw material

Agent A: Heritage Archaeology
- Read 5 canon digests (1,458 lines) + ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS.md
- Apply Heritage Principle taxonomy to all concepts
- Output: `impl/.scratch/HERITAGE-MAP.md`

Agent B: Sources Integration (Wave 1)
- Survey `04-SOURCES/research/` (44 files) → partition → digest batches
- Output: batch digests → `SOURCES-MASTER-DIGEST.md`

Agent C: Sources Integration (Wave 2)
- Survey `04-SOURCES/processed/` (42 files) + `research-notebooks/` (15) → digest
- Output: batch digests → merge into `SOURCES-MASTER-DIGEST.md`

### Phase 3 — Neo-Core Synthesis
**Objective**: Write the nucleic core document

Read: ARCH-NEO_CANON_METAPLAN.md + HERITAGE-MAP.md + SOURCES-MASTER-DIGEST.md
Output: `ARCH-NEO_CANON_CORE.md` — the compiler

### Phase 4 — Neo-Scaffold + Neo-Exocortex + Clarescence
**Objective**: Derive the operational architecture from the core

Read: ARCH-NEO_CANON_CORE.md + HERITAGE-MAP.md
Output: `ARCH-NEO_SCAFFOLD.md` + `ARCH-NEO_EXOCORTEX.md`

Final: Full clarescence validation (dual-path, ≥24/36)

## Context Limit Rules (Carry Forward)

- Opus = orchestrator. <10K token content budget. NEVER reads raw corpus.
- `wc -l` before every Read. >500 lines → delegate to Sonnet.
- Every input to a synthesis agent must be pre-distilled.
- Max ~3,000 total lines per Sonnet agent across all reads.
- ARCH-GRAND_ANNEALMENT.md is 639 lines — delegate to Sonnet.
- Full rules: `~/.claude/projects/-Users-home/memory/context-engineering.md`

## The Design Constraint That Must Not Be Violated

The neo-canon is not a reorganization of the old canon.
It is a generation-skip: new design, inherited concepts, coherent architecture.

**The test**: Can you derive a new concept from the nucleic core without referring to any old-canon
document? If yes — the core is strong enough. If you must constantly look up the old canon
to know what to include — the core is not yet deep enough.

The nucleic core must be self-sufficient. The heritage archaeology then ADDS to it, not DEFINES it.

---

## TL;DR

Session 21 completed the annealment trilogy. ARCH-GRAND_ANNEALMENT.md (639 lines) is the
terminal synthesis. Now: design the spiritual successor. Enter /plan mode. Read the grand
annealment (delegate to Sonnet). Clarescence the 7 axioms. Design the nucleic core.
Write ARCH-NEO_CANON_METAPLAN.md. The neo-canon itself comes in Phase 3-4.
