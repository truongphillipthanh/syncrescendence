## Recommendations

1. **SYN-24 is P0-Critical and stale** — Complete Mastery IIC account email setup hasn't moved in 8 days. This needs Sovereign attention as it likely requires credential/account actions.
2. **Both In Progress items (SYN-51, SYN-53) are unassigned** — Jira and Todoist onboarding are active but have no assignee. Consider assigning to Psyche or Ajna for ownership.
3. **Zero assignees across all 20 issues** — No issues have assignees. Recommend a triage pass to assign ownership, at minimum for In Progress and P0 items.
4. **Backlog IMPL items (SYN-17, SYN-19) are stale cli:openclaw tasks** — These may be candidates for cancellation or re-evaluation given the constellation's evolution since they were filed.
5. **SYN-53 (Todoist) has an active task** — There's a corresponding `-INBOX/psyche/` task for Todoist network fallback. Verify that work is feeding back into the Linear issue.
