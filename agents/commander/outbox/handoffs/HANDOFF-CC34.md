## What Remains
[PreCompact auto-handoff — Claude was mid-task. Check git status and journal.]

## Key Decisions Made
[Auto-generated — semantic context requires manual /session-handoff invocation before compaction.]

## Sovereign Intent
[Check the conversation context — this auto-handoff could not capture Sovereign intent.]

## WHAT THE NEXT SESSION MUST KNOW
- This handoff was auto-triggered by PreCompact. Claude may have been mid-task.
- Check `git status` for uncommitted work.
- Check `agents/commander/inbox/pending/` for pending tasks.
- Check today's journal: `agents/commander/memory/journal/2026-02-26.jsonl`
