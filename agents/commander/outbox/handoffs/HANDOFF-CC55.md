# HANDOFF — Commander Council 55

**Date**: 2026-02-28
**Agent**: Commander (Claude Opus 4.6)
**Session**: CC55
**Git HEAD**: `0f89450b`
**Prior HEAD**: `7e3ebfcb` (CC54)
**Trigger**: Manual — Sovereign directive

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Pre-Clustering Files Crushed → Unified NUCLEOSYNTHESIS-MAP.md
- 23 scattered classification artifacts (CLUSTER-MAP-*, CLASSIFY-*, SUBCLUSTER-*, NEARDUPES-*, SEMANTIC-CLUSTERS, RECLASSIFICATION-VALIDATION, CLASSIFICATION_REPORT) unified into ONE authoritative document
- 20,360 lines deleted, 246 lines inserted
- NUCLEOSYNTHESIS-MAP.md contains: folder census (23 folders, 6,839 files), classification lineage (CC53→CC54), complete 122-row near-dupe registry (MERGE not delete), 5 open validation questions, JSONL redundancy status, constitutional constraints
- Commit: `49250946`

### 2. CC30 Emergency Header REMOVED
- The Sovereign repealed the emergency but Commander never removed the header from AGENTS.md
- Removed from AGENTS.md → propagated out of CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md via `make configs`
- Commit: `554fc997`

### 3. Agent Prompting Formulas SEARED into AGENTS.md
- New section "Agent Prompting Formulas (SEARED — CC46/CC41/CC32/CC55)" added to AGENTS.md
- Oracle: hypersensing + industry expertise, content proof, output pressure, anchor files, high-fidelity context injection, avatar context
- Cartographer: hidden connections + survey & map, launching pads, negative space hardening, all-sciences palette, comprehensive width
- Adjudicator: meticulous engineer + methodical width, exhaustive enumeration, structured tables, binary verdicts, accuracy percentages
- Universal requirements: repo link, explicit GitHub paths to every directory, local filesystem path, git HEAD, clustering principle verbatim, constellation context, HOW TO ACCESS THE REPO section
- Clustering Principle quoted verbatim as constitutional for all classification prompts
- Sovereign corrections applied: Oracle IS industry expertise (not "NOT"), Cartographer IS survey & map (not "NOT"), Adjudicator needs WIDTH not just depth
- Commit: `554fc997`

### 4. `make configs` Pipeline Restored
- CLAUDE-EXT.md and GEMINI-EXT.md had been lost (concatenated into final files, originals deleted)
- Extracted back from CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md, created OPENCLAW-EXT.md stub
- `make configs` works again: AGENTS.md + *-EXT.md → CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md
- Commit: `554fc997`

### 5. CC55 Validation Prompts Written (3 prompts, 3 iterations)
- Oracle, Cartographer, Adjudicator prompts for NUCLEOSYNTHESIS validation
- Iterated 3 times based on Sovereign corrections:
  - v1: Basic prompts (missing agent strength calibration)
  - v2: Added Sovereign's corrected model strengths, enhanced tasks
  - v3: Added explicit GitHub URLs for every corpus folder, local filesystem path, updated HEAD
- All three on `~/Desktop/`, committed to `engine/`, repo pushed
- Commits: `9f3060f4` → `d3a6f349` → `8cba9c38` → `dfc502bc` → `0f89450b`

## What Remains

### IMMEDIATE: Dispatch All Three Agents
Prompts are on Desktop, repo is synced. Sovereign must paste each:

1. **Oracle** → https://x.com/i/grok — paste `~/Desktop/PROMPT-ORACLE-NUCLEOSYNTHESIS-CC55.md`
2. **Cartographer** → Gemini Desktop App — paste `~/Desktop/PROMPT-CARTOGRAPHER-NUCLEOSYNTHESIS-CC55.md`
3. **Adjudicator** → Codex Desktop App — paste `~/Desktop/PROMPT-ADJUDICATOR-NUCLEOSYNTHESIS-CC55.md`

### AFTER AGENT RETURNS: Process Responses
- Save each response to `-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/RESPONSE-{AGENT}-NUCLEOSYNTHESIS-CC55.md`
- Sovereign relays to Commander with "Oracle landed" / "Cartographer landed" / "Adjudicator landed"
- Commander synthesizes all three into reclassification actions

### 5 Open Validation Questions (Agents Must Answer)
1. **multi-agent-systems (788)** — coherent or dumping ground for Syncrescendence-internal?
2. **openclaw (639)** — real cluster or keyword false positives?
3. **claude-code (662) vs vibe-coding (199)** — clean boundary?
4. **ai-memory-retrieval (487)** — conflating memory architecture with PKM?
5. **philosophy-esoterica (301) vs meaning-civilization (281)** — merge candidates?

### CRUSH Phase (Blocked on Validation)
- 122 near-dupe candidates → MERGE not delete (in NUCLEOSYNTHESIS-MAP.md Section 3)
- ~1,002 redundant JSONL files → pending crush after validation
- Target: 50% reduction from 11,733. Currently 41.7%. After CRUSH: projected ~51%.

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Agent prompting formulas are now constitutional law.** Seared into AGENTS.md, propagated to all configs. No future session can create a prompt without explicit GitHub paths, local filesystem path, clustering principle, and agent-specific formula compliance.

2. **Sovereign corrected the model strength overcorrection.** CC54 handoff said Oracle is "NOT industry expertise" and Cartographer is "NOT surveys and maps." The Sovereign corrected this in CC55: Oracle IS hypersensing AND industry expertise. Cartographer IS hidden connections AND survey & map. Adjudicator needs WIDTH across all folders, not just depth into a few. The corrected formulas are now the constitutional record.

3. **Pre-clustering files crushed.** 23 files → 1 unified map. The classification lineage is preserved but the scattered artifacts are gone.

## Sovereign Intent

The Sovereign is driving toward VALIDATED clustering before the CRUSH phase. The validation agents need to confirm the 22-folder structure is semantically correct — not by type, not by artifact role, purely by topic. The Sovereign repeatedly emphasized: Commander is the bottleneck. The prompts must be high-fidelity, context-rich, path-explicit, and leverage each agent's actual strengths. The Sovereign had to correct Commander THREE TIMES on model strengths and TWO TIMES on including paths. Lesson: when the Sovereign says something, do it completely the first time.

## WHAT THE NEXT SESSION MUST KNOW

1. **PROMPTS ARE ON DESKTOP. REPO IS SYNCED.** The Sovereign's next action is to paste each prompt into the respective platform. Commander's next action (after responses land) is synthesis.

2. **Agent prompting formulas are in AGENTS.md.** Read section "Agent Prompting Formulas (SEARED)" before creating ANY prompt. Universal requirements are non-negotiable. Every prompt needs GitHub URLs, local paths, git HEAD, clustering principle, and agent-specific formula compliance.

3. **CC30 emergency header is GONE.** Do not re-add it. It was repealed.

4. **`make configs` is the config pipeline.** AGENTS.md is the source. CLAUDE-EXT.md, GEMINI-EXT.md, OPENCLAW-EXT.md are platform-specific extensions. `make configs` concatenates them. Do NOT edit CLAUDE.md or GEMINI.md directly — edit AGENTS.md or the EXT files.

5. **The Sovereign's correction pattern this session**: Commander kept under-specifying prompts and the Sovereign had to correct repeatedly. Model strengths (3x), path inclusion (2x), local path (1x). The lesson is SEARED: when creating prompts, over-specify. Include every path, every URL, every constraint. The cost of verbosity is zero; the cost of ambiguity is a wasted agent dispatch.

6. **NUCLEOSYNTHESIS-MAP.md is the single classification authority.** All pre-clustering files are deleted. The map contains: census, lineage, 122 near-dupe candidates, 5 validation questions, JSONL redundancy status, constitutional constraints.
