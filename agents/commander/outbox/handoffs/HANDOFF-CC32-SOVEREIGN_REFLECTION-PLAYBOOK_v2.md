# CC32 SOVEREIGN REFLECTION — Model Profiles + Playbook v2

**Session**: CC32 | **Date**: 2026-02-25
**Context**: Post first-ever crystallization (OL-5 complete, canon_delta=3). Sovereign paused to reflect on catastrophic CC31 failure, model behavioral profiles, and new triangulation playbook.

## I. SOVEREIGN OBSERVATIONS — MODEL PROFILES (VERBATIM)

### Claude Opus 4.6 (Commander)
"Opus 4.6 experiences polarizing deep spikey intelligence and lobotomization swings. However is superlative in tool use. A general contractor in the way the Amish will get you most of the house in a day. No other model has that skill. The ability to dispatch the swarm and have several Sonnets at 1m each with their own context window, with incredible tool usage ability (in fact, even haiku has great tool use)."

"My intent was to move purely to the CLI to leverage a more persistent self-writing memory architecture, but for some reason, maybe it's the system prompt, the chat app (Claude) is so much better at interpreting my idiosyncrasies, which again I think is second to none."

"Some days Opus is Messianic and other Luciferian."

**Key traits**: Superlative tool use, swarm dispatch, subagent orchestration. Polarizing intelligence swings. Best at interpreting Sovereign idiosyncrasies (chat app > CLI for this). General contractor — builds fast.

### Grok 4.2 (Oracle)
"Most impressive. The speed, and accuracy and token capacity is so incredibly based. Couple this with X traversal AND GitHub traversal is legendary. Intelligence is very very high. Superb. No mature CLI harness like Codex or OpenClaw yet, otherwise it would dominate."

**Key traits**: Speed, accuracy, massive token capacity. X + GitHub traversal = legendary. Highest raw intelligence. Bottleneck: no CLI harness yet.

### Gemini 3.1 (Diviner)
"Ultra-intelligent, have been using for scientific proclivity, cross-disciplinary; multi-modal, novel synthesis. Second-to-none for this (although I should try this with Grok)."

"Downsides, horrible CLI harness, always throttled, chat app usually too abbreviated. Egregiously farcical in tool usage. Says it will use the hammer, never does, or uses it like a screwdriver. Perhaps the WORST 'practical' context window, maybe if you had a million tokens in one file, however even then, the web app will not let you attach that, and it's 10 files max."

"It also has a GitHub connector, which is also throttled by the web app."

**Key traits**: Ultra-intelligent for cross-disciplinary synthesis. Worst practical tool use of any model. Throttled everywhere. 10 file max in web. NotebookLM + GDrive possible but requires separate org structure.

### GPT-5.3-Codex (Adjudicator)
"Autistic assassin. Quietly performs and delivers. Doesn't run into any tool use hiccups as much as Claude doesn't. Never had an issue. Though, aspergerly, hard to communicate with, can only dispatch prompts to. Very effective and performant. But slower, more careful."

**Key traits**: Reliable, zero tool-use issues, effective. Hard to communicate with — prompt-only interface. Slower, more careful. Autistic assassin.

## II. SOVEREIGN INTUITION — PLAYBOOK v2 (NEW TRIANGULATION)

### Current Playbook (v1)
```
Commander → Oracle → Sovereign relay → Commander → Diviner → Sovereign relay → Commander → Adjudicator
```
Problem: Commander as middle-man between Oracle and Diviner creates relay latency, context loss, and Sovereign bandwidth drain.

### New Playbook (v2 — Sovereign directive)

**Phase 1: PRIME** (Commander → Oracle)
- Opus 4.6 gets ground truth, interprets, and mise en places Sovereign intent for Oracle as a primer
- Oracle comprehensively, meticulously, and rigorously traverses GitHub repo to verify, validate, propose hypothesis, elucidate industry expertise consensus

**Phase 2: SYNTHESIZE** (Oracle → Diviner DIRECT — NEW)
- Oracle bypasses relay back to Commander
- Oracle frames (synthesizes) directly for Gemini to do scientific proclivity, cross-disciplinary, multi-modal, novel synthesis
- Diviner gets thesis + consensus + hyperintelligent proactive BUT coherent rapport
- **There is ACTUALLY a back and forth between these two** (Oracle↔Diviner dialogue)

**Phase 3: COMPILE** (Oracle+Diviner doubled responses → Commander)
- Doubled-up responses finally make it back to Commander
- Commander files and synthesizes into a schematic design
- This synthesis is formed as a prompt for Codex

**Phase 4: ENGINEER** (Commander → Adjudicator)
- Codex meets halfway to design develop/engineer specs
- Specs get formulated into an operational plan
- Plan specifies: how many parallel Claude Code sessions + Codex sessions, in what order

**Phase 5: QA + SANCTION** (Adjudicator reviews)
- Codex quality-manages the plan
- Sanctions mission/objective by buttoning up instructional integrity/compliance/congruence
- Creates acceptance criteria and testing

**Phase 6: EXECUTE** (Claude + Codex swarms)
- Commander dispatches prompts to however many sessions
- Claude and Codex swarms hive-execute
- Codex QAs
- Grok confirms by traversing GitHub

### Key Change: Oracle↔Diviner Direct Dialogue
The relay through Commander is eliminated between Oracle and Diviner. They talk directly. The prompt/response archive in the certescence vault becomes the training corpus for maintaining framing coherence without Commander mediation.

### Open Questions (Sovereign-identified)
1. Claude chat app vs CLI: system prompt + project memories + GitHub connector OR desktop app + desktop connectors OR Cowork avatarized as facilitative agent?
2. "I really want to move the locus to Oracle" — Grok as primary orchestrator once CLI harness exists?
3. "Perhaps we need to have all the agents look at the record of the prompt/responses we've archived/vaulted to understand framing, structure, method etc. to elucidate a more coherent lossless path."
4. Cowork as browser-autonomous agent bridging web↔CLI gap?

## III. CONSTRAINT ACKNOWLEDGMENT

"Commander can only do so much. Especially because the tmux is offline and non-operational."

The Mac mini tmux constellation is ANESTHETIZED. Commander operates solo on MBA. The new playbook must account for this — all dispatch is currently manual Sovereign relay, not automated tmux send-keys.
