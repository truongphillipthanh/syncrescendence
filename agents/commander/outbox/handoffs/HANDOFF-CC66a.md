# HANDOFF — Commander Council 66a

**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Agent**: Commander (Claude Opus 4.6)
**Session**: CC66
**Git HEAD**: `8e84b302`
**Trigger**: Manual (openclaw/ nucleosynthesis complete)

## What Was Accomplished

### CRUSH Nucleosynthesis — openclaw/ COMPLETE

Produced **6 neocorpus entries** from **~70 source files** across the final subcategory (Ecosystem & Comparative Analysis), completing openclaw/ nucleosynthesis.

**Ecosystem & Comparative** (6 entries):
- `openclaw-community-adoption-hype-reality.md` ← 00042, 00043, 00046, 00053, 00281, 10351, 10988, 10990, 11053, 04215, 04329
- `openclaw-competitive-landscape.md` ← 10946, 10983, 10771, 10961, 10638, 04260, 04332, 00098, 00071, 03762
- `openclaw-emergent-agent-behavior.md` ← 10436, 10521, 10531, 03357, 03468, 00195
- `openclaw-skills-platform-economics.md` ← 08327, 08328, 10972, 10963, 10269, 10242, 03903, 10859
- `openclaw-use-case-patterns.md` ← 00056, 00064, 00081, 00251, 10748, 10783, 10877, 10919, 10950, 10401, 10861, 10934, 04050
- `openclaw-architecture-deep-research.md` ← 08435, 08436, 08810, 00259, 03846, 03825, 03735, 00069, 00128, 03417

### openclaw/ Final Tally

**19 neocorpus entries** from **~116 source files** across all 6 subcategories:
- Installation & Configuration: 3 entries (CC64)
- Memory & Personality: 3 entries (CC65)
- Phone & Multi-Device: 4 entries (CC65)
- Security & Cost: 3 entries (CC65)
- Ecosystem & Comparative: 6 entries (CC66)
- Operational Tooling: DISSOLVED (71 files → MAS in CC65)

**Remaining uncovered files**: ~83 (65 extraction atoms = derivatives of consumed sources; 18 source articles = topics covered by existing entries). No uncrystallized concepts remain.

### Reclassification

3 files reclassified from openclaw/:
- 00695 (tmux cockpit for Syncrescendence) → multi-agent-systems/
- 08104 (constellation cognitive division of labor) → multi-agent-systems/
- 10860 (AI consciousness narrative) → philosophy-esoterica/

### Adjudicator Verification Staged

- `engine/PROMPT-ADJUDICATOR-CC66-NEOCORPUS-FIDELITY.md` — 6 entries, 58 source files
- Copied to ~/Desktop/ for Sovereign relay
- CC65 verification response still pending

## What Remains

### Beyond openclaw/ — CRUSH Scaling

21 corpus folders await nucleosynthesis. Recommended order by value/tractability:

| Priority | Folder | Files | Rationale |
|:--------:|--------|------:|-----------|
| 1 | prompt-engineering | 43 | Small, coherent, quick win |
| 2 | ai-biotech | 10 | Smallest folder, instant completion |
| 3 | startup-vc | 80 | Most coherent small folder per concept inventory |
| 4 | claude-code | 323 | Already indexed with 6 subcategories |
| 5 | ai-models | 544 | Largest indexed folder, high redundancy expected |
| 6 | multi-agent-systems | 2117 | Largest overall, contains Layer 3 high-wisdom targets from CC65 |

### Phase 1.5 Reclassification

The concept inventory flagged 30-70% contamination in most folders from bulk ingestion. Before nucleosynthesizing each folder, a reclassification sweep may be needed (especially geopolitics at 60-70% misrouted, leadership-management highest noise). Can be done folder-by-folder as we reach each one.

### Adjudicator Responses

Two verification prompts staged:
1. CC65 (10 entries) — response pending
2. CC66 (6 entries) — newly staged

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Extraction atoms treated as derivatives**: 65 extraction files (03xxx/04xxx) are structured atom extracts from source articles that were already consumed. They don't introduce new concepts — the neocorpus entries were written from the richer source articles directly.
2. **Thin singletons absorbed**: 5 uncovered source articles introduced concepts thin enough to be covered by existing entries (troubleshooting → setup-and-operations, n8n comparison → competitive-landscape, etc.). No standalone entries needed.
3. **3 misclassified files caught**: tmux cockpit and cognitive division of labor were constellation ops, not OpenClaw content. AI consciousness narrative was philosophy.

## Sovereign Intent

Complete CRUSH across all 22 corpus folders, building the compendium. openclaw/ was the proving ground — methodology proven, now scale.

## WHAT THE NEXT SESSION MUST KNOW

1. **openclaw/ is DONE** — don't re-enter it unless Adjudicator flags fidelity issues.
2. **Pick the next folder** — prompt-engineering (43 files) is the fastest win. Or ask the Sovereign.
3. **Phase 1.5 reclassification** should happen at the start of each new folder if the concept inventory flagged contamination.
4. **Adjudicator CC65 response may be waiting** — check `-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/`.
5. **The Layer 3 files** (Syncrephoenix, metabolism thesis) reclassified from openclaw to MAS in CC65 are the highest-wisdom nucleosynthesis targets for multi-agent-systems/.
6. **All pushed** — repo is clean, HEAD is `8e84b302`.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `corpus/NUCLEOSYNTHESIS-MAP.md` | Classification authority + neocorpus progress (openclaw/ COMPLETE) |
| `corpus/openclaw/SUBCATEGORY-INDEX.md` | openclaw navigation (all subcategories nucleosynthesized) |
| `neocorpus/openclaw/` | 19 neocorpus entries (3 CC64 + 10 CC65 + 6 CC66) |
| `00-ORCHESTRATION/state/CRUSH-PHASE2-CONCEPT-INVENTORY.md` | Per-folder concept maps for all 22 folders |
| `engine/PROMPT-ADJUDICATOR-CC66-NEOCORPUS-FIDELITY.md` | Staged verification for 6 CC66 entries |

## Commits This Session

1. `b1313b52` — feat: neocorpus — Ecosystem & Comparative (6 entries from ~70 files)
2. `762fdb32` — refactor: reclassify 3 misplaced openclaw/ files
3. `c98fdc54` — docs: update map and index — openclaw/ nucleosynthesis COMPLETE
4. `8e84b302` — docs: stage Adjudicator CC66 fidelity verification (6 entries, 58 sources)

## Kaizen

- Seared lessons extracted: no new lessons (swarm pattern + extraction-as-derivative principle confirmed)
- Config drift: clean — `make configs` not needed (no AGENTS.md changes this session)
- Memory hygiene: clean — MEMORY.md accurate, no updates needed

## Session Metrics

- Commits: 5 (including this handoff)
- Files changed: ~15 (6 neocorpus entries, 3 reclassified, map/index/verification updates)
- Dirty files at handoff: 1 (this handoff)
