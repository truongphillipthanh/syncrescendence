# HANDOFF — Commander Council 67a

**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Agent**: Commander (Claude Opus 4.6)
**Session**: CC67a
**Git HEAD**: `d1f1beab`
**Trigger**: Manual (3 folders nucleosynthesized)

## What Was Accomplished

### CRUSH Nucleosynthesis — 3 Folders COMPLETE

**prompt-engineering/** (43 → 19 files after reclassification):
- 24 files reclassified (13 misrouted to correct folders, 10 operational → MAS, 1 stub)
- 4 neocorpus entries from 19 source files:
  - `prompt-architecture-structural-design.md` — XML tag taxonomy, 5-layer anatomy, completeness contract
  - `context-engineering-post-prompt-paradigm.md` — system prompts as harnesses, context > prompts, Skills
  - `prompt-optimization-production-rigor.md` — adversarial analysis, caching, Goldilocks, lifecycle
  - `constellation-prompting-formulas.md` — Diviner formula (8 elements), model-specific consensus

**ai-biotech/** (10 → 8 files after reclassification):
- 2 files reclassified (agent memory → MAS, AI investing → ai-capability-futures)
- 2 neocorpus entries from 8 source files:
  - `ai-drug-discovery-protein-engineering.md` — AlphaFold, Eroom's Law, FDA reform, Isomorphic Labs
  - `brain-computer-interfaces.md` — Neuralink N1, BCI bottleneck, neural decoding

**startup-vc/** (78 → 46 files after reclassification):
- 30 files reclassified (6 → ai-capability-futures, 6 → ai-models, 16 → MAS, 1 → vibe-coding, 1 → geopolitics, 1 → design-taste, 1 → product-business)
- 5 neocorpus entries from 46 source files:
  - `vc-strategy-investor-frameworks.md` — A16Z/Benchmark, mega-rounds, AI-era VC
  - `founder-psychology-company-building.md` — Hormozi model, Jobs intensity, efficiency vs optionality
  - `japan-startup-revolution.md` — MPower Partners, cultural shift, regional dynamics
  - `saas-disruption-ai-native-business.md` — SaaS collapse thesis, Skills replacing subscriptions
  - `ai-era-startup-strategy.md` — Moats, enterprise adoption, High Ground strategy

### Session Totals
- **11 neocorpus entries** produced
- **56 files reclassified** across the 3 folders
- **73 source files** consumed into the compendium
- **Adjudicator CC67 verification** staged (11 entries, 73 sources)

### Cumulative CRUSH Progress
- **4 folders complete**: openclaw/ (CC64-66), prompt-engineering/ (CC67), ai-biotech/ (CC67), startup-vc/ (CC67)
- **30 neocorpus entries** total (19 openclaw + 4 prompt-engineering + 2 ai-biotech + 5 startup-vc)
- **18 folders remaining**

## What Remains

### CRUSH Scaling — Next Folders

| Priority | Folder | Files | Rationale |
|:--------:|--------|------:|-----------|
| 1 | leadership-management | ~52 | Small, highest misclassification flagged — quick win after cleanup |
| 2 | ai-safety | 89 | Coherent, moderate size |
| 3 | infrastructure | 96 | Coherent |
| 4 | claude-code | 323 | Already indexed with 6 subcategories |
| 5 | ai-models | 544 | Largest indexed folder |
| 6 | multi-agent-systems | 2117+ | Largest overall, growing from reclassification inflows |

### Adjudicator Responses
Three verification prompts staged, all pending Sovereign relay:
1. CC65 (10 entries) — response pending
2. CC66 (6 entries) — response pending
3. CC67 (11 entries) — newly staged

## Key Decisions Made

1. **BCI stays in ai-biotech/**: The concept inventory scopes ai-biotech to include "brain-computer interfaces." Haiku recon agents suggested a separate bci-neurotechnology/ folder — rejected (no new folders without Sovereign approval).
2. **startup-vc "most coherent" was wrong**: The concept inventory flagged it as the most coherent small folder, but 38% of files were misrouted (30/78). Recon before nucleosynthesis is essential regardless of inventory predictions.
3. **Extraction-derivatives with on-topic content stay**: .jsonl extraction files with substantive prompting/startup content were classified ON-TOPIC per the constitutional routing rule. Only zero-atom stubs and mixed-topic extractions were moved.

## Sovereign Intent

Scale CRUSH across all 22 corpus folders, building the compendium. Four folders complete. Velocity proven: 3 folders in one session.

## WHAT THE NEXT SESSION MUST KNOW

1. **Adjudicator backlog is growing** — 3 verification prompts pending. Consider relaying to clear the queue.
2. **MAS is inflating** — 26 operational/pipeline files moved to multi-agent-systems/ this session alone. When MAS gets nucleosynthesized, expect a massive reclassification sweep first.
3. **Reclassification is the bottleneck** — in all 3 folders, recon + reclassification took more time than nucleosynthesis writing. Budget accordingly for larger folders.
4. **The swarm pattern works** — 3 parallel haiku recon agents + N parallel sonnet writers is the proven dispatch architecture for CRUSH.
5. **leadership-management** is flagged as "highest misclassification rate" — expect 50%+ reclassification. Quick win because it's only ~52 files.
6. **All pushed** — repo is clean, HEAD is `d1f1beab`.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `corpus/NUCLEOSYNTHESIS-MAP.md` | Classification authority + neocorpus progress (4 folders COMPLETE) |
| `neocorpus/prompt-engineering/` | 4 entries (CC67) |
| `neocorpus/ai-biotech/` | 2 entries (CC67) |
| `neocorpus/startup-vc/` | 5 entries (CC67) |
| `engine/PROMPT-ADJUDICATOR-CC67-NEOCORPUS-FIDELITY.md` | Staged verification (11 entries, 73 sources) |

## Kaizen

- Seared lessons extracted: no new lessons (swarm pattern reconfirmed, recon-before-nucleosynthesis validated)
- Config drift: clean — no AGENTS.md changes this session
- Memory hygiene: clean — MEMORY.md updated by Sovereign mid-session (tool-stack-architecture, openclaw-operations topic files added)

## Session Metrics
- Commits: 12 (including this handoff)
- Files changed: ~80 (11 neocorpus entries, 56 reclassified, map/verification updates)
- Dirty files at handoff: 1 (this handoff)
