# HANDOFF — Commander Council 38

**Date**: 2026-02-26T23:45:00Z
**Agent**: Commander (Claude Opus 4.6)
**Session**: CC38
**Git HEAD**: 81eebdf3
**Trigger**: Manual (session completion)

## What Was Accomplished

### First Strategic Reviewtrospective — Full Constellation Synthesis
- **5-agent sequential compounding**: Oracle (thesis validation) → Cartographer (deep trace) → Diviner (theoretical deepening) → Adjudicator (engineering audit) → Commander (orchestration + compilation)
- **3 critical defects discovered** in CC37 build:
  1. **Autoimmune Starvation Trap** (`lattice_annealer.py:548-551`) — threshold tightens when system needs relaxation
  2. **Dimension Blindness** (`candidate_adapter.py:17-23`) — scores 5 operational dimensions, ignores 14-dimension Meaning Taxonomy
  3. **Ambient Paralyzation** (`dag_tension_monitor.py:275-283`) — 1 open node freezes entire tension oscillator
- **Sovereign's Hypergiant Principle** validated by all 4 auditing agents: "fusion not fission — energy expands as things condense"
- **Consensus**: 3 mathematical inversions + 1 new operator fix all critical defects without rebuild
- **Reviewtrospective formalized** as certescence instrument: `PROTOCOL-REVIEWTROSPECTIVE.md`
- **Unified coherence score**: 7.25/10 (Intent 10, Canon 8, Scaffold 6, Sovereign 5)

### Build Status Assessment
- **5/9 DEFECTIVE-BUT-WIRED, 4/9 INERT, 0/9 OPERATIONAL** — pipeline connected, never processed real candidate
- Integration audit (Adjudicator) produced 4 engineering specs with exact file:line locations

### CC38 Artifacts
- Unifying dispatch to all agents (this session's culmination)
- Reviewtrospective protocol committed
- All 5 agent contributions filed in certescence vault: `engine/02-ENGINE/certescence/ascertescence/CC38/`
- Rosetta Stone entry #312: Reviewtrospective (formalized term)

### Infrastructure Actions
- launchd plist installed: `com.syncrescendence.dag-tension-monitor` → `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`
- MEMORY.md updated with CC38 entry

## What Remains

### Prescribed Build Order (CC39 — BUILD session, not review)
1. **P1: Invert threshold** — `lattice_annealer.py` + `CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v2.md` (Adjudicator)
2. **P3: Decouple ambient veto** — `dag_tension_monitor.py` (Adjudicator)
3. **P2: Expand to 14 dimensions** — `candidate_adapter.py` + `lattice_annealer.py` (Adjudicator)
4. **P4: Wire Fusion Operator** — new `fusion_operator.py` (requires Diviner cognitive spec first)

### Agent Dispatch Queue (CC39)
| Agent | Task | Priority |
|-------|------|----------|
| Adjudicator | P1 threshold inversion (own spec, self-test) | IMMEDIATE |
| Cartographer | Verification plan + test candidate identification | IMMEDIATE |
| Diviner | Fusion operator cognitive spec (cluster selection, binding energy, iron ceiling) | STAGE |
| Oracle | X mining on 4 queries (hypergiant, apoptosis, autopoietic, niche partitioning) | STAGE |

### Standing Items
- C-009 (Sovereign bandwidth): ANSWERED
- 3 gated atoms awaiting Sovereign rewrite: `-SOVEREIGN/AXIOMS-CC32-3ATOM-BATCH1.md`
- CC30 scaffold tightening: still unexecuted
- DAG: 5/13 OPEN (62%)

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Reviewtrospective frequency guard**: Max 1 per build cycle. CC39 MUST build, not review.
2. **Build order**: P1→P3→P2→Fusion (Adjudicator's recommendation, adopted without modification)
3. **Hypergiant Principle accepted**: Fusion over fission. Mechanisms survive reframing without rebuild.
4. **All-sciences prompting**: Approved as permanent Diviner policy (not just CC38).

## Sovereign Intent

The Sovereign challenged the build's metaphysical foundation with the Hypergiant Principle: the system should be an expanding hypergiant where condensation releases energy (fusion), not a controlled burn that petrifies (fission). All agents validated this challenge. The build's engineering is sound but its teleology was inverted. Three mathematical sign flips correct the inversion.

The Sovereign wants: working pipeline producing canon_delta. Not more analysis. Build.

## WHAT THE NEXT SESSION MUST KNOW

- **CC39 = BUILD session.** The reviewtrospective moratorium is active. No analysis cycles until after the next build.
- **The 3 defects are precisely located** — file:line in the dispatch. Adjudicator has self-authored specs for each fix.
- **The pipeline has never processed a real candidate.** First end-to-end dry run is the milestone.
- **Cartographer must identify the test candidate atom** — high meaning/philosophical content, low operational vocabulary — from the 606 sovereign_review atoms.
- **tmux constellation is ANESTHETIZED.** Do not attempt tmux dispatch. Use filesystem dispatch or relay.
- **Safe build point**: `77740d01` (CC36). Current HEAD: `81eebdf3` (CC38).
- **The dispatch document** (`-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/` or wherever staged) contains full per-agent briefs. Each agent's section is self-contained with specific deliverables and "the question only you can answer."
