# HANDOFF — Commander Council 56

**Date**: 2026-02-28
**Agent**: Commander (Claude Opus 4.6)
**Session**: CC56
**Git HEAD**: `b7dc773d`
**Trigger**: Manual (Sovereign directive)

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Output pressure seared into ALL agent formulas** — Cartographer (#7) and Adjudicator (#8) now have "exhaust your output tokens / write as markdown file" requirements in AGENTS.md, matching Oracle (#4). `make configs` propagated.

2. **Cartographer prompt fully rewritten** — `engine/PROMPT-CARTOGRAPHER-NUCLEOSYNTHESIS-CC55.md` rebuilt with: all-sciences palette, cognitive launching pads on all 4 tasks, anti-abbreviation mandate, negative space hardening. Copied to Desktop for Sovereign relay.

3. **10 superseded BOTTOMUP-*.md files deleted** from corpus/ (Sovereign-approved).

4. **3-agent validation synthesis** — Read Oracle, Cartographer, Adjudicator responses. Triangulated findings into actionable reclassification plan. Identified systematic Adjudicator error (type-based JSONL routing — constitutionally forbidden).

5. **961 corpus files reclassified across 4 waves**:
   - Wave 1: 115 moves (Oracle + Adjudicator + Cartographer findings)
   - Wave 2: 46 moves (degraded-folder deep audit)
   - Wave 3: 464 moves (medium-folder JSONL content audit)
   - Wave 4: 196 moves (small-folder JSONL content audit)
   - Wave 5: 140 moves (large-folder JSONL content audit)

6. **Clustering principle constitutionally hardened** — "CLUSTERING BY TYPE IS FORBIDDEN" seared into AGENTS.md + NUCLEOSYNTHESIS-MAP.md + all agent configs. Teleology added: progressive semantic tightening toward textbook/compendium.

7. **All 5 validation questions resolved**: Q1-Q4 confirmed coherent, Q5 ruled SEPARATE by Sovereign.

8. **NUCLEOSYNTHESIS-MAP.md condensed into wisdom** — Sovereign directive: deleted classification lineage tables, source maps, detailed Q1-Q5 text. Replaced with distilled Patterns (what works), Anti-Patterns (seared), Boundary Rulings (ratified). Lineage preserved in git history.

9. **4 commits, all pushed**:
   - `1a5eba0c` — 161 reclassifications from 3-agent validation
   - `555f86d3` — scratch file cleanup
   - `44386516` — 800 reclassifications from JSONL audit
   - `b7dc773d` — map condensed into wisdom

## What Remains

- **Near-dupe CRUSH**: 122 candidates identified, adjudicated, registry in git history. Execute merges (preserve unique content into keeper, remove redundant copy).
- **JSONL redundancy CRUSH**: ~1,002 Flat JSONL files are byte-for-byte identical to paired Graphiti JSONL payload fields. Sweep all 22 folders.
- **Projected post-CRUSH**: ~5,700 files (51.4% total reduction from 11,733 originals).
- **Subcategory formation**: Sovereign teleology — folders should develop internal subcategories as coherence tightens.

## Key Decisions Made

- **Type-based clustering constitutionally forbidden** — the single most common classification error. Seared everywhere.
- **philosophy-esoterica and meaning-civilization stay SEPARATE** — Sovereign ruling, Oracle-validated.
- **Lineage purged from map** — Sovereign: "lineage may cause regression into old habits." Detailed source maps and classification lineage tables removed. Wisdom retained. History in git.
- **Teleology seared** — the corpus is becoming a textbook/compendium, not just organized files.

## Sovereign Intent

Build a navigable knowledge architecture — a textbook to build the Syncrescendence. Every file in its semantic home. Progressive tightening: subcategories within folders, metacategories across folders. The CRUSH phases (near-dupes, JSONL redundancy) are next. The classification is now validated by 3 independent agents + 961 reclassifications.

## WHAT THE NEXT SESSION MUST KNOW

**The classification is now solid.** Three independent agents validated, 961 files reclassified, all 5 boundary questions resolved. The map is clean — wisdom only, no lineage noise.

**Next priority is CRUSH** — near-dupe merges (122 candidates) then JSONL redundancy (~1,002 files). Both require content-reading, not filename-matching.

**Current folder counts** are in NUCLEOSYNTHESIS-MAP.md (6,843 files across 22 folders). The uncategorized folder is empty.

**Anti-regression warning**: The old classification lineage is in git history only. Do NOT resurrect detailed source maps or cluster-map tables. The map is wisdom now.

**SAFE BUILD POINT**: `b7dc773d` (2026-02-28, CC56).
