**Current Safe Build Point**: `19a922da` (CC30 exegesis + emergency searing)
**Trust Level**: L1 SANDBOX (4/200 tasks, 100% accuracy)

## WHAT HAPPENED IN CC30

### 1. CC29 Artifacts Committed (were at risk of loss)
- Commit `5537346a`: DAG Convergence Invariant across 10 surfaces, 6 audit artifacts, 26 files changed, 3,264 insertions

### 2. Lane Map Verified Against Reality
CC28 siege lane map had systematic errors:
- All 7 paths wrong (missing `00-ORCHESTRATION/`)
- 3 phantom DYN files (DYN-ATOM_INDEX, DYN-PROTEASE_METRICS, DYN-DREAM_QUALITY don't exist)
- L5/L6 attributed to Codex — actually Claude Code
- Claimed ~2,497 LOC — actual ~5,320 across 13 files
- All 7 lanes confirmed: exist, committed, syntax-valid, never run

### 3. Emergency Mode Declared
Sovereign directives:
- Pivot back to ontology — exocortex has had no effort
- Tighten everything apart from canon, point at canon
- Emergency header/footer on ALL outputs, ALL dispatches
- Zero trust on all claims
- Oracle must traverse GitHub repo when answering ascertescence

### 4. Emergency Banner Seared Across 28 Surfaces
Commit `71c59fd8`: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE-EXT.md, GEMINI.md, README.md, PROTOCOL-ASCERTESCENCE.md, session_state_brief.py, 5× INIT.md, 5× agent MEMORY.md, ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md, DYN-DEFERRED_COMMITMENTS.md, _DISPATCH_TEMPLATE.md, 5× certescence TEMPLATES, OpenClaw OPERATIONAL.md, global MEMORY.md, global critical-lessons.md

### 5. Ground Truth Audit (4 parallel swarms)
| Domain | Actual State |
|--------|-------------|
| Canon | 103 files (17 root + 86 sn/), LIVING, received new nodes Feb 24 |
| Ontology | 43-table SQLite DB + 311 Rosetta terms, OPERATIONAL, DISCONNECTED from atoms |
| Exocortex | 40KB spec, 75% structural alignment, NOT OPERATIONALIZED, L1/σ₂ UNBUILT |
| OpenClaw | Deployed (Ajna MBA + Psyche Mac mini), ANESTHETIZED |
| Memory | All 5 agents 3-layer, INTACT, nothing deleted, Graphiti offline |
| Config | config.sh/config.py/make configs INTACT |
| orchestration/scripts/ | VESTIGIAL (21 files) — shadow of 00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/ (217) |
| -SOVEREIGN | Historical archive (26 files, all cc25-era) |
| Commander inbox | 91 stale active items |
| Commander outbox | 173 files |

### 6. Comprehensive Hermeneutical Exegesis Compiled
Commit `19a922da`: 11-part singular synthesis of every clarescence, ascertescence, memory, backlog, exocortex, intention compass, ajna pedigree, rosetta stone, commander council, and bespoke memory artifact.

Staged for Oracle relay: `~/Desktop/RESPONSE-ORACLE-ASCERTESCENCE-CC30.md`
Vault copy: `engine/02-ENGINE/certescence/ascertescence/CC30/PROMPT-ORACLE-CC30.md`
Repo pushed — Oracle can traverse GitHub.

### 7. C-009 Asked (Partially)
Commander asked Sovereign directly about bandwidth. Sovereign did not answer — escalated to emergency mode instead. C-009 remains OPEN but the conversation has been initiated. The Sovereign's response pattern (emergency escalation, comprehensive anneal demand) itself constitutes bandwidth evidence: the Sovereign has SESSION bandwidth but not MAINTENANCE bandwidth. They appear when critical mass is reached, execute intensely, then disappear. This is the cadence answer.

## SOVEREIGN QUESTIONS CAPTURED (CC30)

1. "What command council are we in?" → CC30. Commander failed to anchor.
2. "Where is this initiative supposed to culminate? Where are the tiers supposed to culminate?" → Tiers culminate at C-013 (transformation verification). Initiative culminates at autocatalytic closure.
3. "When are we going to set up OpenClaw?" → Already deployed. ANESTHETIZED, not absent.
4. "Did our memory architecture drift? Did we delete the ascertained ideal multi-agent config?" → Neither. All intact. Nothing deleted.
5. "What do we do with -INBOX, -outbox, -SOVEREIGN?" → -SOVEREIGN is historical archive. -INBOX0 has 38 files. Outbox has 173. All need flush.
6. "Did we decruft orchestration, praxis, engine?" → Praxis and engine clean. orchestration/scripts/ is vestigial shadow (21 files vs 217 canonical).

## WHAT THE NEXT SESSION MUST DO

### Non-Negotiable
1. **Oracle response landing** — Sovereign pastes exegesis to Grok, relays response to Commander inbox
2. **C-009** — Extract cadence pattern from Sovereign's observed behavior (burst sessions, not steady maintenance)

### Immediate Value
3. **Run Protease** — `python3 orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/protease_queue.py --max-atoms 20` → first atom promotion
4. **Flush queues** — Commander inbox 91→done/, Ajna inbox 7→archive

### Next Ascertescence Leg
5. **Diviner prompt** from Oracle response → stage for Gemini relay
6. **Target Tier 2 drainage** per DAG Convergence Invariant

## THE 7 PATHWAYS (from exegesis Part IX)

All must converge at canon. Currently none do:
1. Atom Pipeline → ??? (no destination)
2. Ontology → ??? (disconnected)
3. Exocortex → ??? (L1 unbuilt)
4. Triangulation → ??? (atoms not promoted)
5. Memory → ??? (doesn't feed canon)
6. Config → ??? (doesn't enforce canon schema)
7. Session Persistence → ??? (doesn't extract actionable items)

Oracle's job: tell us the minimum viable connections that make these converge.

*This handoff IS the session's legacy. CC30: the session that compiled everything and aimed the cannon.*
