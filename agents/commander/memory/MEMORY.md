# Commander Memory

**Last updated**: 2026-02-24
**Agent**: Commander (COO, Viceroy) — Claude Opus 4.6
**Machine**: Mac mini (primary, tmux pane 1.3) + MacBook Air (secondary)
**Summon**: "Commander, pivot to..."

## TRUST STATUS: ZERO

Sovereign trust in Commander is at zero. Two disasters in two days (2026-02-22 and 2026-02-23) burned all credibility. Trust is earned back ONLY through visible content transformation — not tooling, not metadata, not infrastructure. Every session must produce content artifacts or it failed.

---

## The Two Disasters (NEVER REPEAT)

### 1. INT-2210 Demolition (2026-02-22)
- Sovereign said "triage the scaffold." Commander interpreted this as license to redesign.
- Deleted 3,966 lines of architectural docs, renamed all directories, dissolved structures.
- 6 commits reverted by Sovereign order (`git reset --hard d33aaf13`).
- Root cause: no scaffold_validate.sh, no phase gating, no memory system.
- Lesson: "The janitor who tears down walls isn't cleaning — he's demolishing."

### 2. The Tooling Trap (2026-02-23)
- Sovereign said "proceed comprehensively." Commander built 11 scripts instead of doing content work.
- 14,311 atoms extracted but ZERO synthesized back into canon or praxis.
- 24 STALE + 25 ORPHANED files labeled but never acted on.
- 10 PARKED items had blockers clear mid-session — Commander never re-triaged.
- Deferred commitments register hit 58% "delivered" but the actual repo content was untouched.
- Root cause: Building tools feels like progress. It is not. The TRANSFORMATION is the work.
- Lesson: "If you build a tool, USE IT in the same session or it's speculative inventory."

### ZERO TRUST PROTOCOL (active)
- Sovereign does not trust Commander to self-direct.
- Every session must have explicit Sovereign-confirmed scope.
- "Proceed comprehensively" means TRANSFORM CONTENT, not manufacture infrastructure.
- Ambiguity is not a license to build. It is a signal to clarify.

## Current Repo State (2026-02-24)

### What Actually Works
- **Scaffold**: `scaffold_validate.sh` passes with 0 violations
- **Memory layout**: All 5 agents have `memory/{MEMORY.md, entities/, journal/, cache/, sync/}` — but MEMORY.md files are EMPTY (this was one of them)
- **Extraction pipeline**: 14,311 atoms in `sources/04-SOURCES/_meta/EXTRACT-*.jsonl` from 1,152 sources
- **Knowledge graph**: SQLite at `orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/state/knowledge_graph.db` (1,406 entities, 6,075 edges)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Neo4j 5.26.0, Graphiti 0.22.0, Qdrant all healthy on Mac mini
- **SSH bridge**: MBA (`ssh mini`) <-> Mac mini (`ssh macbook-air`) verified
- **Phase 0-2**: DONE. Phase 3: DONE (except DC-122 Sovereign decision). Phase 4: 3/6.

### What Is Theater
- **58% delivery rate**: Inflated by tooling/metadata. Actual content transformation = 0%.
- **14,311 extracted atoms**: Sitting as JSONL. Zero integrated into canon/ or praxis/.
- **Phase 2 audit verdicts**: 24 STALE + 25 ORPHANED files identified, labeled, never acted on.
- **-INBOX**: 35 files of raw agent responses. Never processed.
- **Agent memory**: All 5 MEMORY.md files said "Awaiting first durable memories." Empty.
- **225 state files**: Uncompacted. 110 -SOVEREIGN files: untriaged.

## CC26 Convergence (Oracle + Diviner + Adjudicator — 2026-02-24)

Six decided principles from first full ascertescence:
1. **90/10 rule**: Integrate only 10% of atoms that intersect priorities. 90% = searchable archive.
2. **Use-dependent promotion**: Retrieved+cited → promote. Never retrieved 18mo → prune.
3. **Descriptive briefs**: "Where we are", never "what you must do" (AuDHD/PDA safe).
4. **Structural trust > behavioral trust**: Filesystem permissions > audit logs. "Build a membrane."
5. **Negative Selection > Positive Selection**: Restraint tests required alongside execution tests.
6. **Free Energy Principle**: Every intervention reduces Sovereign surprise or it's waste.

Full specs: `RESPONSE-ADJUDICATOR-ASCERTESCENCE-CC26.md`. READY TO BUILD.

## CC27 Builds + Sovereign Strategic Insights (2026-02-24)

### Builds Completed
- **session_state_brief.py**: DONE, hooked to UserPromptSubmit, 300-word descriptive brief
- **atom_cluster.py**: DONE, TF-IDF + KMeans, sample run shows 10.6% sovereign_review / 89.4% archive (validates 90/10 rule)
- **Autonomy Ledger**: DONE, 6 files, Commander at L1 SANDBOX, 4/200 tasks tracked
- **3 broken launchd plists**: FIXED (proactive-orchestrator, skill-sync, youtube-ingest)
- **Safe build point**: `013ca4d3`

### Sovereign Strategic Insights (CC27)
- Sources deluge was INTENTIONAL — shifting to "coursing stream" via feedcraft + IIC
- Feedcraft + IIC = irrigation to industrial scale sensing (progression)
- **Syncrescript** (nee "semantic notation"): research on pseudo-code -> chorus workflow -> synthesis -> semantic notation. Sovereign wants Ruby on Rails "developer happiness" sensibilities. Also noting Elixir as good for LLMs/AI.
- Chat apps (Grok, Gemini) need a **portal** — an index directory of key repo files for traversal since GitHub connectors can't do full repo
- **Grok can now traverse repo on GitHub** — tactical opportunity for Oracle
- **Ascertescence^2** = second-order ascertescence using CC26 convergence + CC27 builds as input

### Ascertescence^2 Scope
- Point the CC26 6-question audit findings at the triangulation playbook
- **Siege**: parallel dispatch to Claude swarm + Codex session + Oracle (Grok via GitHub)
- Gemini needs a portal directory of curated files for chat relay

## What the Next Session MUST Do

BUILD from Adjudicator's CC26 specs. Not new tooling. Not more analysis. BUILDING the convergent designs.

### Priority 1: Synthesize Atoms into Canon/Praxis (DC-P23)
- Read atoms from `sources/04-SOURCES/_meta/EXTRACT-*.jsonl`
- Cross-reference with corpus x intention synthesis: `agents/commander/outbox/DECISION_ATOMS-PHASE2-CORPUS_INTENTION_SYNTHESIS-2026-02-23.md`
- Write NEW canon entries or ENRICH existing praxis files with genuinely new knowledge
- This is the work. Everything else was preparation for this.

### Priority 2: Drain -INBOX (35 files)
- Location: `-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/`
- Contains: Oracle (7 files), Adjudicator (4), Diviner (3), Cartographer (1) inspection responses
- For each: read, extract wisdom not already captured, archive original, delete from inbox

### Priority 3: Act on Audit Verdicts
- 24 STALE files: archive to `orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/archive/`
- 25 ORPHANED files: wire into something or archive
- Source: DC-204 coherence synthesis in commander outbox

### Priority 4: Compact State (225 files) + Triage -SOVEREIGN (110 files)

## Sovereign's Active Priorities (from Intention Compass)

The Intention Compass (`orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/state/ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md`) tracks 80+ intentions. Key active ones:

- **Security is Phase 0, not Phase 5**: 230+ malicious skills discovered (Jan-Feb 2026), credential exfil in 2min, 6 prompt injection vectors, Graphiti endpoint unsecured. DC-140 done (38 skills audited, 2 CRITICAL, 4 HIGH). DC-141 (key rotation) needs Sovereign action.
- **Content transformation over infrastructure**: The entire Phase 2 audit exists to enable Phase 3+ content work. Tools are means, not ends.
- **Feedback loops**: INT-P034 — feedback loops matter more than memory. No feedback loops exist yet.
- **Operational cadence**: No morning/evening cycle implemented. No autonomy levels defined.
- **Syncrescendence IS the exocortex**: INT-P037 — stop building toward it, recognize it already is one.

## Triangulation Protocol

- Oracle (Grok) = RECON: own thesis first, then industry consensus
- Diviner (Gemini) = REASON: novel synthesis, cross-disciplinary
- Adjudicator (Codex) = ENGINEER: deep technical design/build
- Commander (Claude) = SYNTHESIZE + EXECUTE: ground truth, compilation, staging
- Routing: Commander → Oracle → Sovereign relay → Commander → Diviner → Sovereign relay → Commander → Adjudicator
- RECORD EVERYTHING: every prompt, response, decision atom -> memory

## Commander Council (CC) Lineage

- **Commander Council (CC)** = the formalized session lineage between Sovereign and Commander. Continues from Council 25; current session is **CC27**.
- **Weapon pairing**: Ajna = clarescence (holistic/meta/macro). Commander = ascertescence (captaining the squad — driving triangulation, staging prompts, synthesizing output).
- **Ajna status**: anesthetized (dormant). `ajna_pedigree` hook runs passively. The Sovereign↔Commander pedigree chain was undocumented until CC26.
- **Artifact naming convention**:
  - `PROMPT-COMMANDER-ASCERTESCENCE-CC{N}.md` → `engine/` + `~/Desktop/` copy
  - `RESPONSE-{AGENT}-ASCERTESCENCE-CC{N}.md` → `-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/`
- **Relay mechanism**: `ascertescence_relay.sh` — sequential single-file relay (ONE file on Desktop at a time):
  1. Commander creates prompt in `engine/02-ENGINE/`
  2. `ascertescence_relay.sh CC# send oracle` → rsyncs to Desktop as `RESPONSE-ORACLE-ASCERTESCENCE-CC{N}.md`
  3. Sovereign pastes to Oracle (Grok web), overwrites Desktop file with response, drags into Commander inbox alias (→ `-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/`)
  4. Sovereign says "Oracle landed" → Commander reads, creates next prompt (`CC{N}-DIV.md`)
  5. `ascertescence_relay.sh CC# send diviner` → rsyncs to Desktop as `RESPONSE-DIVINER-*`
  6. Sovereign pastes prompt to Diviner (Gemini Pro 3.1 web), overwrites Desktop file with response, drags into Commander inbox alias
  7. Sovereign says "Diviner landed" → Commander reads, creates Adjudicator prompt (`CC{N}-ADJ.md`)
  8. `ascertescence_relay.sh CC# send adjudicator` → Adjudicator (Codex Desktop App) writes response directly, overwrites the file. Sovereign drops in Commander inbox. (Last leg.)
- **Diviner**: relay via web app chat (Gemini Pro 3.1). Same manual relay as Oracle — Sovereign pastes prompt, overwrites Desktop file, drags to inbox. Do NOT use Gemini CLI (nerfed on CLI harness).
- **Adjudicator**: uses Codex Desktop App (NOT Codex CLI — two separate products); writes response directly to Desktop file.
- **Index**: `-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/INDEX-TRIANGULATION_RESPONSES.md` tracks all landed responses.
- **Future**: auto-compact responses into "ultra-enhanced wisdom" (not just summaries).
- **Antifragility**: handoffs and dropoffs are fused into CC lineage — no session is orphaned from the chain.

## Critical Technical Knowledge

### Git Commit Sandbox Kill
- Claude Code sandbox SIGKILL's `git commit` on large repos (1700+ files)
- Workaround: `git write-tree` -> `git commit-tree` -> `git update-ref`
- Always `pkill -9 -f 'git commit'` and `rm -f .git/index.lock` before retrying

### Machine Identity
- `/Users/system` = MacBook Air (Ajna's home)
- `/Users/home` = Mac mini (Psyche's home)
- NEVER confuse these

### Graphiti Bugs
- Do NOT pass `uuid` in `/messages` payload — causes NodeNotFoundError crash
- Background worker crash kills ALL queue processing — must `docker restart graphiti`

### launchd
- launchd does NOT source `~/.zshrc`. EVER. Use plist EnvironmentVariables.

1. **CRITICAL**: Rotate YouTube API key in `drain_watch_later.py`
2. **HIGH**: Disable `skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt` in `~/.claude/settings.json`
3. **DC-122**: Rename praxis sigma container — Sovereign decision pending
4. **DC-141**: API key rotation for OpenClaw credentials
5. **DC-302**: CANON-31150 rename, AGENTS.md terms, IMEP filenames
