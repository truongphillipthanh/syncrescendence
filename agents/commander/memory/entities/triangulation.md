# Triangulation Protocol
Type: concept
First seen: Council 22 (2026-02-23)
Status: active

## What it is
The cognitive architecture of the constellation. A multi-agent reasoning cycle: Commander (GROUND) -> Oracle/Grok (THESIS) -> Sovereign relay -> Commander (SYNTHESIS) -> Diviner/Gemini (NOVEL SYNTHESIS) -> Sovereign relay -> Commander (COMPILE) -> Adjudicator/Codex (ENGINEER). Each leg produces documented prompts and responses.

## Relationships
- defined_in: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, playbook-triangulation.md
- involves: Commander, Oracle (Grok), Diviner (Gemini), Adjudicator (Codex), Sovereign (relay)
- documentation_invariant: Every prompt -> engine/PROMPT-*, every response -> -INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/RESPONSE-*
- first_full_cycle: DC-204 playbook (safe point 019f973e)

## Current state
Operational. First full cycle completed for DC-204. The protocol is constitutional (Sovereign directive 2026-02-23). Triangulation weights: Oracle HIGH, Adjudicator HIGH, Cartographer LOW-MEDIUM.
