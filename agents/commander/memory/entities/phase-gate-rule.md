# Phase Gate Rule
Type: directive
First seen: Council 22 (2026-02-22, post INT-2210)
Status: active

## What it is
Constitutional Rule 4. No structural changes (renames, dissolutions, reorganizations) may occur without: (a) scaffold_validate.sh passing, (b) memory system operational, (c) rollback tested. Created in direct response to the INT-2210 disaster.

## Relationships
- prevents: Repeat of INT-2210 catastrophe
- requires: scaffold_validate.sh, memory system, rollback testing
- defined_in: AGENTS.md (Constitutional Rule 4), CLAUDE.md
- enforces: Phase sequence (0->1->2->3->4->5), no phase begins until prior P0 items DONE

## Current state
Active and enforced. The most critical structural safeguard. INT-2210 addendum: no surface org without content audit. Dash-prefix dirs are architectural, not cosmetic.
