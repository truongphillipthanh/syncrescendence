## What it is
The human operator (CEO). All authority flows from Sovereign. No work begins without Sovereign confirmation (Invariant 1 — Objective Lock). Sovereign relays triangulation responses between CLI agents.

## Relationships
- commands: Commander, Ajna, Psyche, Adjudicator, Cartographer
- receives_escalations_from: -SOVEREIGN/ async queue
- relay_role: Triangulation cycle (Oracle->Sovereign->Commander->Diviner->Sovereign->Commander)
- machine_presence: Both MBA and Mac mini

## Current state
Active and engaged. The sole human-in-the-loop gate. 126 mentions across the knowledge graph — the most-referenced agent. Reversed the INT-2210 catastrophe via `git reset --hard`. Drives all phase gate approvals.
