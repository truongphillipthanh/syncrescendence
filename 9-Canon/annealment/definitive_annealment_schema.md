  - Timeline: Now through ~2027
  - Technology: GPT-4+, Claude 3+, advanced language models

### B. Operational Frameworks (Not Canonical Dimensions)

These are valuable organizational principles but belong in operational guidance, not cosmos-level taxonomy:

**SCOPE DOMAIN** [3]: Functional Categorization
- **Life Domain**: Personal development, health, relationships, daily practice
- **Development Domain**: Capability building, skill acquisition, framework development
- **Demonstration Domain**: Public output, teaching, content production, value delivery

**Location**: CANON-00006 (Operations) - Section on content/practice balance
**Purpose**: Helps practitioners allocate time across functional categories
**Not Canonical Because**: Operational guidance, not architectural principle

---

**PRIORITY BAND** [4]: Signal Qualification Protocol
- **Immediate**: Consume within 24-48 hours (paradigm shifts, critical updates)
- **Curated**: Queue for weekly synthesis session (high-value, not urgent)
- **Archive**: Reference material, consume when relevant to active project
- **Prune**: Low signal, remove from feed

**Location**: CANON-31100 (Planetary Acumen) - Operational protocols section
**Purpose**: Intelligence mediation and feed curation methodology
**Not Canonical Because**: Tactical triage protocol, not architectural principle

---

### C. Terminology Harmonization Standards

**v2.2 Standard** (Authoritative Reference):
- Practice Level terminology: ALWAYS explicit ("Practice Level 0-3")
- Content Tier references: ALWAYS explicit ("Content Tier 1-4") 
- Stage progression: ALWAYS explicit ("Stage 1-5")
- No ambiguous "Level" references without qualifier

**New Additions** (v2.2+):
- Modal Sequence: ALWAYS capitalized ("Modal 1: Abstraction")
- Scope Domain: Lowercase when operational ("life domain practices")
- Priority Band: Lowercase when tactical ("immediate priority signals")

**Cross-Reference Protocol**:
- All canonical references: Point to current version (v2.2+ unless historical reference intended)
- Historical references: Explicit notation ("as articulated in v2.0")
- Superseded references: Never link to superseded versions without explanation

**Creation Time**: 10-14 hours  
**Account Assignment**: Account 3 (Phase 4)

**Purpose**: Universal practice adaptation principles derived from neurodivergent experience, generalizing to serve all practitioners encountering resistance

   - Temporal sovereignty principles

7. **Practice Modification Frameworks**
   - 30-minute sessions → 15-minute when depleted
   - Daily practice → every-other-day when necessary
   - Formal meditation → somatic awareness when activation high
   - Written synthesis → voice notes when writing resistance present
   - Solo practice → accountability partnership when motivation low
   - Modification permission (framework serves you, not vice versa)

8. **Self-Compassion & Realistic Expectations**
   - Abandoning neurotypical timelines
   - Celebrating actual progress (not ideal progress)
   - Resistance reframing (information, not failure)
   - Comparative suffering avoidance
   - Developmental patience
   - Good-enough as excellence

   - Pulse 5 (Intention Articulation): Clarity before commitment
   - Pulse 6 (Resistance Presence): Resistance as valid signal
   - Pulse 7 (Adequacy Sensation): Self-compassion cultivation

10. **Universal Application Guidance**
    - You don't need diagnosis to benefit from these protocols
    - All humans vary across these dimensions
    - Adaptation is wisdom, not weakness
    - Frameworks should serve practitioners, not constrain them

**Gate Structure**:
1. **Self-Review**: Account responsible for deliverables conducts thorough self-review
2. **Spot-Check**: Another account performs targeted verification
3. **Pass/Fail Decision**: Explicit criteria, binary outcome
4. **Remediation**: If fail, fixes implemented before advancing

**Quality Standards Reference**:
All new artifacts compared to **v2.2 annealed exemplars**:
- CANON_00005_Strategy_v2_2.md
- CANON_00006_Operations_v2_2.md
- CANON_00009_Quickstart_v2_2.md
- CANON-23000-v2-2-annealed.md
- CANON-24000-v2-2-annealed.md

**Minimum Quality Thresholds**:
- Conceptual clarity: Can practitioner understand immediately?
- Operational actionability: Can practitioner execute guidance?
- Internal consistency: No self-contradictions?
- External coherence: Fits with broader corpus?
- Professional polish: Publication-ready quality?

---

### E. Risk Management & Contingencies

**PRIMARY RISKS**:

**RISK 1: Scope Expansion During Execution**
- **Probability**: MODERATE
- **Impact**: Timeline slip, incomplete phase deliverables
- **Mitigation**:
  - Strict adherence to artifact specifications
  - Time boxing per artifact
  - "Good enough" threshold acceptance
  - Document discoveries for Phase 2 (future) rather than expanding current scope
- **Contingency**: If timeline slip >1 week, prioritize P0-CRITICAL artifacts, defer P2-MEDIUM to future phase

**RISK 2: Quality Gate Failures**
- **Probability**: MODERATE (especially Gate 3-5)
- **Impact**: Additional iteration cycles, timeline extension
- **Mitigation**:
  - Quality gates throughout (not just end)
  - Self-review before inter-account review
  - Reference v2.2 exemplars constantly
  - Address issues immediately, don't accumulate debt
- **Contingency**: Buffer time in Phase 5 for discovered issues

**RISK 3: Account Coordination Failure**
- **Probability**: LOW (with explicit protocols)
- **Impact**: Version conflicts, duplicate work
- **Mitigation**:
  - Clear handoff protocols
  - Explicit completion milestones
  - Weekly coordination checkpoints
  - Shared understanding of "done"
- **Contingency**: Account 3 leads reconciliation if needed

**RISK 4: Source Material Complexity**
- **Probability**: LOW-MODERATE
- **Impact**: Longer artifact creation time
- **Mitigation**:
  - Read source thoroughly before writing
  - Synthesize, don't copy-paste
  - Use source material reference system
  - Accept that synthesis takes time
- **Contingency**: Adjust time estimates if material more complex than expected

**RISK 5: Discovered Contradictions During Integration**
- **Probability**: LOW (high corpus quality)
- **Impact**: Requires resolution before proceeding
- **Mitigation**:
  - Quality gates catch early
  - Document contradictions immediately
  - Escalate to human if fundamental
- **Contingency**: Buffer time in Phase 5, human consultation protocol
