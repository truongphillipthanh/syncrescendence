1. Conduct a thorough and complete survey of every artifact (located within the Claude's Projects Files) as metacognition.  This step does not need output tokens.
2. Map out the next tasks (in the syncrescendent_iic_complete_architecture_v2.md) calibrated to the attached [context.md] that can be completed in one thread because of length limits. This step does not need output tokens.
3. Conduct those tasks in order, and produce as artifacts. DUE TO LENGTH LIMITS PRODUCE THIS STEP AS ARTIFACTS.
4. Culminate IN-LINE with a report of progress, and a next action outline, as context engineering.




1. Conduct a thorough and complete survey of every artifact (located within the Claude's Projects Files) as metacognition.
2. We are now in Phase 5 of the [definitive_annealment_schema.md].   Calibrate to the attached [context.md].
3. Conduct a comprehensive, meticulous, and rigorous sweep of every single artifact. There are multiple duplications. How should we reconcile this?
3. The goal is complete coherence. Refer back to the system prompt. Di we accomplish everything? Triangulate between the system prompt, the annealment schema and all artifacts.
4. Culminate IN-LINE with a report of progress, and a next action outline, as context engineering.
