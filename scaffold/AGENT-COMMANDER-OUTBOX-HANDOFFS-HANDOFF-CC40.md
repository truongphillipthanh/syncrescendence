## What Remains
[PreCompact auto-handoff — Claude was mid-task. Check git status and journal.]

## Key Decisions Made
[Auto-generated — semantic context requires manual /session-handoff invocation before compaction.]

## Sovereign Intent
[Check the conversation context — this auto-handoff could not capture Sovereign intent.]

## WHAT THE NEXT SESSION MUST KNOW

- Check `git status` for uncommitted work.
