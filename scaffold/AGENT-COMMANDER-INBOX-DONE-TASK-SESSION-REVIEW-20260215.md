## Sessions Today

No interactive Sovereign sessions logged in DYN-SESSION_LOG.md for 2026-02-15.

**Automated activity only:**

| Time (UTC) | Event | Details |
|------------|-------|---------|
| 05:00-05:01 | Cron: execution-staging check | 3 duplicate ledger entries for `e12005c` |
| 07:01-07:30 | Cron: execution-staging check | 2 entries for `593aeaf` |
| 13:00-13:01 | Cron: execution-staging check | 3 entries for `0fad4ec` |
| 16:00 | Adjudicator: ecosystem_health | Claimed + completed in <4 seconds |
| 19:00-19:01 | Cron: execution-staging check | 3 duplicate entries for `0fad4ec` |

**Commits today**: 3 (all automated Ajna syncs)

| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| `e12005c` | sync(ajna): inbox/outgoing sync from MBA [05:04:25Z] |
| `593aeaf` | sync(ajna): inbox/outgoing sync from MBA [13:02:52Z] |
| `0fad4ec` | sync(ajna): inbox/outgoing sync from MBA [16:04:10Z] |

## Intention Alignment

| Intention | Progress Today | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| INT-1202 — Capitalize on capability window | **Zero human-directed work** | **STALLED** |
| INT-1209 — Temporal intelligence refresh | No activity | Stalled |
| INT-1612 — Begin ALL automations | Ajna sync + adjudicator health checks running. No new automations activated. | **Plateau** |
| INT-1501 — Close 30% autonomy gap | No progress | Stalled |
| INT-1503 — Commander self-improvement | No progress | Stalled |
| INT-1504 — Cascade MBA deployment | Ajna syncs prove MBA→MM pipeline works. No new deployments. | Plateau |
| INT-1601 — Syncrescript adoption | No activity | Stalled |
| INT-1603 — JIT tmux dashboard | No activity | Stalled |
| INT-1604 — Web app memory audit | No activity | Stalled |

## Diagnostic: Execution Staging Health

**Problem**: DYN-EXECUTION_STAGING.md is accumulating duplicate entries. The `create_execution_log.sh` hook fires multiple times per cron cycle (observed: 2-3 duplicates per event). This is noise, not signal. The file now has 137 lines, with ~80% being duplicates of the same commit hash logged at the same timestamp.

**Recommendation**: Deduplicate the hook — add a guard that checks if the current HEAD hash was already logged before appending.

## Analysis

**2026-02-15 was a maintenance-only day.** The system's automated plumbing (Ajna syncs, Adjudicator health checks, cron watchers) ran correctly, proving the infrastructure is stable. But no Sovereign sessions occurred, meaning zero strategic progress on any active intention.

**Drift risk**: This is the 3rd consecutive day (Feb 13-15) where activity has been predominantly automated sync commits. The last substantive human-directed session was 2026-02-14 ~13:01 (5 files, 325 insertions). Before that, 2026-02-13 13:00 (33 files, 1420 insertions — launchd plists). The velocity trendline is: build → configure → idle.

**Pattern**: The system has reached a "infrastructure complete, awaiting activation" state. The automations are running, but they're running the same loops (sync, health check, ledger check) without generating new work. The Constellation is idling at steady-state rather than executing against the backlog.

## Tomorrow's Priority

1. **Sovereign session required** — Without human direction, the system will continue idling. INT-1202 ("capitalize on capability window") is time-sensitive and losing days.
2. **If Sovereign is available**: Execute against INT-1612 (activate remaining automations beyond Ajna sync + adjudicator health). Specifically: Make/Zapier webhooks, Hazel rules, n8n flows.
3. **If Sovereign is unavailable**: Commander should self-direct against INT-1503 (self-improvement) — audit the execution staging deduplication bug, clean up the 30+ duplicate entries, and review stale TASK files in `-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/`.

## Token Economics

- **Interactive sessions**: 0
- **Cron-triggered hooks**: ~12-15 executions (session_log, execution_log, pedigree, intent_compass)
- **Estimated API spend**: <$0.50 (cron hooks are lightweight shell scripts, not API calls; today's review is the only substantive API usage)
