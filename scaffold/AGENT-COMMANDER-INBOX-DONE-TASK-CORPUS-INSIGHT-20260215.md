# Corpus Insight Report — 2026-02-15

**Generated by**: claudecron/corpus-insight
**Status**: PENDING

## Activity Summary
- Commits (last 24h): 4 (all `sync(ajna)` automated syncs)
- Files modified (last 24h): 13 (inbox artifacts, DYN-* state files, adjudicator results)
- Active intentions: 28 (across urgent, sprint, session 16, backlog, and pre-oracle categories)

## Velocity Assessment

**Stalled.** The last substantive (non-sync) commit was `67b5cb6` on 2026-02-13 at 19:47 — "ops: Stage 31 launchd plists". That's **~57 hours ago**. Since then, only automated `sync(ajna)` commits from MBA have landed. No Commander, Psyche, Adjudicator, or Cartographer work has been committed.

The last active Sovereign session (DA-14 blitzkrieg + cross-agent convergence) was 2026-02-12/13. The ledger shows intense activity Feb 12-13 (skills overhaul, ontology enrichment, cartographer reactivation, triple-pass clarescence) then a hard stop.

**Key stalls:**
- INT-1612 ("Begin ALL automations") — P0 urgent, but the INT-1612 automation audit was MISROUTED (Ajna identity config drift, entry 148). Not re-dispatched.
- INT-MI19 ("Palantir ontology") — Last touched Feb 13 (Rosetta Bridge ingest). No follow-up.
- INT-1201 ("self-sustaining by month end") — Marked `failed` (Jan 31 deadline missed). No new revenue target set.
- INT-1504 ("MBA cascade deployment") — MBA Commander reinit was dispatched but no evidence of follow-through.

## Orphaned Work

1. **`engine/MODEL-INDEX.md`** and **`engine/SURVEY-AI_ECOSYSTEM_SURVEY.md`** — Staged (git `A`) but never committed. These appear to be Cartographer output from the model-index refresh (entry 244-256) that got committed as research but these copies may be stale duplicates.
2. **`findings.md`**, **`progress.md`**, **`task_plan.md`** — Staged at repo root (`A`). These are likely session scratch files that violate flat principle and should be metabolized or deleted.
3. **`-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/`** — Contains 16 unprocessed items (TASK-LINEAR-STATUS files from Feb 13-14, TASK-SESSION-REVIEW files, adjudicator ecosystem health results). Commander has not triaged inbox since Feb 13.
4. **`.constellation/state/current.yaml`** — Modified but uncommitted. Constellation state drift.

## Recommendations

1. **Triage Commander inbox immediately** — 16 items including LINEAR-STATUS checks and SESSION-REVIEW tasks are piling up unprocessed. The adjudicator ecosystem health results (Feb 13 + Feb 14) have CONFIRM + RESULT files waiting for acknowledgment.

2. **Re-dispatch INT-1612 automation audit** — The original was misrouted due to Ajna identity drift (entry 148). This is a P0 intention ("Begin ALL automations") with zero progress since the failed dispatch. The 31 staged launchd plists need activation verification.

3. **Clean repo root scratch files** — `findings.md`, `progress.md`, `task_plan.md` at repo root violate structural rules. Metabolize into appropriate locations or delete. Commit or discard the staged `engine/` files.
