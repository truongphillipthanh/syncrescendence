## Blockers / Stale
Issues not updated in >7 days:

- **SYN-35**: Psyche capability encoding (last updated 2026-02-09, 3 days ago) — approaching stale
- **SYN-28**: Metabolize Coherence/ directory (last updated 2026-02-06, 6 days ago) — approaching stale
- **SYN-24**: Complete Mastery IIC account email setup (last updated 2026-02-06, 6 days ago) — **P0-Critical, approaching stale**
- **SYN-17**: IMPL-A-0013 FDIS requirements (last updated 2026-02-06, 6 days ago) — approaching stale
- **SYN-19**: IMPL-A-0015 Token/cost burn (last updated 2026-02-06, 6 days ago) — approaching stale

## Recommendations
1. **SYN-24 needs immediate attention** — P0-Critical issue approaching stale with no assignee. Email setup is a blocking dependency for IIC operations.
2. **Assign the In Progress items** — SYN-51 and SYN-53 (Jira/Todoist onboarding) are both In Progress but unassigned. Assign owners to ensure accountability.
3. **PM tool onboarding cluster** (SYN-51/52/53/54) could benefit from a single coordinated sprint rather than parallel ad-hoc progress.
4. **Backlog triage needed** — SYN-17, SYN-19, SYN-28 are marked Urgent priority but sitting in Backlog. Either promote to Todo or deprioritize to resolve the contradiction.
5. **All 20 issues are unassigned** — consider assigning at least the In Progress and P0 items to drive ownership.
