**Generated by**: claudecron/corpus-insight
**Status**: PENDING

## Activity Summary
- Commits (last 24h): 73
- Files modified (md): 68
- Active intentions (urgent): 4
- Active intentions (sprint+session): ~24

## Velocity Assessment

**Exceptional burst.** 73 commits in 24h represents the highest single-day commit volume observed. Work concentrated in three lanes:

1. **PROJ-006b Ontology (INT-MI19)** — Progressing. Junction tables populated, primitives expanded 10→45, Palantir ontology chorus coalescence completed. This is the "FINAL BOSS" intention and is receiving sustained attention.

2. **SaaS Integrations (SYN-51/53/55, INT-1612)** — Jira v2.0, Todoist, Airtable MCP servers installed and integration docs formalized. Directly serves INT-1612 ("Begin ALL automations"). Good alignment.

3. **claudecron Sensing (SYN-31)** — Phase 2 deployed with 3 sensing tasks wired to launchd. This report is itself evidence of the pipeline working. Serves INT-1612.

4. **Clarescence Operations** — Multiple clarescence passes executed (session orientation, ontology metacharacterization, operational recalibration). Meta-alignment work.

**Stalled intentions:**
- **INT-1201** (revenue by month end) — Status: `failed`. No commits addressing revenue generation or account sustainability. No reset target from Sovereign.
- **INT-1602** (IIC Google ecosystem pipeline) — No recent commits.
- **INT-1605** (NotebookLM research architecture) — No recent commits.
- **INT-1606** (Discord + Slack for OpenClaw) — No recent commits.
- **INT-1608/1609** (Apple Notes, YouTube/X extraction) — No recent commits.
- **INT-1616** (LifeOS/PKM convergence) — `pending` in captures, no work started.

## Orphaned Work

- **`-INBOX/commander/new_ontology_metacharacterization/`** — 5 files (chatgpt.md, palantir_ontology_choral_prompt.md, gemini.md, claude.md, grok.md) modified but unclear if they map to a tracked task. Likely PROJ-006b adjacent, but no explicit TASK file governs this work.
- **Ajna sync commits** (4 in 24h) — Coordination overhead. Not orphaned per se, but represents ~5% of commit volume as pure sync rather than value-producing work.
- **Global Ledger stale** — Last entry is 2026-02-10T07:59:37. No entries for today's 73 commits. The ledger append pipeline is not firing for most work.

## Recommendations

1. **Triage INT-1201 (revenue)** — The failed revenue intention is the highest-stakes item on the compass. Sovereign needs to either set a new target or explicitly defer. This is the only `failed` urgent intention and it's eroding signal quality.

2. **Fix Global Ledger pipeline** — DYN-GLOBAL_LEDGER.md has only 6 entries total despite 73 commits today. Either `append_ledger.sh` isn't wired to hooks, or dispatched work bypasses it. Without ledger events, the audit trail breaks Invariant 3 (Receipts).

3. **Formalize ontology metacharacterization** — The `-INBOX/commander/new_ontology_metacharacterization/` folder contains multi-platform choral outputs that should be governed by a TASK file and linked to PROJ-006b/INT-MI19. Create the task or move artifacts to their canonical location.
