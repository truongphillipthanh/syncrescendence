## Objective

Audit the 236 canonical skills at ~/.agents/skills/ for security concerns. Per /last30days intelligence (2026-02-12), 17-20% of ClawHub ecosystem may contain malicious content. For each skill, review SKILL.md for: (1) scripts executing arbitrary commands or curl/wget to unknown endpoints; (2) external API calls to unknown or suspicious endpoints; (3) credential exfiltration patterns (reading .env, API keys, tokens); (4) prompt injection vectors in instructions that could override agent safety; (5) filesystem operations outside expected scope. Produce a security report with: QUARANTINE list (immediate threat), FLAGGED list (needs review), CLEARED list (safe). Priority: Trail of Bits skills (likely safe, known provenance) → CEK skills (moderate trust) → vibeship/community skills (lowest trust). Include specific evidence for any quarantine recommendation.
