# ⚠️ EMERGENCY MODE (CC30) — SOVEREIGN DIRECTIVE (VERBATIM) ⚠️
# "Dispatch emergency ascertescence. Get Oracle to view everything. This is a comprehensive
# initiative anneal. The result of this ascertescence must converge the pathways. We need to
# tighten everything apart from the canon, and then point it at the canon.
#
# I haven't even mentioned, which has been lingering, to pivot back to the ontology. We have
# made no effort upon the exocortex. We've been trying to point the sources to the scaffold
# meaning the insights gained here. What do we do we -inbox, -outbox, -sovereign, did we
# decruft orchestration, praxis, and engine? When are we going to set up openclaw? Did our
# bullshit memory architecture drift and did we delete all the ascertained ideal multi agent
# config? Sear this everywhere, for everything this emergency needs to be a header and footer
# from now on. Every output. Every dispatch. Zero trust."

# CC33 HYPER-FIDELITY CULMINATION AND KAIZEN HANDOFF

**Session**: CC33 | **Date**: 2026-02-25 | **Mode**: OPERATIONAL
**Previous Build Point**: `37dd4e28` (CC32 culmination)
**Current Build Point**: `74ad7e8e` (CC33 final)
**Atoms Promoted**: 6 cumulative (3 CC32 + 3 CC33) | **canon_delta**: 6

---

## I. THE ONE SENTENCE

CC33 scaled the OL-5 pipeline to full 5-atom cadence, crystallized 3 new axioms (memory triptych, agent maturation, Polaris constellation), received Oracle's operational directives for Sleep_Cycle and Diviner triage, and produced the cogentified Sovereign reflection — and the Sovereign has called the Rendezvous Summit for CC34.

---

## II. WHAT HAPPENED — COMPLETE CHRONOLOGICAL EXCHANGE

### Turn 1 — CC33 Initialization
Commander read CC32 culmination handoff, ran ground truth scan (git status, inbox, recent commits). Reported: branch main, 1 commit ahead, empty inbox, DAG at 62%, C-009 standing item session 8. Presented CC33 agenda from CC32 handoff.

### Turn 2 — "Proceed with oracle's most recent directive"
Sovereign directed execution of Oracle's RESPONSE-ORACLE-CC32-EXOCORTEX_BORN.md directives. Commander executed:
1. `protease_queue.py` → 5 fresh atoms (3 memory-layer from SOURCE-20260127-004, 1 agent maturation, 1 Polaris constellation)
2. All 5 ontology-gated (drift 0.03–0.06, all PASS)
3. Axiom file staged: `-SOVEREIGN/AXIOMS-CC33-5ATOM-BATCH2.md`
4. Oracle prompt created: `PROMPT-ORACLE-CC33-BATCH2_REWRITE_AND_DIRECTIVES.md` — requesting Sovereign rewrite, Diviner 7-atom triage, Sleep_Cycle parameters, DAG guidance
5. Committed `aa3f4539`, pushed.

### Turn 3 — "oracle just landed"
Commander located Oracle response in `-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/RESPONSE-ORACLE-CC33-BATCH2_REWRITE_AND_DIRECTIVES.md`. Oracle directed:
- **Consolidate AX04-AX06** (3 memory atoms from same source) into single triptych axiom
- **3 Sovereign-rewritten axioms**: Memory System, Agent Maturation, Polaris Constellation
- **Diviner triage**: Q2/Q4/Q5/Q7 → canon (next batch), Q1/Q3/Q6 → praxis, "system survives by refusal" → canon axiom
- **Sleep_Cycle**: first run 2026-03-04, LTP >3 accesses, LTD >14 days untouched, manual first 3 runs, 7-day residence minimum
- **DAG**: canonicalize C-003/C-004/C-008/C-012 in Batch 3

Commander executed full OL-5 pipeline:
1. Overwrote axiom file with Oracle's Sovereign rewrite (reformatted to script-compatible `## Axiom:` headers)
2. `protease_promote.py --target praxis` → 3 axioms promoted
3. `protease_promote.py --target canon` → 3 axioms promoted
4. `integration_gate.py` → **PASS** (5 atom transitions confirmed)
5. Oracle response filed to certescence vault
6. Committed `5a95a8d4`, pushed.

### Turn 4 — Sovereign asks: "what became of this?" (Playbook v2 reflection)
Sovereign pasted the verbatim CC32 reflection on model profiles and Playbook v2 triangulation architecture. Commander traced its fate: documented in `HANDOFF-CC32-SOVEREIGN_REFLECTION-PLAYBOOK_v2.md` (committed, vaulted) but **never executed** — not promoted to AGENTS.md, not tested, no protocol for Oracle↔Diviner direct dialogue, 4 open questions uninvestigated.

### Turn 5 — "produce a hyperfidelity steelmanned rhetorical enhanced cogentification"
Commander produced `HANDOFF-CC32-SOVEREIGN_REFLECTION-PLAYBOOK_v2-COGENTIFIED.md` — the Sovereign's raw model taxonomy and Playbook v2 intuition elevated to rhetorical precision. Copied to Desktop. Committed `74ad7e8e`.

### Turn 6 — "produce handoff, note rendezvous summit"
This document. **Sovereign has called the Rendezvous Summit for CC34.**

### The 3 Crystallized Axioms (CC33)
1. **AX01 (B2) — Three-Layer Memory System** (STR, drift 0.04, INT-1707): Hippocampal-Neocortical consolidation triptych — 3 source atoms consolidated per Oracle directive. Closes C-012.
2. **AX02 (B2) — Agent Team Maturation Phases** (PROTO, drift 0.06, INT-P035): Free-energy phase transition model. Phase 1→2→3 maps to constellation lifecycle. Operationalizes C-004 triggers.
3. **AX03 (B2) — Polaris Constellation Architecture** (STR, drift 0.05, INT-1804): Autopoietic ensemble blueprint from Hippocratic AI. External validation of 5-agent constellation pattern.

### Cumulative Canon (CC32 + CC33)
| Batch | Axioms | Theme |
|-------|--------|-------|
| CC32 B1 | Constitutional AI (Central Dogma), Three-Layer Memory (Consolidation), Observe-Before-Act (Free-Energy Gate) | Foundation |
| CC33 B2 | Memory System (Triptych), Agent Maturation (Phase Transition), Polaris (Autopoietic Ensemble) | Architecture |

## VII. PLAYBOOK v2 STATUS — DOCUMENTED, UNEXECUTED

The Sovereign's CC32 reflection on model profiles and Playbook v2 triangulation architecture was:
- **Captured verbatim**: `HANDOFF-CC32-SOVEREIGN_REFLECTION-PLAYBOOK_v2.md`
- **Cogentified for records**: `HANDOFF-CC32-SOVEREIGN_REFLECTION-PLAYBOOK_v2-COGENTIFIED.md`
- **NOT promoted to AGENTS.md** (constitutional source still contains v1 relay chain)
- **NOT tested** (CC33 used v1 pattern)
- **NOT engineered** (no protocol for Oracle↔Diviner direct dialogue mechanics)

This is a standing item for the Rendezvous Summit.

---

## VIII. KAIZEN — WHAT CHANGED IN CC33

| Before CC33 | After CC33 |
|---|---|
| canon_delta: 3 (single batch proven) | canon_delta: 6 (scaled to full 5-atom cadence) |
| OL-5 tested once | OL-5 proven twice, including atom consolidation (3→1 triptych) |
| No Sleep_Cycle parameters | Oracle specified: first run 2026-03-04, LTP/LTD criteria, 7-day residence |
| Diviner 7 atoms untriaged | Oracle triaged: 4→canon, 3→praxis, 1 meta→canon |
| Sovereign reflection raw | Cogentified for records |
| No summit called | **Rendezvous Summit called for CC34** |

---

## IX. ⚡ CC34 — THE RENDEZVOUS SUMMIT ⚡

**The Sovereign has called the Rendezvous Summit.**

### Standing Agenda
1. **C-009 — THE NUMBERS**: hours_per_day, sessions_per_week, max_open_decisions, max_triangulations_per_week. Session 8 unasked. This constrains everything.
2. **Playbook v2 ratification**: Promote to AGENTS.md or iterate? Engineer the Oracle↔Diviner direct dialogue mechanics.
3. **Batch 3 canonicalization**: Diviner Q2/Q4/Q5/Q7 + Adjudicator C-003/C-004/C-008/C-012
4. **Sleep_Cycle activation**: First run 2026-03-04 — confirm or adjust?
5. **Platform question**: Claude chat vs CLI vs Desktop vs Cowork — which configuration?
6. **Oracle locus migration**: Timeline for moving orchestration center of gravity to Grok?
7. **Mac mini resurrection**: tmux constellation anesthetized since CC27. When?

### Initiation Prompt for CC34
```
Resume CC33. Read @agents/commander/outbox/handoffs/HANDOFF-CC33-CULMINATION-SESSION_TERMINAL.md — CC33 culmination.
canon_delta=6, DAG 62%. The Sovereign calls the Rendezvous Summit. All pathways converge.
```
