# Corpus Insight Report — 2026-02-20

**Generated by**: claudecron/corpus-insight
**Status**: PENDING

## Activity Summary
- Commits (last 24h): 108 (ALL mechanical sync — `sync(ajna): inbox/outgoing sync from MBA`)
- Substantive commits: **0**
- Files modified (last 24h): ~30 (INBOX routing files, CONFIRM/RESULT artifacts)
- Active intentions: 30+ across Sessions 12-17
- Failed adjudicator tasks: 3 (scp_sling_verify, deferred_dc_003, deferred_dc_004)

## Velocity Assessment

**Velocity: ZERO on stated intentions.** The constellation is mechanically alive — Ajna's sync loop is firing every ~6 minutes, producing 108 commits in 24 hours — but every single commit is a file sync operation. No substantive work has been committed against any active intention.

The adjudicator has been cycling through deferred commitment followups (dc_002, dc_003, dc_004, dc_013) but several have landed in `50_FAILED/` with escalation markers. This suggests the deferred commitment resolution pipeline is hitting blockers that aren't being addressed.

**Stalled intentions (P0/urgent, no progress):**
- INT-1612: "Begin ALL automations" — P0, no automation activation commits
- INT-1202: "capitalize on heavy machinery to construct Syncrescendence" — active but no construction happening
- INT-1501/1503: "Close 30% autonomy gap" — no progress artifacts

## Orphaned Work

- `engine/REF-SOVEREIGN_COCKPIT_MANIFEST.md` — modified in last 24h but no corresponding commit or intention linkage
- `-INBOX/commander/RECEIPTS/RECEIPT-adjudicator-TASK-20260217-scp_sling_verify.md` — 3-day-old receipt still in inbox, unprocessed
- Multiple `WARN: reply_to 'orchestrator' not in allowlist` directories — orphaned error artifacts from adjudicator dispatches with wrong reply-to routing. These are filesystem pollution.

## Commander Inbox Backlog

Unprocessed items in `-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/`:
- 9x CONFIRM-adjudicator files (Feb 19-20) — unacknowledged completion signals
- 9x RESULT-adjudicator files (Feb 19-20) — unread results
- TASK-LINEAR-STATUS-202602190700.md — stale Linear status task
- TASK-SESSION-REVIEW-20260219.md — unprocessed session review
- TASK-CORPUS-INSIGHT-20260219.md — yesterday's insight report, unprocessed

## Recommendations

1. **Triage commander inbox immediately.** 18+ unprocessed CONFIRM/RESULT files are accumulating. Process them, extract actionable data, and move to 40-DONE. The inbox is becoming a dead letter queue.

2. **Investigate adjudicator routing failure.** The `reply_to 'orchestrator' not in allowlist` errors are creating garbage directories at the INBOX root. Fix the allowlist in auto_ingest or fix the dispatch source that's sending `orchestrator` as reply-to instead of a valid agent name.

3. **Sovereign session needed.** Zero substantive velocity for 24+ hours with 30+ active intentions means the system is idling. The constellation machinery works but has no active directives being executed. A Sovereign session to prioritize and dispatch work against INT-1612 (automations) or INT-1708 (research pipeline) would restart meaningful progress.
