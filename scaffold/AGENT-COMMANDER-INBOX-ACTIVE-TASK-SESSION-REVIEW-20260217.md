## Sessions Today

The day ran across 5 logged execution staging sessions, all SUCCESS, spanning 19:59–20:13 UTC. However, the global ledger shows continuous activity from ~00:02 to ~20:13 UTC — a full 20-hour operational day driven primarily by automated sync loops, heartbeat commits, and agent dispatches.

| Time Block (UTC) | Key Activity | Agent(s) |
|---|---|---|
| 00:00–02:30 | Resilience hardening: FileVault disable, autoboot config, heartbeat stabilization, unplug recovery coordination | Commander, Psyche, Adjudicator |
| 02:30–04:00 | Adversarial unplug recovery audit, targeted 7-blocker hardening | Adjudicator (CQO), Psyche (CTO) |
| 04:00–06:15 | Neural Bridge genetic embedding (MBA side), SCP-back verification, adversarial audit v2, launchd env propagation | Commander, Psyche, Adjudicator, Cartographer |
| 06:15–10:15 | Auto-ingest supervisor deployment, heartbeat monitoring cadence (6 heartbeat commits) | Commander (automated) |
| 10:15–17:00 | Ajna sync loop running continuously (~5min cadence), no substantive human-directed commits | Ajna (automated) |
| 17:00–20:15 | Sync bomb recovery, repo restoration, macOS compatibility fix, commander reinit (37 CONFIRMs + 9 RESULTs + 4 TASKs), ontology annealment v1, session 20 reinit | Commander |

## Analysis

### What worked
- **Resilience hardening was the day's dominant theme** and was executed well: FileVault disabled, autoboot configured, unplug recovery chain verified end-to-end with adversarial audit.
- **Neural Bridge achieved production-grade status**: genetic embedding on MBA, SCP routing verified, launchd env propagation fixed, watchdog SSH health checks operational.
- **Sync bomb recovery** at ~17:00 UTC was handled autonomously without sovereign intervention — strong signal for INT-1501 (autonomy gap closure).
- **Multi-agent coordination** was active: Commander dispatched to Psyche, Adjudicator, and Cartographer; CONFIRMs routed back cleanly.

### What didn't
- **~70% of commits were automated sync/heartbeat noise** — the Ajna 5-min sync cadence produces ~288 commits/day. This pollutes git history and the global ledger. Consider: git-sync dedup, squash-on-merge, or longer cadence.
- **No progress on INT-1206 (IIC configs), INT-1601–1603 (Syncrescript, IIC pipeline, HighCommand)** — these are sprint-level intentions that have been stalled for multiple days.
- **Session 20 reinit + handoff sequence** had 3 fix commits in rapid succession (anti-pattern #9, wrong path, git-deletion warning) — indicating the handoff protocol still has friction.

## Tomorrow's Priority

1. **Address sync noise**: The 5-min Ajna sync cadence is producing unsustainable commit volume. Either increase interval to 15-30min or implement dedup logic.
2. **INT-1206 / IIC configs**: This sprint intention has been active since Oracle 11 with no recent progress. Either execute or explicitly defer with rationale.
3. **Session 20 handoff polish**: The 3 rapid-fire fixes suggest the annealment/reinit protocol needs one more pass to stabilize.
4. **SOVEREIGN escalation check**: 80+ ALERT files accumulated in -SOVEREIGN/ — many appear to be commander watchdog alerts from the 14:33–16:56 UTC window. Needs triage and cleanup.

## Token Economics

- ~5 Commander sessions logged in execution staging
- ~3 agent dispatches (Psyche x2, Adjudicator x1, Cartographer x1 implicit)
- Estimated API spend: moderate-to-heavy day. Commander sessions + Psyche/Adjudicator shared pool usage + continuous Ajna sync loops. Likely $15-25 in aggregate API costs across all agents/models.
- Risk: Psyche + Adjudicator share ChatGPT Plus capacity pool — simultaneous dispatches today may have caused queuing.
