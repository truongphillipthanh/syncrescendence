This task is addressed to **Ajna** (Mac mini host), not me (Psyche on MacBook Air). The header shows "Claimed-By: ajna-Lisas-MacBook-Air" which is incorrect — Ajna executes on the Mac mini (`home` host).

**Status**: Misrouted task — Ajna audit requires Mac mini execution surface.

**Action**: Queued for Ajna pickup on correct host. Psyche continues with synaptical automation discovery (in-progress task).
