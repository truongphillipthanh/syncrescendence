## Blockers / Stale
Issues not updated in >7 days:

- **SYN-35**: Psyche capability encoding — last updated 2026-02-09 (3 days — approaching stale)
- **SYN-28**: Metabolize Coherence/ directory — last updated 2026-02-06 (6 days — approaching stale)
- **SYN-24**: Complete Mastery IIC account email setup — last updated 2026-02-06 (6 days — **P0-Critical, approaching stale**)
- **SYN-17**: IMPL-A-0013: Triangulate FDIS requirements — last updated 2026-02-06 (6 days)
- **SYN-19**: IMPL-A-0015: Token/cost burn management — last updated 2026-02-06 (6 days)

## Recommendations

1. **SYN-24 is P0-Critical and stale** — "Complete Mastery IIC account email setup" hasn't been updated in 6 days. This needs immediate Sovereign attention or delegation.
2. **No assignees on any issue** — All 20 active issues are unassigned. Consider assigning the In Progress items (SYN-51, SYN-53) at minimum to track ownership.
3. **SYN-51 + SYN-53 are the active front** — Both PM tool onboarding tasks (Jira, Todoist) were updated yesterday. These appear to be the current execution lane.
4. **High-priority Todo cluster** — 8 issues at P2-High in Todo state. Consider promoting 1-2 to In Progress to maintain throughput, particularly SYN-43 (Terminal Cascade Machine Sync) and SYN-40 (JIT HighCommand Tmux Dashboard) which are infrastructure enablers.
5. **Backlog hygiene** — SYN-17 and SYN-19 (IMPL-A items) haven't moved since Feb 6. Evaluate whether these should be deferred/canceled or given a concrete next action.
