## Recommendations
1. **SYN-24 (P0-Critical)** is nearly stale with no assignee — this needs immediate triage or reassignment given its critical label.
2. **SYN-51 and SYN-53** are both In Progress but unassigned — assign owners to ensure accountability on active work.
3. **SYN-28** (Coherence metabolization) has been idle since Feb 6 — consider dispatching to Cartographer for corpus-scale processing.
4. All 20 issues are unassigned — consider a bulk assignment pass to distribute ownership across the constellation.
5. The SaaS onboarding cluster (SYN-51/52/53/54) could benefit from sequencing: complete Todoist+Jira first, then cascade to Trello+TeamGantt.
