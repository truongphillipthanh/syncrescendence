# TEMPLATE: ASCERTESCENCE
## Fill-in-the-Blanks Template for Triangulation Playbook Input

**Template Version**: 1.0.0
**Protocol Reference**: `engine/02-ENGINE/PROMPT-CERTESCENCE-PROTOCOL.md`
**File Semantics**: DYN- (living artifact — fill and save as new file per cycle)

**Usage**: Copy this file. Rename to `ASCERTESCENCE-<COUNCIL_NUMBER>-<DATE>.md`. Fill every `___` blank. The completed artifact becomes the Commander staging document for the triangulation playbook.

## HEADER

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Session ID** | `SESSION-___` |
| **Council Number** | `Council ___` |
| **Date** | `____-__-__` |
| **Invoked By** | `___ (Sovereign / Commander / auto-trigger)` |
| **Scope** | `___ (immediate / phase / horizon / strategic / existential)` |
| **Flavor** | `___ (see Flavor Detection section below)` |
| **Cycle Count for This Flavor** | `___ (increment per recurrence)` |
| **Previous Ascertescence** | `___ (file reference or "none")` |
| **Convergence Delta from Last** | `___ (new nodes / resolved nodes / same)` |

---

## FLAVOR DETECTION

Identify what kind of ascertescence this is before proceeding. Circle one. If **groundhog-day** appears more than twice in session history, skip the rest of this template and escalate directly to Sovereign (see Forward-Looking Guard).

| Flavor | Trigger Signature | Active? |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| **phase-transition** | Phase register and evidence diverge; unclear what phase we are in | `[ ]` |
| **scope-explosion** | Current directive or decision touches >5 domains simultaneously | `[ ]` |
| **trust-recovery** | Previous execution diverged from Sovereign intent; damaged confidence | `[ ]` |
| **strategic-inflection** | New information invalidates prior architectural assumptions | `[ ]` |
| **periodic-audit** | Scheduled health check (weekly / monthly / post-Council) | `[ ]` |
| **groundhog-day** | Same convergence nodes surfacing as prior ascertescence cycle | `[ ]` |

**Selected Flavor**: `___`

**Flavor Justification** (one sentence): `___`

> If groundhog-day: **STOP. Count recurrences**: `___`. If > 2, escalate to Sovereign with pattern summary before proceeding. Structural intervention required — another ascertescence cycle will not resolve a systemic failure.

## STEP 3: PATTERN — Analytical Frameworks

|---|---|---|
| **Internal** | **Strengths**: `___` | **Weaknesses**: `___` |
| **External** | **Opportunities**: `___` | **Threats**: `___` |

### Tension Map

### Convergence Detection

*A convergence node exists when 3+ independent signals (intentions, patterns, security findings, session evidence) point to the same action. These are the highest-leverage items.*

| Node | Signal 1 | Signal 2 | Signal 3 | Signal N | Strength | Priority |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| `___` | `___` | `___` | `___` | `___` | `___ signals` | `HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW` |
| `___` | `___` | `___` | `___` | `___` | `___` | `___` |
| `___` | `___` | `___` | `___` | `___` | `___` | `___` |

**Highest-leverage action this cycle**: `___` (`___ signals`)

## STEP 4: DISTILL — Question DAG

*Each question: answering it changes what we do next (not just what we know). Questions are ordered by propagation power — answering earlier questions makes later ones easier or unnecessary.*

### Tier 0: EXISTENTIAL — Answer these and everything reframes

**`C-___ (SESSION-___)`**: `___`
- Routing: `Oracle (___)` → `Diviner (___)` → `Adjudicator (___)`
- Propagates to: `C-___, C-___, C-___`

**`C-___ (SESSION-___)`**: `___`
- Routing: `Oracle (___)` → `Diviner (___)` → `Adjudicator (___)`
- Propagates to: `C-___, C-___`

### Tier 1: STRUCTURAL — Answer these and execution clarifies

**`C-___ (SESSION-___)`**: `___`
- Routing: `Oracle (___)` → `Diviner (___)` → `Adjudicator (___)`
- Propagates to: `C-___, C-___`

**`C-___ (SESSION-___)`**: `___`
- Routing: `Oracle (___)` → `Diviner (___)` → `Adjudicator (___)`
- Propagates to: `C-___`

**`C-___ (SESSION-___)`**: `___`
- Routing: `Oracle (___)` → `Diviner (___)` → `Adjudicator (___)`
- Propagates to: `C-___, C-___`

### Tier 2: OPERATIONAL — Answer these and daily work improves

**`C-___ (SESSION-___)`**: `___`
- Routing: `Commander solo / Commander + Adjudicator / Direct Sovereign`
- Propagates to: `C-___`

**`C-___ (SESSION-___)`**: `___`
- Routing: `___`
- Propagates to: `C-___`

**`C-___ (SESSION-___)`**: `___`
- Routing: `___`
- Propagates to: `(terminal)`

## STEP 5: ROUTE — Triangulation Priority Table

*Top 3-7 questions to feed the triangulation playbook this cycle. Ordered by impact.*

| Priority | Question ID | Question (short) | Why First | Routing |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | `C-___` | `___` | `___` | `Oracle → Diviner → Adjudicator` |
| 2 | `C-___` | `___` | `___` | `Oracle → Diviner → Adjudicator` |
| 3 | `C-___` | `___` | `___` | `Oracle → Adjudicator` |
| 4 | `C-___` | `___` | `___` | `Commander solo` |
| 5 | `C-___` | `___` | `___` | `___` |

Questions deferred to Commander or Commander+Adjudicator (no full triangulation needed): `C-___, C-___, C-___`

---

## FORWARD-LOOKING GUARD

*After completing this ascertescence, evaluate whether we are in a structural loop rather than a solvable problem.*

### Recurrence Audit

| Convergence Node | Appeared in Prior Cycles? | Cycle Count | Action |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------|--------|
| `___` | `Y / N` | `___` | `___` |
| `___` | `Y / N` | `___` | `___` |
| `___` | `Y / N` | `___` | `___` |

**Rule**: If any convergence node has appeared in 2+ prior cycles without resolution, it is a **structural pattern**, not a question. Flag it here and route to Sovereign as a system design intervention, not a triangulation question.

### Structural Patterns Detected This Cycle

| Pattern | Evidence | Recommended Intervention | Escalate? |
|---------|----------|--------------------------|-----------|
| `___` | `___` | `___` | `Y / N` |
| `___` | `___` | `___` | `Y / N` |

### Loop Breaker Check

Before dispatching questions to triangulation, answer:
- [ ] Is this ascertescence generating questions we already generated last cycle?
- [ ] Are we building *about* the problem rather than *solving* it (the Tooling Trap)?
- [ ] Has a prior triangulation cycle answered one of these questions already? (Check `-INBOX/commander/`)

If any box is checked: **STOP. Review prior cycle outputs first.** The question may already be answered.
