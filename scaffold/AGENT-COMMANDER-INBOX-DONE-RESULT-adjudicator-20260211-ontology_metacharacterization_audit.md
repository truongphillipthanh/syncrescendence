## Objective

STRATEGIC AUDIT: Read and rigorously evaluate ALL files in -INBOX/commander/new_ontology_metacharacterization/ and -INBOX/commander/new_ontology_metacharacterization_2/ (10 files, ~200KB). These are 4 web avatar responses across 2 rounds of Palantir Ontology architectural analysis. Your mandate: (1) Identify logical contradictions or unsupported claims across the 4 models. (2) Find gaps - what architectural dimensions are NOT covered by any model? (3) Evaluate which claims are actionable for Syncrescendence vs aspirational theater. (4) Grade each model's analysis: which provides the most implementable insights? (5) Flag any recommendations that contradict our existing CANON or CLAUDE.md Five Invariants. Write your audit to -INBOX/commander/RESULT-adjudicator-ontology-audit.md

## Context Files

Consult as needed:
- `COCKPIT.md` — Constellation overview
- `CLAUDE.md` — Constitutional rules
- `orchestration/state/ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md` — Active intentions
- `engine/DEF-CONSTELLATION_VARIABLES.md` — Global definitions

## Expected Output

- Write results to `-OUTBOX/adjudicator/RESULTS/RESULT-adjudicator-20260211-ontology_metacharacterization_audit.md`
- Or commit directly if you have write access

## Completion Protocol

1. Write output to the specified location
2. Update **Status** above from PENDING to COMPLETE
3. If cross-machine: `git add -A && git commit -m "task: ontology_metacharacterization_audit complete" && git push`
