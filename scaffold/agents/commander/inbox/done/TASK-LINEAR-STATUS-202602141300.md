## Recommendations

1. **SYN-24 is critical and stale** — Complete Mastery IIC email setup is P0-Critical and hasn't moved in 8 days. This should be the top priority for the next session. Likely requires Sovereign credential action.
2. **SYN-51 and SYN-53 are "In Progress" but unassigned** — Both Jira and Todoist onboarding have been in progress since Feb 11 with no assignee. Assign an owner or assess if they're blocked.
3. **No issues have assignees** — All 20 active issues are unassigned. Consider assigning at least the In Progress and P0/P2 Todo items to specific constellation agents.
4. **Backlog grooming needed** — SYN-17 and SYN-19 (IMPL items) have been stale since Feb 6 with low priority labels. Consider canceling or deferring if no longer relevant.
5. **SaaS onboarding cluster (SYN-51/52/53/54)** — These four issues form a coherent workstream. Consider sequencing them explicitly rather than having two in progress simultaneously.
