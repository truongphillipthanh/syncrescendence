**Generated by**: claudecron/session-review
**Status**: PENDING

## Sessions Today

| Time (PST) | Duration | Key Activity |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| ~00:00-04:55 | ~5h | Ajna sync loop active (12+ sync commits), Grok Build INT-1901 committed, 3 orchestration fixes, wisdom compaction |
| 05:01 (x2) | brief | Automated hook fires (187 files changed — large sync batch landed) |
| 07:01 (x2) | brief | Automated hook fires (no new commits — empty session) |
| 13:01 (x2) | brief | Automated hook fires (no new commits — empty session) |
| 13:52-13:56 | ~4min | Automated hooks (Ajna syncs accumulated since morning) |
| 19:02 (x2) | brief | Automated hook fires (no new commits — empty session) |

**Total interactive sessions**: 0 (Sovereign absent today)
**Total automated sessions**: ~12 hook fires (session_log.sh doubled on each trigger — known issue)

## Substantive Commits (non-sync)

| Hash | Type | Message |
|------|------|---------|
| `d8b1bf0` | feat | INT-1901 + INT-C012 — Grok Build constellation avatarization (backlog, P2) |
| `d8c82d9` | fix | use bash prefix for integrity_gate calls in launchd context |
| `1e895e5` | fix | gitignore runtime breaker and budget state files |
| `5f091d4` | chore | auto-compact wisdom at threshold (10 entries) |
| `a150b4f` | fix | pre-clean Finder .DS_Store from git refs before integrity gate |

**Sync commits (Ajna)**: ~80+ (MBA inbox/outgoing sync running every ~5min all day)

## Intention Alignment

| Intention | Progress Today | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| INT-1202 (maximize velocity) | No interactive work — zero Sovereign sessions | **Stalled** |
| INT-1612 (begin ALL automations) | Ajna sync loop operational 24/7; auto-ingest dispatching to Adjudicator; launchd fixes committed | On track (infrastructure) |
| INT-1804 (antifragile infrastructure) | 3 orchestration fixes hardening launchd/integrity pipeline | On track |
| INT-1901 (Grok Build avatarization) | Intention + capture logged, blocked by public release | Parked (external block) |
| INT-1501 (close 30% autonomy gap) | No progress today | Stalled |
| INT-1603 (JIT HighCommand) | No progress | Stalled |
| INT-1708 (NotebookLM pipeline) | No progress | Stalled |
| INT-1616 (LifeOS convergence) | No progress | Stalled |

## Critical Issue: Adjudicator Failure Cascade

**TASK-20260220-deferred_dc_004__followup.md** was dispatched **12 times** and **FAILED 10 times** today:
- Dispatched at: 08:04, 08:09, 08:22, 08:28 (x3), 08:33, 08:34, 08:38 (x2), 09:33, 11:52, 15:31, 23:34
- Every CLAIM was immediately followed by FAILED
- **Root cause unknown** — no error details captured in ledger

**TASK-20260220-deferred_dc_013__followup.md** also failed:
- Dispatched 13:48, claimed 22:49, immediately failed
- Re-dispatched 22:52

**TASK-20260219-deferred_dc_003__followup.md**: dispatched yesterday, completed successfully at 04:58
**TASK-20260219-deferred_dc_002__followup.md**: completed successfully at 04:58

**Verdict**: Adjudicator is in a failure loop on deferred commitment followup tasks. The auto-ingest system correctly retries but without diagnosing the failure mode, it burns dispatch cycles indefinitely. This violates INT-P025 (Agent Auto-Recovery) — the system retries but doesn't self-heal.

## Execution Staging Log

**Empty.** No semantic execution entries written today. The `DYN-EXECUTION_STAGING.md` file contains only the header. This means either:
1. No Commander sessions ran behavioral logging (likely — no interactive sessions)
2. The `create_execution_log.sh` hook is not producing output (needs verification)

## Tomorrow's Priority

1. **Diagnose Adjudicator failure loop** — `deferred_dc_004` has failed 10+ times. Read the task file, check Adjudicator tmux pane logs, identify whether it's a configuration issue, missing dependency, or task specification problem. This is the highest-signal operational issue.

2. **Session log deduplication** — Every hook fire produces two identical session entries. The `session_log.sh` hook appears to run twice per trigger. Minor but adds noise.

3. **Execution log gap** — Decide whether cron sessions should produce execution log entries, or if the staging log is correctly empty for autonomous-only days.

4. **Sovereign engagement** — Zero interactive sessions today. All P0/P1 intentions (INT-1202, INT-1501, INT-1616) are stalled without Sovereign direction. The constellation infrastructure runs, but produces no value without directed work.

## Token Economics

- **Ajna (Kimi K2.5)**: ~80+ sync commits = persistent operation, low-cost (sync is file-based SCP, not API-heavy)
- **Adjudicator (GPT-5.2-codex)**: 12+ dispatch/claim/fail cycles on deferred tasks — wasted tokens on repeated failures
- **Commander (Opus 4.6)**: This cron review session only (~$0.38 budget consumed)
- **Estimated waste**: Adjudicator failure cascade burned API tokens on tasks that immediately fail — quantify by checking tmux output length per attempt

## Signal-to-Noise Assessment

Today was **infrastructure maintenance day** — the constellation ran autonomously, Ajna synced continuously, auto-ingest dispatched tasks, and 3 operational fixes were committed. But no intention-level progress was made. The system is running but not producing.

The Adjudicator failure cascade is the only actionable finding. Everything else is waiting for Sovereign input.
