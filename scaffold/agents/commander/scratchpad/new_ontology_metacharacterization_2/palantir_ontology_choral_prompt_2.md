What's the closest  software that might be considered 'like' Palantir's Ontology?  Or at the very least tries to function like--

If we're really reaching, what 'could' possibly be maybe somewhat kind of resemble an Ontology at the prosumer level

---

Is this the closest one might get? Is there perhaps a more conducive app? Is it because the app too constrained?

Say you had like a website, as a sandbox, would this be enough of a canvas? Would those suggested apps then become another cog/component is this system?

How might someone at this tier shimmy together an ontology?

---

Do the prosumer apps become shackles then? Is there not enough merit for them to remain part of the stack? After all they're the different organs correct? Does not the Ontology integrate as-built? Or should people instead just fabricate their own typed entities, explicit state transitions, explicit verbs, versioned history, action mediation from scratch
