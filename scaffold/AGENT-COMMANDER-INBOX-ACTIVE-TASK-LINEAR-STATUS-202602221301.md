# Linear SYN Status Report — 2026-02-22 13:01

**Generated by**: claudecron/linear-status-check
**Status**: FAILED — Authentication Required

## Failure Details

Two authentication methods were attempted:

1. **REST API (`curl`)**: `LINEAR_API_KEY` environment variable is not set in this shell environment. The cron/scheduled task context does not inherit it from `.zshrc` or any `.env` file.
2. **Linear MCP Integration**: The `mcp__claude_ai_Linear__list_issues` tool is available but requires interactive user permission approval, which cannot be granted in a background scheduled task.

## Required Actions

To fix for future runs, choose one:

- **Option A (env var)**: Add `export LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_...` to the environment that claudecron inherits. If launched via launchd, set it in the plist `EnvironmentVariables` dict (`.zshrc` is NOT sourced by launchd).
- **Option B (MCP pre-auth)**: Grant the Linear MCP tool permission in an interactive Claude Code session first (`/permissions`), so background tasks inherit the grant.

## Recommendations

1. Verify the Linear API key exists: check 1Password or Linear Settings > API > Personal API Keys.
2. For launchd-based cron, inject the key into the plist or a sourced env file (`~/.claude/env` or equivalent).
3. Re-run this task after fixing authentication.
