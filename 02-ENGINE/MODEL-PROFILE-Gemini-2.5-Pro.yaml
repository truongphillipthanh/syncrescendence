name: Gemini 2.5 Pro (Stable Release)

reasoning_modes:
  default: Dynamic Thinking 
  deep_reasoning: Deep Think 
  how_to_invoke: Increase the `thinking_budget` parameter (128-32,768) to force more extensive reasoning. Prompt complexity also adaptively triggers deeper thought.

routing_semantics:
  auto_routing: true 
  triggers: The model's Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture dynamically routes tasks based on assessed prompt complexity, especially for multi-step or analytical problems.

token_limits:
  input: 1,048,576 
  output: 65,535 
  safe_margin: 5% (recommended for predictable output)

formatting_capabilities:
  json_mode: false. JSON structure must be requested via explicit instruction and examples.
  markdown_fidelity: High, but can be compromised by over-verbosity issues if not strictly controlled.
  tables: Good. Capable of generating well-structured markdown tables.

tool_use:
  functions_or_tools: No (based on provided research).
  retrieval_or_browse: No. The model's knowledge is confined to its training data and the information provided in-context.

safety_and_style:
  refusal_style: Default is often verbose and evasive due to safety alignment. A terse, direct refusal must be explicitly prompted.
  over-verbosity_risk: High. The stable release is frequently cited for adding unnecessary preambles and conclusions, and ignoring requests for conciseness. Mitigation requires aggressive, explicit brevity instructions.
  hallucination_triggers: Low-context requests requiring factual recall or precise coding are high-risk. Mitigation is "context curation"—providing extensive, high-quality grounding documents in the prompt to reduce speculation.

style_adapters:
  rhetoric_preservation: A "Style Shield" is required in the prompt to prevent the internal "thinking" process from leaking into the final output and disrupting the desired rhetorical cadence.
  idiom_sensitivity: Tends towards a neutral, professional tone. Specific idioms or cultural nuances must be explicitly requested and modeled with few-shot examples.

temporal_checks:
  how_to_verify_freshness: Cannot be done natively. All recency verification must be handled by providing up-to-date source material within the prompt's context window.

notes:
  other_idiosyncrasies: There is a significant, widely reported performance gap between the API/AI Studio interface and the consumer-facing Web UI, with the API being superior. The stable model suffers from a perceived "regression" compared to its `03-25-preview` version, exhibiting degraded instruction-following and "stubborn" behavior where it resists valid user corrections.
