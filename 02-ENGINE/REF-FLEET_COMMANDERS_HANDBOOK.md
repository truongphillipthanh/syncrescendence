# FLEET COMMANDER'S HANDBOOK: Syncrescendent Edition
## Non-Coding Claude Code for Distributed Cognition

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Generated**: 2026-01-30
**Stream**: C (AJNA9-RECAL)
**Scope**: How Syncrescendence uses Claude Code for conceptual work, not coding

---

## Part I: Philosophy

### Our Use Case

Syncrescendence uses Claude Code for **conceptual work**, not software development:
- Corpus metabolization (SN compression achieving 79.2% reduction)
- Multi-platform orchestration (Constellation with 8 roles)
- Strategic planning (Plan Mode as Oracle substitute)
- Knowledge architecture (CANON, 82 documents across 6 chains)
- Directive execution (parallel stream processing)

This is not the typical Claude Code developer workflow. We use the filesystem as a knowledge substrate, not a codebase.

### Key Differences from Standard Developer Usage

| Standard Usage | Our Usage |
|---|---|
| Extended thinking for debugging | Extended thinking for strategic synthesis |
| Skills for build pipelines | Skills for knowledge workflows |
| Memory for codebase state | Memory for context continuity across platforms |
| Parallel instances for test suites | Parallel instances for directive streams |
| CLAUDE.md for code patterns | CLAUDE.md as constitutional law |
| Git for version control | Git as ground truth + inter-platform bus |
| Tests verify correctness | `make verify` checks structural integrity |

### The Three Laws (Community) Adapted for Syncrescendence

| Community Law | Our Adaptation |
|---|---|
| State Must Be Externalized | **Repo Sovereignty** -- Repository is truth; web apps are cache |
| Verification Must Be Automated | **Receipts (Closure Gate)** -- No completion without artifacts in repo |
| Intelligence Emerges from Constraints | **Five Invariants** -- Constitutional rules focus execution |

## Part II: Interaction Dynamics

### The Triumvirate Frame

Every session begins with calibration to three coordinates:

- **Destination**: Where are we headed? (unchanged: civilizational sensing infrastructure)
- **Method**: How do we get there? (current: SN + Constellation + parallel streams)
- **Current State**: Where are we now? (session-specific, verified by fingerprint)

This is a Syncrescendence-native pattern (see ROSETTA-STONE: UNIQUE). No community equivalent captures this trifecta.

### Directive Patterns

- **Comprehensive over incremental**: Sovereign is bottleneck; directives must enable single-cycle execution without relay
- **Parallel streams**: Disjoint scopes (A/B/C or named streams) enable simultaneous execution
- **Oracle Context + Stream-Specific**: Shared context artifact provides Triumvirate state; individual streams get targeted directives
- **Fingerprinted handoffs**: Every cross-platform transition carries an 8-char git hash

### Extended Thinking Triggers

| Trigger | Budget | Use Case |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `think` | Standard (~4K tokens) | Routine analysis, file assessment |
| `think hard` | Moderate (~10K tokens) | Complex synthesis, multi-file reasoning |
| `ultrathink` | Maximum (~32K tokens) | Strategic decisions, full-corpus reasoning, architectural synthesis |

**Note from ROSETTA-STONE**: Community consensus as of Jan 2026 indicates thinking is auto-enabled at 31,999 tokens and trigger keywords are cosmetic. The actual budget allocation is model-determined. These triggers remain useful as **intent signals** to the Sovereign and as session markers, even if their mechanical effect is debated.

## Part III: The Constellation Architecture

### Platform Roles (Medley Mode)

Per ROSETTA-STONE reconciliation: our Constellation operates in **Medley mode** (specialized prompts per platform), not Chorus mode (same prompt to all). Each platform contributes from its **characteristic cognition**.

| Platform | Role | Function | Characteristic Cognition |
|----------|------|----------|--------------------------|
| Claude Web | INTERPRETER | Messy to structured | Architectural rigor, synthesis, rapport, memory |
| ChatGPT Web | COMPILER | Specs to artifacts | Implementation pragmatism, Canvas, deterministic output |
| Gemini Web | DIGESTOR | Complex to accessible | 1M context, conceptual synthesis, TTS optimization |
| Gemini CLI | ORACLE | Corpus sensing | 2M context, citations, stateless surveys |
| Claude Code | EXECUTOR-LEAD | Directives to implementation | Filesystem sovereignty, extended thinking (Opus) |
| Claude Code | PARALLEL-EXEC | Microscopic tasks | Fast execution (Sonnet x2) |
| Grok Web | RED TEAM | Adversarial challenge | X firehose access, irreverent truth-telling, edge cases |
| Perplexity | VERIFIER | Citation-backed research | Real-time web, source integration, research grounding |

### Three Accounts

| Account | Auth | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| $A1 | Apple (iCloud) | Sovereign substrate, owns origin |
| $A2 | Google | Parallel execution capacity |
| $A3 | Google | Primary interface, ecosystem access |

### Handoff Protocol

1. Generate fingerprint: `make token PHASE=current NEXT=target`
2. Produce handoff token with delta summary
3. Include entry prompt for receiving platform
4. Verify fingerprint on reception

Format: `HANDOFF-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-pN-to-pM`

Time targets:

| Transition | Target |
|------------|--------|
| Claude -> ChatGPT | 30 sec |
| ChatGPT -> Gemini | 20 sec |
| Gemini -> Claude | 15 sec |
| Any -> CLI | 10 sec |
| CLI -> Repository | 5 sec |

### Anti-Patterns

- Never assume ChatGPT remembers context (stateless by design, PROJECT-ONLY mode)
- Never reference "what we discussed" in handoffs -- encode decisions explicitly
- Never produce partial outputs expecting continuation in same thread
- Never skip explicit specification when handing to COMPILER
- Never hand off without a fingerprint

## Part IV: Memory Architecture

### Platform-Specific Memory

| Platform | Memory Type | Scope | Persistence |
|----------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Claude Web | Project Knowledge + Past Chat | Project | Durable |
| ChatGPT Web | Project-Only Mode | Project | Session (no cross-project leak) |
| Gemini Web | Gem + Drive Link | Gem | Synced via Drive |
| Gemini CLI | Stateless | None | Per-invocation only |
| Claude Code | CLAUDE.md + /memory + skills | Repository | Durable (git-tracked) |
| Grok Web | None structured | N/A | Ephemeral |
| Perplexity | None structured | N/A | Ephemeral |

### State Management

**Ephemeral vs Durable** (formerly "Wells vs Rivers" — see ROSETTA_STONE #3):
- Repository = durable (persistent, version-controlled, ground truth)
- Chat sessions = ephemeral (evaporate when closed)
- Ephemeral state must be persisted to durable storage before session ends

**Content Flow State Machine** (COCKPIT.md):
```
CAPTURED > INTERPRETED > COMPILED > STAGED > COMMITTED
                       > DIGESTED >
                       > SENSED >
                       > VERIFIED >
```

**CAPTURE > DISPATCH > RETURN** (high-level mnemonic):
- CAPTURE: Raw ideation enters system
- DISPATCH: Routed to appropriate platform(s) in Medley mode
- RETURN: Artifacts committed to repository (ground truth)

### External Automation (Status)

| Tool | Status | Role |
|------|--------|------|
| Keyboard Maestro | TBD -- not yet configured | Macro shortcuts for handoff sequences |
| Hazel | TBD -- not yet configured | Automated file routing (INBOX processing) |
| Stream Deck | TBD -- not yet configured | Physical buttons for common commands |
| n8n | TBD -- not yet configured | Workflow automation bridge |
| rclone / Drive Sync | Referenced in COCKPIT.md | Gemini Gem Drive synchronization |

### Automation Goals

1. Handoff time < 30 seconds (token generation + clipboard + platform switch)
2. Fingerprint generation fully automated via `make token`
3. Drive sync for Gemini Gems operational
4. INBOX file routing automated via Hazel rules
5. One-button Blitzkrieg launch via Stream Deck

## Appendix: The Five Invariants

Constitutional laws that cannot be overridden by any directive:

1. **Objective Lock** -- No work begins until objective explicitly confirmed
2. **Translation Layer** -- All outputs intelligible without retransmission
3. **Receipts (Closure Gate)** -- No completion without artifacts in repo
4. **Continuation/Deletability** -- Any conversation deletable without losing state
5. **Repo Sovereignty** -- Repository is truth; web apps are cache
