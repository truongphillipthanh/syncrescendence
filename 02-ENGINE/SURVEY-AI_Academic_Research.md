### Research Discovery and Mapping Tools

These tools help you find papers, explore research fields, and visualize connections between studies.

* **SciSpace** aims to be a one-stop shop for academic research. You can search papers, write reports, find things, query Google Scholar, create presentations, and more.
* **Elicit** is a great way to find research, particularly useful for getting an overview of studies on a specific topic. When you ask a question like "mindfulness and anxiety reduction," it provides a list of studies with customizable columns offering information about each one. It's an "OG" (original) tool for finding academic papers, and you can also use it for systematic reviews and creating research reports.
* **Asta** is a completely free scholarly research assistant from **Semantic Scholar**. It allows you to find papers, summarize literature, and will soon include data analysis.
* **Semantic Scholar** is a free, simple, and easy-to-use platform for finding research papers. You can search millions of papers across all fields of science.
* **Litmaps** is an excellent tool for generating a **research map**. You input a **seed paper** and get a visual map of related literature. The axes can be changed to show things like more recently published or more highly cited papers.
* **Research Rabbit** is ideal for exploring a research field in an "open sandbox". After putting in some papers, you can look for similar work, earlier work, and published work by specific authors. It's like a "choose your own adventure" literature review.
* **Consensus AI** allows you to type in a research question and get a "yes or no" answer based on the literature. It shows how many papers support, possibly support, or reject the claim. This is helpful for getting a snapshot of what a research field says about a particular question.
* **Scinito** is a tool where you can ask quick or deep questions, and even add sources. It produces real answers from real papers, helping you touch base with different questions in your research field.
* **AnswerThis AI** is another one-stop place for research tasks, offering AI writing, paper searching, citation map creation, and diagram tools. The AI writer can generate literature reviews, and you can change the referencing style. It's a powerful tool, although Scypace is currently the speaker's favorite.
* **Anara AI** lets you chat with files and folders, outline literature reviews, create notes, search for and summarize papers, and create flashcards. You can upload a paper to your library and chat with the information to better understand the content.
* **Scite AI** is useful for answering semantic questions and finding research papers. You can ask the assistant a question, get a table, and customize the assistant's settings. It's similar to the literature discovery features in other tools like SciSpace.
* **Inciteful** is a literature mapping tool that has a unique feature: the ability to **link two papers**. By putting in two DOIs, it shows all the connecting papers between them, including the number of paths found through the literature. This is great for finding everything in the middle of two review papers.
* **Connected Papers** is another literature mapping tool where you input a seed paper or URL. A distinctive feature is its ability to find **prior works** (to go back in time) and **derivative works** (to find more recent papers based on your paper of interest).

### Writing and Editing Tools

These AI tools focus on drafting, revising, and perfecting your academic manuscripts.

* **Paperpal** is a powerhouse for academic writing. Once integrated into Word or Google Docs, it can perform plagiarism checks, submission checks, and allows you to chat with PDFs. You can also rewrite, write, outline, research, and cite. It incorporates the most important steps of academic writing into one tool.
* **Thesify** is a favorite tool for getting feedback on academic writing. When you upload a research paper, you receive a detailed **feedback summary** with suggestions to make your writing more robust and "more like a boring academic paper". It also helps digest papers and find opportunities to promote the work.
* **Thesis AI** is a great way to **generate literature reviews**. From a single prompt, it can gather references or you can input them, producing extensive outputs, like 39 pages and 38 references, all synthesized and explained. It's an affordable, time-saving way to get a snapshot of a research field.
* **Jenni AI** is a powerful academic writer that functions as an **auto-writer**. As you write, it suggests and generates the next part of your text. It's very easy and automatically references the paragraphs it generates.
* **Yomu AI** is similar to Jenni AI. It will spill out information for you to accept or reject, helping to generate a first draft in an academic way. However, it doesn't automatically cite as you go, requiring you to do that yourself.
* **Gatsbi AI** is a downloadable tool for Windows or Mac. A particularly impressive feature is its ability to **generate a research paper draft** from a Word document containing your ideas and results. It also helps with scholarly writing, finding patents, and creating smarter innovation.
* **Writefull AI** is a great tool for polishing academic writing. It's described as being "like Grammarly" but "for academics on steroids," offering spellchecking and paraphrasing.
* **Trinka** is another tool for perfecting academic writing. It finds issues in your text and offers features like grammar checking, paraphrasing, consistency checks, and reports to ensure your writing will impress academic colleagues.
* **Sourcely** is useful for finding sources to support or reject a claim. You can input a paragraph or claim and have the tool search for supporting papers.
* **Logically AI** is a great tool for connecting ideas, offering a document writer, reference manager, and research assistant. The research assistant and document writer allow you to ask questions, generate outlines, paraphrase, and refine your writing with AI right next to your text.
* **Paper Guide** offers AI search, literature review, AI writer, reference manager, deep research, and more. It aims to streamline literature reviews and help with document writing.

### Comprehension and Data Tools

These tools help you understand complex papers or analyze your own data.

* **Explain Paper** is a really cool tool where you upload a paper, highlight a section, and ask the AI to explain it. You can choose to have it explained "like a middle schooler or a 5-year-old," making complex concepts accessible.
* **Scholarcy** is great for quickly understanding a paper you're unsure about. Once you upload a paper, it provides all the important points, a snapshot of key areas, and analysis without being overwhelming.
* **Petal AI** allows you to upload and import documents, turn them into an AI table, and do multi-document chat. You can ask AI questions about the content of the files you upload.
* **Julius AI** is an excellent tool for **interrogating data**. You upload your data and can ask it questions, and it will generate information, correct itself, and create graphs that help you understand what your data is telling you. It acts as a "data analysis in your pocket".

### Specialized Tools

* **Seamless for Science** is a tool that offers literature reviews and essay helpers, but uniquely focuses on **scholarships and grants**. You can put in the sorts of grants you are looking for, agencies, and application types.
