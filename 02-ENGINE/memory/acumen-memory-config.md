## Part IV: Cross-Platform Synchronization

### Synchronization Primitive
The **corpus** (file system) is ground truth. Platform memory is operational cache.

### Sync Protocol
1. **Corpus → Platform**: Upload relevant CANON documents to each platform's project/gem
2. **Platform → Corpus**: Capture valuable auto-inferences as explicit corpus updates
3. **Cross-Platform**: Human operator transfers context via thread culmination documents

### Conflict Resolution
- Corpus wins in all conflicts
- Platform-specific inferences validated against corpus before acceptance
- Contradictions flagged for human resolution

### Version Control
- Git versioning on all corpus documents
- Platform configurations documented in this file
- Changes logged in session execution logs

---

## Part V: Anti-Patterns

### Memory Configuration Anti-Patterns
1. **Trusting platform memory as ground truth** - Corpus is authoritative
2. **Skipping monthly audits** - Memory drift compounds
3. **Duplicating content across platforms** - Sync complexity explosion
4. **Ignoring stratum hierarchy** - Earlier strata constrain later ones
5. **Over-relying on accumulated memory** - Auto-inferences require curation

### Acumen-Specific Anti-Patterns
1. **Synthesis in Acumen** - Recognition only; synthesis is Coherence's domain
2. **Low-volume operation** - Acumen is high-volume, rapid turnover
3. **Retaining all content** - Aggressive forgetting is essential
4. **Manual qualification** - AI-mediation first, human oversight second
