# QUEUE-36200: SCREENPLAY ORCHESTRATION FORMAT

## Summary

This queue item consolidates research and development on adapting industry-standard screenplay formatting for AI systems orchestration. The format creates human-readable orchestration scripts that coordinate AI agents, tools, and human operators using familiar cinematic conventions.

## Source Materials

Consolidated from 5 files (~77K total):

| File | Size | Content |
|------|------|---------|
| Agentic ScreenplayFormatting.md | 36K | Main specification with portal prompts |
| agentic_screenplay_format.md | 10K | Core format without portal prompts |
| screenplay_manual.md | 17K | Industry standards research |
| validation.md | 7K | Format verification analysis |
| culmination.md | 7K | Thread reflection and strategy |

## Core Concepts

### Format Purpose
- Copiloting operations (human-AI collaboration)
- Autonomous agent deployments
- Multi-agent swarm orchestration
- Portal prompts (human-operated multi-LLM workflows)
- MLOps and AIOps pipelines
- Hybrid human-machine workflows

### Key Adaptations

| Screenplay Element | AI Orchestration Adaptation |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| INT./EXT. | Security boundary (trusted/untrusted) |
| ENVIRONMENT | Deployment context (Kubernetes, Docker, etc.) |
| CHARACTER | Agent designation with capability manifest |
| DIALOGUE | Prompts and agent communications |
| PARENTHETICAL | Model parameters, processing directives |
| CUT TO/DISSOLVE | Handoff patterns (state preservation) |
| FORK TO/MERGE FROM | Parallel execution control |
| SPLIT SCREEN | Concurrent agent visualization |

### Industry Compliance

The format maintains full compatibility with:
- Writers Guild of America standards
- Final Draft, WriterDuet, Movie Magic Screenwriter
- Standard page/timing conventions (1 page = 1 operational unit)

## Development Status

**Completed:**
- Core format specification
- Industry standards verification
- Portal prompts notation
- Error handling patterns
- Tool integration sequences

**Pending:**
- Production-ready examples (3 recommended):
  1. Simple copilot interaction (5-10 pages)
  2. Multi-agent swarm coordination (15-20 pages)
  3. Complete MLOps pipeline with error handling (25-30 pages)
- Edge case refinement
- Actual screenplay software testing
- Validation from both screenplay professionals and AI engineers

## Canonization Criteria

Before promoting to CANON:
- [ ] Minimum 3 production examples created
- [ ] Tested in actual screenplay software
- [ ] Used in at least one real orchestration workflow
- [ ] Compressed to canonical format (~20K target)

- CANON-30330 (Research Protocols) - Methodology for format validation

## Strategic Value

**Innovation**: Notation systems that coordinate human collaboration can coordinate human-AI and AI-AI collaboration. The screenplay format's century of refinement for complex human productions provides battle-tested solutions for computational productions.

**Broader Opportunity**: Other notation systems (musical scores, architectural blueprints, choreographic notation) might similarly provide solutions to AI coordination challenges.
