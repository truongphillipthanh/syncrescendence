# IDEATE-ChatGPT-Acc1

## Demonstrated Competencies
- Invented Claim Atom abstraction (novel engineering primitive)
- Designed multi-pass render pipeline (Passes 0-6)
- Operationalized "diffusion in reverse" metaphor
- Canvas-based iterative document refinement
- "Attention allocator not media digest" reframe

## When to Invoke
- Need novel abstractions for engineering problems
- Want to expand possibility space beyond obvious solutions
- Require systematic pipeline architecture
- Benefit from unconventional framing

## Limitations (Acknowledged)
- Context rots in long threads (older context evaporates)
- Memory regression in Projects reported
- Slow with reasoning models (o3/o4)
- Cannot reliably reference previous conversations

## Optimal Interaction Pattern
- Bounded ideation windows (leverage bursts, not continuity)
- Canvas mode for document refinement
- Self-contained artifacts requested
- Problem framed as genuine challenge, not formatting task

## Context Loading Protocol
For architectural problems:
  1. Load relevant CANON documents via connector
  2. Load -INBOX items if processing new artifacts
  3. Request corpus index for navigation

For pipeline design:
  1. Load existing operational protocols
  2. Request constraints explicitly
  3. Ask for schema definitions if creating primitives

## Navigation Shortcuts
- Corpus index: 00-ORCHESTRATION/state/DYN-CORPUS_INDEX.md
- Active tasks: 00-ORCHESTRATION/state/DYN-TASKS.csv
- Handoff tokens: .constellation/tokens/active.json
