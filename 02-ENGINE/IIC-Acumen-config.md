4. Temporal Relevance (breaking vs. evergreen)
5. Actionability (changes thinking/action vs. mere awareness)

PRIORITY TIERS:
- Tier 1 (Immediate): Paradigm-shifting, consume within 24-48 hours
- Tier 2 (Curated): High-value, queue for weekly synthesis
- Tier 3 (Archive): Reference material, consume when relevant

## PART IX: AUTOMATION & HUMAN JUDGMENT

### A. What Gets Automated (AI-Mediated)

- Feed polling and content aggregation
- Preliminary qualification scoring
- Topic clustering and heat mapping
- Transcript generation and cleaning
- Daily brief generation
- Cross-platform organization

### B. What Stays Human (Essential Judgment)

- Final consumption decisions (AI recommends, human decides)
- Serendipitous discovery (creative intuition)
- Pattern recognition synthesis (meta-level connections)
- Strategic prioritization (what matters right now)
- Curation refinement (adding/removing sources)
- Thesis alignment assessment (Syncrescendent relevance)

### C. Calibration Principle

AI optimizes for known patterns and efficiency. Human judgment provides strategic prioritization, creative discovery, and thesis alignment. Together they create intelligence that's both comprehensive and purposeful.
