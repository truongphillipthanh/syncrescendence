## Detailed Mappings

### 1. Triumvirate (Destination / Method / Current State)

**Status**: UNIQUE

**Internal Definition**: Three-part situational awareness framework used at session start. (a) WHERE ARE WE HEADED = **Intent Compass** (ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md — strategic destination), (b) HOW DO WE GET THERE = **18+ Lenses** (REF-DECISION_ATOMS.md — decision framework), (c) WHERE ARE WE NOW = **Backlog** (DYN-BACKLOG.md — ground truth assessment of current state).

**Community Mapping**: Loosely maps to Commander's Intent (task/purpose/endstate) and the Orient phase of the OODA Loop. The community's execution loop (OBSERVE > ORIENT > DECIDE > ACT > VERIFY > PERSIST) captures temporal awareness as a cycle; the Triumvirate is a synchronization snapshot.

**Reconciliation**: Preserve. No community term bundles strategic destination into the assessment frame. The Triumvirate is a Syncrescendence-native calibration primitive. Each arm now has a concrete artifact: Intent Compass, 18+ Lenses, and DYN-BACKLOG.

**Migration Path**: None. Add gloss for external readers: "Triumvirate ~ Commander's Intent + OODA Orient phase."

---

### 2. Fingerprint / Handoff Token

**Status**: ADAPTED

**Internal Definition**: **Fingerprint** = 8-character git commit hash as cryptographic proof of repository state. **Handoff Token** = complete transfer package: Token ID + Fingerprint + Phase State + Delta Brief. Format: `HANDOFF-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-pN-to-pM`. Protocol archived (design-only, never implemented).

**Community Mapping**: Community uses HANDOFF.md documents and git commit hashes as checkpoints but without the formalized token+fingerprint verification system. The community's Ralph Pattern uses external state files; the "Git as Neural Bus" concept uses commits as inter-agent communication.

**Reconciliation**: Preserve both terms. Our Fingerprint adds cryptographic ground-truth verification the community lacks. Consider simplifying for CLI-only transitions (where git hash suffices) while preserving full Token protocol for cross-platform transitions.

**Migration Path**: Use FINGERPRINT.md for web handoff. Web apps now support GitHub connectors — they can directly load their FINGERPRINT. Critical: each platform must FINGERPRINT back (write state before releasing). This elevates the dispatch staging concept in `-INBOX/`. CLI-only transitions use HANDOFF.md (simpler).

---

### 3. Wells vs Rivers → Ephemeral vs Durable

**Status**: DEPRECATED (replaced by clearer terminology)

**Internal Definition**: "Rivers flow into wells before evaporation." Conversations are rivers (ephemeral). Repository is a well (persistent). Treat platforms as cache; repository as truth.

**Community Mapping**: "Durable Cognition Over Ephemeral Cognition" (Coalescence). "The Filesystem is Your Memory" (Operations Manual). "State Must Be Externalized" (First Law, Fleet Commander's Handbook). Context window = "working memory"; filesystem = "long-term memory."

**Reconciliation**: Per Sovereign directive: use **ephemeral vs durable** instead. The Wells/Rivers metaphor is retired. Community language is clearer and more precise.

**Migration Path**: Replace all "Wells vs Rivers" references with "ephemeral vs durable" in active documentation. Historical references may retain the metaphor as context.

---

### 4. Five Invariants (Constitutional Law)

**Status**: ADAPTED

**Internal Definition**: Constitutional rules from CLAUDE.md: 9 rules across three categories (Structural: FLAT PRINCIPLE, NUMBERED DIRECTORIES, PROTECTED ZONES, SANCTIONED EXCEPTIONS; Semantic: DISTILLATION SEMANTICS, CATEGORY ERROR, LEDGER GROUND TRUTH; Operational: ATOMIC UPDATES, VERIFICATION BEFORE COMPLETION, COMMIT DISCIPLINE). The specific "Five Invariants" as named may refer to a subset from DEFRAG_CONVICTION.

**Community Mapping**: Community uses "CLAUDE.md as Constitution" and "Prime Directives" (8 directives in priority order). The "instruction saturation" concept (~150-200 rules before degradation) is relevant. Self-healing constitution pattern enables automated anti-pattern learning.

**Reconciliation**: Formalize which rules are truly invariant (cannot be overridden by any directive) vs. constitutional (highest priority but flexible). Adopt "Prime Directive" language for the ordered priority list.

**Migration Path**: Clarify the exact Five Invariants. Current CLAUDE.md has 9 rules -- identify the immutable core.

---

### 5. Ring 7 First / Seven Rings (Sovereignty Strata)

**Status**: UNIQUE

**Internal Definition**: Concentric sovereignty layers renamed to sigma notation: sigma-0 (Sovereign), sigma-1 (Teleology), sigma-2 (Architecture), sigma-3 (Context Engineering), sigma-4 (Ground Truth), sigma-5 (Intelligence Substrate), sigma-6 (Access Layer), sigma-7 (Execution Substrate). "Ring 7 First" = execution substrate must work before upstream layers matter (outside-in engineering).

**Community Mapping**: No equivalent. Community has configuration precedence hierarchies (managed > CLI > local > project > user) and behavioral loops, but no model of layered sovereignty from human through execution substrate.

**Reconciliation**: Preserve entirely. Complete the rename from "Ring" to sigma. Disambiguate: sigma = operational sovereignty, tau = celestial/developmental (CANON cosmology).

**Migration Path**: Ratify sigma/tau terminology split. Update all remaining "Ring" references to sigma.

---

### 6. Oracle-Executor → Plan/Implementation (Oracle = Grok)

**Status**: DEPRECATED (terminology reassigned)

**Internal Definition**: Historical: Oracle = web app session, Executor = CLI instance. This protocol was contrived internally and created confusion with the community term.

**Sovereign Directive**: From now on, **Oracle means Grok** (RECON role — X firehose, cultural sensing, adversarial challenge). The old Oracle-Executor pattern is replaced by **Plan/Implementation** — the consensus terminology. The platform roles (INTERPRETER, EXECUTOR-LEAD, PARALLEL-EXEC) remain valid under the Constellation architecture but are no longer framed as Oracle-Executor.

**Community Mapping**: Plan Mode vs Implementation Mode captures the planning-then-executing split. Task Dispatcher pattern has Commander Agent + Worker Agents.

**Reconciliation**: Adopt community consensus. Our specific innovation — the handoff document as bridge across platform boundaries — remains our unique contribution, now framed under Plan/Implementation rather than Oracle-Executor.

**Migration Path**: Replace "Oracle-Executor" with "Plan/Implementation" in all active docs. "Oracle" now exclusively refers to Grok (RECON). Historical "Oracle sessions" (Oracle 0-13) retain numbering as lineage markers in Pedigree logs.

---

### 7. CAPTURE > DISPATCH > RETURN

**Status**: ADAPTED

**Internal Definition**: High-level content lifecycle shorthand. The full state machine in COCKPIT.md: CAPTURED > INTERPRETED > COMPILED > STAGED > COMMITTED (with parallel paths through DIGESTED, SENSED, VERIFIED). The Blitzkrieg Protocol uses Preparation > Finalization > Execution > Archival.

**Community Mapping**: Community's agentic loop: OBSERVE > ORIENT > DECIDE > ACT > VERIFY > PERSIST. Task Lifecycle: TODO > IN_PROGRESS > BLOCKED? > VERIFICATION > DONE. Session Pattern: Set context > State task > Plan > Review > Execute > Commit > Update > Reset.

**Reconciliation**: Preserve the three-word mnemonic as a high-level abstraction. Map: CAPTURE ~ "Task Definition / Source Aggregation," DISPATCH ~ "Execution / Parallel Processing," RETURN ~ "Verification / Commit / Archive."

**Migration Path**: Formalize as high-level abstraction of the full COCKPIT state machine.

---

### 8. Chorus / Constellation

**Status**: ALIGNED (with terminology correction needed)

**Internal Definition**: **Constellation** = complete multi-platform system (3 accounts, 8 roles). **Chorus** = the operational mode where platforms contribute from characteristic cognition.

**Community Mapping**: Community defines these precisely in the Distributed Cognition Research Synthesis: **Chorus** = same prompt to all platforms, integrate afterward. **Medley** = specialized prompts per platform, coordinated execution. Our operational mode is actually Medley (specialized roles), not Chorus.

**Reconciliation**: Adopt community's precise Chorus/Medley distinction. Our eight-role system operates in Medley mode (specialized), not Chorus mode (parallel-identical). Constellation remains our term for the full multi-platform architecture.

**Migration Path**: Update COCKPIT.md to clarify: "Constellation operating in Medley mode." Reserve "Chorus" for same-prompt parallel execution experiments.

---

### 9. 18+ Lenses (Decision Framework)

**Status**: UNIQUE

**Internal Definition**: Comprehensive decision evaluation framework. Original Nine (Oracle4): Syncrescendent Route, Bitter Lesson Scaling, Antifragile, Meet the Moment, Steelman & Redteam, Personal Idiosyncrasies, Potency Without Resolution Loss, Elegance + Dev Happiness, Agentify + Human-Navigable. Extended Nine (Oracle6): First Principles, Systems Thinking, Industrial Engineering, Complexity Theory, Permaculture, Design Thinking, Agile, Lean, Six Sigma. Threshold: 12/18 pass for approval.

**Additional Perspectives** (Sovereign clarification):
- **4 'O' Qualities**: Omnibenevolence, Omnipresence, Omnipotence, Omniscience — used for scaffolding development during Claude Code disruption
- **REF-DECISION_ATOMS.md**: Ties into Intent Compass and Ajna Pedigree, carried over to Backlog
- **"Superintelligently"**: Meta-lens for maximum capability invocation
- **"Think about the nth order effects"**: Cascading consequence analysis
- Additional perspectives tracked in [REF-LENS-GOVERNANCE]

**Community Mapping**: No equivalent. Community uses ad-hoc decision heuristics, verification matrices, and antipattern catalogs, but no unified multi-lens decision framework.

**Reconciliation**: Preserve and expand. The "18+" acknowledges the framework is open-ended. The original 18 developed the canon; the 4 O qualities developed the scaffolding. This is poised for interdisciplinary synthesis.

**Migration Path**: Consolidate all lens references into REF-DECISION_ATOMS.md. Formalize the 4 O qualities as a scaffolding-specific lens set.

---

### 10. sigma-7 / Sovereignty Strata

**Status**: UNIQUE (adhoc — needs holistic redesign)

See Ring 7 First / Seven Rings (entry #5). The directory `05-SIGMA/` houses operational knowledge corresponding to sigma-7 scope (execution substrate tooling).

**Sovereign Clarification**: This is an adhoc solution within the corpus. The sigma-7 stratum is interdependent with each and every other stratum. The current implementation isolates it; there should be a more contrived holism where each stratum's interdependencies are explicitly mapped. Future work should address this architectural gap.

---

### 11. PALACE → Synapticality

**Status**: ADAPTED (definition discovered, successor term introduced)

**Internal Definition**: PALACE refers to the **Cognitive Palace**, a build on the Memory Palace concept. The Cognitive Palace eventually became its own thing — referenced in CANON as `CANON-20000-PALACE-lattice.md`.

**Sovereign Directive**: The successor term is **Synapticality**. With the imminence of new personal devices and the Cambrian explosion of robot forms, along with the disruption of conventional operating systems (Language User Interface still not well-integrated), there will need to be a reimagination of UX. This is closely related to the Hardware Teleology (part of the backlog).

**Related Terms** (mostly from Andrej Karpathy):
- **Cognitive Core**: What General Intelligence "ought" to be
- **Iron Man Suit**: Agentic-Autonomy slider (how much the AI does vs. user)
- **StarCraft/Factorio metaphors**: Resource management / base-building analogies for AI orchestration
- VR ≈ conventional Workstation; Mobile + Wearables ≈ AR
- All relevant to new interaction paradigms, especially with OpenClaw disruption

**Community Mapping**: Memory Palace (loose). Community's Memory Crystal for cognitive architecture. Karpathy's framing bridges AI capability with UX design.

**Reconciliation**: PALACE is the historical term; Synapticality is the active successor. Preserve CANON-20000 as historical record. Use Synapticality for all new work on UX reimagination.

**Migration Path**: Create ARCH-SYNAPTICALITY_SPEC.md capturing the full vision. Link to Hardware Teleology backlog items.

---

### 12. SN Format → Syncrescript

**Status**: UNIQUE (renamed)

**Internal Definition**: Hybrid notation system for ~80% token compression, now called **Syncrescript** (because it's so idiosyncratic). Three-tier structure: **sutra** (one-line essence, <=100 chars), **gloss** (2-4 sentences WHY), **spec** (YAML-like structured detail). Block types: TERM, NORM, PROC, PASS, ARTIFACT, TEST. Symbols: Psi (Syncrescendence), Kappa (CANON), etc. Demonstrated 79.2% compression on CANON.

**Community Mapping**: Community has Progressive Disclosure for Skills (name+description at startup; full instructions on activation) -- architecturally similar to sutra > gloss > spec. Memory Crystal Protocol for runtime compression. Semantic Compression (ACL 2024) describes 6-8x extension via graph-based topic modeling. Community compresses at runtime; we compress at authoring time.

**Reconciliation**: Preserve entirely under new name. The sutra/gloss/spec three-tier encoding is a novel contribution. "Syncrescript" acknowledges the idiosyncratic nature of the notation while claiming it as a Syncrescendence-native artifact.

**Migration Path**: Rename references from "SN Format" / "Semantic Notation" to "Syncrescript" in active documentation. Tooling (`sn_encode.py`, `sn_decode.py`, `sn_expand.py`) retains `sn_` prefix for backward compatibility.

---

### 13. IMEP

**Status**: DEPRECATED

**Internal Definition**: Deprecated communication packet format (EVidence/PLaN/EXEcution/AUDit). Not found in current operational documents.

**Community Mapping**: Functionality absorbed by Handoff Tokens and Blitzkrieg execution logs. Community equivalents: structured hook responses, Task JSON schemas.

**Reconciliation**: Remove from active documentation. Historical note only.

**Migration Path**: Already migrated. Grep for orphan IMEP references and clean.

---

### 14. Blitzkrieg → Neo-Blitzkrieg (Full Constellation Pipeline)

**Status**: ADAPTED (supersedes all prior variants)

**Internal Definition**: The Neo-Blitzkrieg is an "all hands on deck" full-constellation pipeline. It supersedes all prior Blitzkrieg variants (Lane A/B/C, Dropbox pattern, etc.).

**Neo-Blitzkrieg Pipeline** (Sovereign specification):
```
Sovereign: brainDump
  → Ajna: updates Intent Compass + Backlog + Ajna Pedigree & dispatches {HANDOFF} TO
    → /-INBOX(Psyche): calibrates-orients-situates Triumvirate & dispatches {HANDOFF} TO
      → /-INBOX(Cartographer): maps hidden connections/insights & dispatches {HANDOFF} TO
        → /-INBOX(Commander): formulates discourse (Chorus/Medley) & dispatches {FINGERPRINTS} TO
          → /-INBOX(Oracle, Augur): immediate senses / deep researches & dispatches {FINGERPRINTS} TO
            → NotebookLM: integrates-unifies + annotates hidden synergy/emergence & dispatches {FINGERPRINT} TO
              → Visier: hermeneutically schematic designs + provokes Vanguard creativity & dispatches {FINGERPRINT} TO
                → Vanguard: creatively design-develops & dispatches {FINGERPRINT} TO
                  → Diviner: exegetically elaborates hidden connections/insight & dispatches {FINGERPRINT} TO
                    → /-INBOX(Commander): plans + implements (Parallel/Subagent) directive & dispatches {DIRECTIVE} TO
                      → /-INBOX(Executor): executes directives & dispatches {EXECUTION_LOG} TO
                        → adjudicates-debugs & dispatches {REVIEWTROSPECTIVE} TO
                        → /-INBOX(Cartographer): unveils hidden connections/insights & dispatches {HANDOFF} TO
                        → /-INBOX(Psyche): recalibrates-reorients-resituates Triumvirate + updates Backlog & dispatches {HANDOFF} TO
                        → /-INBOX(Ajna): relays meta-macroscopic executive summary & dispatches {HANDOFF} TO
                        → /-SOVEREIGN: relays meta-macroscopic executive summary
                        → (passes through audizer.xml multi-pass for Sovereign audio review)
```

**Backlog**: Consider Manus integration; upgrades to Perplexity/Grok research capabilities. NotebookLM found as place for Research artifacts (Gemini accesses via connector; avatarize NotebookLM pending).

**Community Mapping**: Community uses git worktrees for parallel execution, claude-squad/Crystal for multi-agent management, Task Dispatcher pattern. The Neo-Blitzkrieg goes further: it's a full-constellation orchestration pipeline, not just parallel CLI lanes.

**Reconciliation**: The Neo-Blitzkrieg is the authoritative execution pattern. All prior Blitzkrieg variants (Lane A/B/C, Dropbox, CLAUDE.md references) are superseded.

**Migration Path**: Implement via dispatch surfaces (`-INBOX/` per-agent folders, `-OUTGOING/`, `FINGERPRINT.md` protocol). Update REF-BLITZKRIEG_PROTOCOL_VNEXT.md to reflect this pipeline.

---

### 15. IIC Configs

**Status**: ACTIVE (Still a Go)

**Internal Definition**: Identity-Intelligence Complex. Five IICs (Acumen, Coherence, Efficacy, Mastery, Transcendence) mapped to chains with associated virtues. Extremely detailed: communication SLAs, response templates, synthesis cycles (daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly), platform alignment matrices, governance.

**Sovereign Directive**: IIC Configs are still a Go. Once the granular teleological specifics are fully elucidated, configuration will be much easier — especially as more platforms have onboarding agents and social media platforms can increasingly curate feeds algorithmically. Intelligent switching and routing (as demonstrated in the Constellation) will extend to IIC configuration. The 5 email accounts are already created.

**Community Mapping**: Community's Medley Model with platform specialization. Swarm orchestration with 60+ specialized agents. Adjacent but not identity-based.

**Reconciliation**: Not over-engineered — ahead of the curve. The five-chain ontology maps to increasingly capable platform personalization. The inter-IIC messaging protocol will become practical as platform APIs mature. Preserve full specification.

**Migration Path**: Complete IIC configuration as platforms develop onboarding/curation capabilities. PROJ-002 tracks this work (Acumen/Coherence done, 3 remaining).

---

### 16. Chain Matrix / Tri-Helix

**Status**: DEPRECATED (per Sovereign directive)

**Internal Definition**: Chain Matrix maps chains (Intelligence, Information, Insight, Expertise, Knowledge, Wisdom) to virtues (Acumen, Coherence, Efficacy, Mastery, Transcendence) to IICs. Referenced in CANON as `CANON-21000-CHAIN_MATRIX-lattice.md`. Tri-Helix referenced as `CANON-21100-TRI_HELIX-lattice.md` but not defined in read corpus.

**Community Mapping**: No community equivalent. Community has agent specialization by task role, not knowledge-chain ontology.

**Reconciliation**: Deprecated per Sovereign directive. The Chain Matrix and Tri-Helix CANON files remain as historical records (Protected Zone), but the concepts are no longer active in operational planning. The six-chain ontology persists through the IIC framework (entry #15) which remains active.

**Migration Path**: Mark as historical in CANON. Do not reference in new operational documents. Chain/Virtue concepts that remain active are captured under IIC Configs (#15).

---

### 17. Ralph Pattern

**Status**: ALIGNED

**Internal Definition**: Fresh context loops with externalized state. "Don't rely on conversation history. Repository is truth; web apps are cache. Handoff documents encode decisions, not conversations." Core: `while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude-code ; done`.

**Community Mapping**: Identical. Created by Geoffrey Huntley, now official Anthropic plugin. Community name: Ralph Wiggum Pattern. Our usage adds the ephemeral vs durable philosophical grounding for why Ralph works.

**Reconciliation**: Already aligned. Use community term as-is.

**Migration Path**: None needed. **Sovereign question**: Do we have this formally implemented somewhere? Verify and document the implementation location if it exists.

---

### 18. Blitzkrieg Lane A/B/C

**Status**: DEPRECATED (superseded by Neo-Blitzkrieg)

**Internal Definition**: Three parallel execution lanes: Lane A (Strategic/architectural, Opus), Lane B (Tactical execution, Sonnet or Codex), Lane C (Validation/secondary, Haiku or Gemini). Includes toolchain options and model selection criteria.

**Community Mapping**: Community's 3-tier model routing: "WASM for simple, Haiku for medium, Opus for complex -- achieving 75% API cost reduction." Community routes by complexity; we route by strategic function.

**Reconciliation**: All prior Blitzkrieg variants are superseded by the Neo-Blitzkrieg full constellation pipeline (entry #14). The Lane A/B/C model was a transitional construct; the Neo-Blitzkrieg replaces it with role-based dispatch through the full Pantheon.

**Migration Path**: Remove Lane A/B/C references from active documents. Model routing concepts (Opus for complex, Sonnet for execution, Haiku for validation) persist as implementation detail within the Neo-Blitzkrieg Commander stage.

---

## Community Patterns: Gap Analysis

Significant community patterns without internal equivalents.

| # | Community Pattern | Priority | Description | Recommended Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Self-Healing Constitution | HIGH | Meta-Hook monitors failures, auto-appends to CLAUDE.md Anti-Patterns | Implement PostToolUse hook |
| G2 | Memory Crystal Protocol | MEDIUM | Librarian sub-agent at 60% context compresses session to MEMORY.md | Consider SN as encoding format |
| G3 | Adversarial Validation | MEDIUM | Explicitly disprove claims; hardened if unfalsifiable | Activate Grok RED TEAM role |
| G4 | Temporal Versioning / Decay | HIGH | Decay signals, replacement notes, refresh triggers for technical claims | Add temporal metadata; fix stale CLAUDE.md |
| G5 | Git Worktree Isolation | HIGH | Isolated worktrees for parallel agents sharing .git | Adopt as canonical Blitzkrieg mechanism |
| G6 | Hooks-Based Automation | MEDIUM | PreToolUse/PostToolUse/Stop/PreCompact hooks for deterministic automation | Define hooks for common failure modes |
| G7 | Context Degradation Monitoring | MEDIUM | Performance curve: peaks 0-50%, degrades 70%, critical 85%+ | Implement PreCompact warnings |
| G8 | Subagent Architecture | HIGH | context: fork + agent field in SKILL.md for token-efficient delegation | Add to skills; enables isolated execution |

---

## Immediate Actions

### Critical Fixes
1. **CLAUDE.md Extended Thinking** (lines 59-66): Lists specific token allocations (4K/8K/32K) marked OUTDATED by community since Jan 2026. Update to reflect current state (thinking auto-enabled at 31,999 tokens; keywords are cosmetic).
2. **Chorus/Medley correction**: Our Constellation operates in Medley mode (specialized roles), not Chorus mode. Update COCKPIT.md.
3. **sigma/tau ratification**: Complete rename from "Ring" to sigma per Accretion Resolution Pass.

### Architecture Adoptions
4. Implement git worktree isolation for Blitzkrieg parallel lanes.
5. Add `context: fork` to skills for subagent delegation.
6. Create Self-Healing Constitution hook.

### Definition Discovery
7. ~~Locate PALACE definition in CANON-20000~~ — RESOLVED: Cognitive Palace → Synapticality (see #11)
8. ~~Locate Tri-Helix definition in CANON-21100~~ — DEPRECATED: Chain Matrix/Tri-Helix deprecated per Sovereign (#16)
9. Clarify which rules constitute the "Five Invariants" vs. the broader constitutional set.

### 169. Clarescence / Claresce (Value-Guided Progressive Refinement)

**Status**: UNIQUE

**Internal Definition**: The meta-operation of running any decision, question, or path through the *entire* Syncrescendence evaluation stack to converge on the authentic path forward. Each evaluative layer is a "render pass" that adds fidelity; the composite of all passes produces a high-resolution recommendation.

**Etymology**: From Latin *clarescere* — "to become clear, to grow bright." The -esce suffix encodes iterative process ("in the process of becoming") at the morpheme level. Phonetic sibling to Syncrescendence itself.

**Pronunciation**: Verb: klah-RESS (2 syllables). Noun: klah-RESS-ence (3 syllables).

**Metaphor Stack**:
- **Linear regression**: Finding the line of best fit through scattered values, constraints, and intentions
- **Diffusion model**: Starting from noise (entropy/uncertainty), iteratively denoising toward signal, guided by the Triumvirate as conditioning prompt
- **Render passes**: Progressive resolution increase — each pass adds a layer of fidelity until photorealistic

**The 10 Clarescence Passes**:

| Pass | Layer | Reference | Question |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Triumvirate Calibration | ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md + DYN-BACKLOG.md | Where headed? Where now? Does this serve the destination? |
| 2 | 18+ Lens Evaluation | REF-DECISION_ATOMS.md | Passes Syncrescendent Route, Bitter Lesson, Antifragile, First Principles, Systems Thinking, etc.? (12/18 threshold) |
| 3 | CANON Coherence | 01-CANON/ (79 files) | Aligns with constitutional knowledge? Coheres with existing ontology? |
| 4 | Omni-Quality Aspiration | CANON-24000 | Moves toward Omnibenevolence, Omniscience, Omnipotence, Omnipresence? |
| 5 | Five Faces Alignment | CANON-11000 | Honors Sensing, Meaning-Making, Intention-Formation, Embodiment, Strategic Harmony? |
| 6 | Rosetta Precision | REF-ROSETTA_STONE.md | Right terms? Inventing where should adopt? Adopting where should invent? |
| 7 | Backlog Coherence | DYN-BACKLOG.md + DYN-TASKS.csv | Fits current priorities? Unblocks or creates new blocks? |
| 8 | Cascading Effects (nth-order) | Intention Compass dependency map | 2nd, 3rd, nth-order consequences? What breaks? What compounds? |
| 9 | Energy State Awareness | Sovereignty Constitution v0 | Sustainable at current energy? Respects circadian, cathedral, modal segregation? |
| 10 | Authenticity Gate | SOUL of Syncrescendence | True to who we are? Preserves sovereignty? Would Sovereign at peak clarity approve? |

**Invocation Patterns**:
- Command: `/claresce` — invoke full 10-pass evaluation
- Spoken: "Claresce the path forward on [topic]."
- Partial: "Run passes 1-3 on [topic]." (lightweight clarescence)
- Full: "Full clarescence — all 10 passes."

**Output Format**: A convergent recommendation — not a list of options, but a single authenticated path that has survived every evaluative layer. Structured as:
```
CLARESCENCE: [topic]
Passes: [which passes run]
Fidelity: [partial|full]
Convergent Path: [the recommendation]
Falsifier: [what would make this wrong]
Confidence: [low|medium|high]
```

**Community Mapping**: No equivalent. Community has ad-hoc decision heuristics and verification checklists, but no unified progressive refinement meta-operation with exhaustive criteria and formal invocation.

**Reconciliation**: Preserve entirely. This is the operational verb of the Syncrescendence — the act of *doing* what the system is designed to do.
