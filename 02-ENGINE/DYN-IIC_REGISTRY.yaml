    The two DIRECTIVE-042A configs (Acumen, Coherence) from 2026-01-09 have a
    different section structure than the three DIRECTIVE-046B configs (Efficacy,
    Mastery, Transcendence) from 2026-01-15. The later batch added Eighteen Lenses,
    Memory Integration, and Exempla sections. The template (TEMPLATE-IIC.md)
    normalizes all sections into a unified structure. Backfilling Acumen and
    Coherence with Lenses, Memory, and Exempla sections is recommended.
