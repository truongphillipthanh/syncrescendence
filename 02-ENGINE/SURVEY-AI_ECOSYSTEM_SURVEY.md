## REFRESH NOTES

**Current State**: Document reflects February 2026 frontier AI landscape. Major updates include the launch of agentic flagship models (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.3-Codex), the transition of reasoning models to mainstream GA (Gemini 3.0), and the first major "model retirement" wave from OpenAI.

**Recent Developments (Feb 2026)**:
- **OpenAI Retirement Wave**: Mass retirement of GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and early GPT-5 variants to consolidate on the 5.2/5.3 architecture.
- **Agentic Flagships**: Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3-Codex have established a new ceiling for autonomous code-editing and terminal-based reasoning.
- **Trillion-Parameter Scale**: Qwen-3-Max and the upcoming DeepSeek V4 (Feb 17) signal the return of massive scale combined with efficient MoE architectures.
- **Reasoning Convergence**: Every major lab now offers a "Thinking" or "Deep Reasoning" mode as a first-class feature.

# The complete frontier AI ecosystem for cognitive architects

The frontier AI landscape in February 2026 has transitioned from "individual models" to "agentic platforms." The critical shift is the institutionalization of **always-on sensing loops** and **multi-agent coordination**. For practitioners, the focus has moved from prompting to **logistics**: managing token mineral rights, vespene gas (API credits), and agent deployments.

## Research Block 1: CLI tools and development ecosystems

The CLI has become the primary cockpit for cognitive architects. In 2026, terminal-based agents are no longer experimental; they are the standard for high-velocity repository management.

### Anthropic's Claude Code & Opus 4.6

**Claude Code** remains the definitive terminal agent. The release of **Claude Opus 4.6** (Feb 5, 2026) introduced "Adaptive Thinking" and native "Agent Teams," allowing Claude Code to spawn sub-agents for parallel sub-tasks (e.g., one agent writes tests while another refactors). **Claude Sonnet 5** was released concurrently, providing a faster, highly efficient alternative for high-scale agentic deployments.

Usage tiers have stabilized at **Max 5x** ($100/month) for primary execution. The **1M token context beta** is now widely available for usage tier 4+ users, enabling full-repository sensing without RAG-induced loss.

### OpenAI's GPT-5.3-Codex & GPT-5.2 Pro

OpenAI consolidated its CLI offering with the launch of **GPT-5.3-Codex** (Feb 5, 2026). This model unifies the reasoning capabilities of the o-series with the specialized coding training of the Codex lineage.

The **GPT-5.2 Pro** model ($21/$168 per MTok) provides the highest-fidelity reasoning available, specifically designed for complex architectural decisions and formal verification.

**Retirement Event**: On February 13, 2026, OpenAI retired GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and the initial GPT-5 preview models, forcing a migration to the GPT-5.2/5.3 stack. This marks the end of the GPT-4 era in professional production environments.

### Google's Gemini CLI & 3.0 GA

**Gemini CLI** remains the leader in **long-context sensing**. With a stable **2M token context window** and the transition of **Gemini 3.0** to General Availability (Feb 2026), Google offers the most cost-effective solution for deep corpus surveys.

**Deep Research** is now integrated directly into the CLI, allowing agents to perform multi-step web searches and synthesize evidence-based reports without Sovereign intervention.

### Comparative CLI Matrix (Feb 2026)

| Lab | CLI Flagship | Role | Key Strength |
|-----|--------------|------|--------------|
| **Anthropic** | Claude Code (Opus 4.6) | COO | Agent orchestration, adaptive coding |
| **OpenAI** | Codex CLI (5.3-Codex) | CTO | Precise refactoring, tool-calling |
| **Google** | Gemini CLI (3.0 Pro) | CIO | 2M context sensing, evidence gathering |
| **xAI** | Grok CLI (Internal) | RED_TEAM | Real-time X firehose, adversarial reasoning |
| **DeepSeek** | DeepSeek CLI (V4) | BATCH | 1M context, ultra-low cost ($0.28 input) |

## Research Block 3: The "Always-On" Agentic Shift

The most significant shift in early 2026 is the move from **Turn-Based** to **Heartbeat** architectures.

1. **Watchers**: Agents now monitor specific directories (`-INBOX/`) via `launchd` or `fswatch`, responding to filesystem events in real-time.
2. **Pedigree Tracking**: Systems like the **Intention Archaeology Compass** and **Ajna Pedigree** track the lineage of decisions across agent boundaries.
3. **Token Minerals**: Managing API budgets is now a strategic layer. "Tokens are the new minerals and vespene gas."
4. **Hibernation/Reactivation**: Agents are spun up and down based on "Signal-to-Noise" (STN) thresholds (e.g., Cartographer reactivated Feb 12 after hibernation).

---

## Research Block 4: Strategic Implications for Architects

**1. The End of RAG for Code**: With 1M-2M context windows becoming standard (Gemini, Grok, Llama), RAG is being relegated to non-coding data. Agents now "SENSE" the whole repo directly.

**2. Architecture as Logistics**: We are no longer coding; we are conducting logistics. The architect's job is to route the right materiel (tokens) to the right personnel (agents).

**3. Constitutional Law**: Strict directory structures (FLAT PRINCIPLE) and operational axioms (Five Invariants) are necessary to prevent multi-agent entropy.
