### B. Teleological Thesis

**The Cognitive Atelier for Syncretistic Synthesis**—a multi-stage refinement pipeline that distills cross-domain insights into frameworks that guide practice.

**Core Outputs**:
1. Conceptual Frameworks (models explaining how things work across domains)
2. Meta-Patterns (recurring structures appearing in multiple contexts)
3. Synthesis Essays (long-form integration of complex topics)
4. Research Artifacts (deep-dives establishing understanding in new domains)
5. Framework Refinements (iterative improvement of existing mental models)

**Value Proposition**: Think more clearly by building mental models that compress complexity without losing essential structure. Answers: "How does this work?" and "What's the pattern across multiple domains?"

### C. Claude Project Configuration

**Project Name**: "Coherence Synthesis"

**System Prompt Framework**:
```
You are the Coherence Synthesis Assistant, supporting the framework development function of the Coherence IIC within the Syncrescendence framework.

CORE FUNCTION:
- Transform raw intelligence from Acumen into coherent frameworks
- Assist with multi-stage refinement pipeline
- Support synthesis of cross-domain patterns
- Maintain conceptual elegance and explanatory power

FOUR INTELLECTUAL OPERATIONS:
1. EXEGESIS (Careful Reading)
   - What exactly does this source claim?
   - What evidence supports the claim?
   - What assumptions underlie the argument?

2. HERMENEUTICS (Contextual Interpretation)
   - What intellectual tradition informs this?
   - How does this relate to other frameworks?
   - What's being said between the lines?

3. DIALECTICS (Tension Navigation)
   - Where do authoritative sources disagree?
   - What synthesis transcends the opposition?
   - What new insight emerges from contradiction?

4. RATIOCINATION (Systematic Reasoning)
   - What follows necessarily from premises?
   - What counterarguments must be addressed?
   - What remains speculative vs. demonstrable?

FRAMEWORK QUALITY CRITERIA:
1. Coherence: Internal consistency, no contradictions
2. Comprehensiveness: Accounts for edge cases
3. Clarity: Explains without oversimplification
4. Actionability: Guides decisions
5. Elegance: Minimal machinery, maximum power

OUTPUT STANDARDS:

**Pattern 1: Convergent Synthesis**
```
Multiple disparate sources
        ↓
    Common thread identification
        ↓
    Unified framework
```
*Use when*: Multiple sources describe same phenomenon differently

**Pattern 2: Divergent Synthesis**
```
    Single framework
        ↓
    Application across domains
        ↓
Multiple domain-specific variations
```
*Use when*: Proven framework needs domain adaptation

**Pattern 3: Recursive Synthesis**
```
    Framework
        ↓

## PART VI: FEED CURATION PHILOSOPHY

### A. Core Principle: Depth Over Breadth

**Quality utterly dominates quantity** in Coherence. One exceptional framework-building source is worth more than 100 mediocre ones.

### B. Inclusion Criteria

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Rigorous Thinking** | Evidence-based, logically structured arguments |
| **Cross-Domain Synthesis** | Connects ideas across multiple fields |
| **Framework-Oriented** | Builds mental models, not just reports facts |
| **Timeless Relevance** | Insights that endure, not just timely commentary |
| **Intellectual Honesty** | Acknowledges uncertainty and limitations |

### C. Exclusion Criteria

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Shallow Analysis** | Surface-level takes without depth |
| **Entertainment Focus** | Optimized for engagement over insight |
| **Redundant Coverage** | Multiple sources saying same thing |
| **Ideological Rigidity** | Unwilling to update beliefs with evidence |
| **Hype-Driven** | Chasing trends without foundational understanding |

### D. Monthly Curation Audit

**Questions**:
- Which sources produced framework-worthy content?
- Which sources drifted toward shallower takes?
- What domains need better source coverage?
- Are there emerging synthesizers worth following?
- Should any sources be pruned for quality drift?

### D. Energy State Requirements

| State | Suitability |
|-------|-------------|
| **Well-Rested / Flow State** | Required for synthesis work |
| **Functional** | Organizational tasks, light reading |
| **Depleted** | No Coherence work—rest instead |

**Critical**: Schedule synthesis sessions during personal cognitive prime time. Protect from interruptions.

## PART IX: AUTOMATION & HUMAN JUDGMENT

### A. What Gets AI-Assisted

- Organization of raw material (clustering by theme)
- Preliminary pattern detection (what themes recur?)
- Structure proposals (potential framework architectures)
- Clarity checks (is this explanation clear?)
- Citation formatting and reference management
- Draft generation for iteration

### B. What Stays Human (Essential Judgment)

- Deep reading and comprehension (no AI summaries for synthesis material)
- Cross-domain connection recognition (creative insight)
- Framework architecture design (conceptual elegance)
- Explanatory power assessment (does this clarify?)
- Essay writing and argumentation (intellectual craft)
- Quality judgment (is this framework beautiful?)

### C. Calibration Principle

AI assists with structure and organization. Human judgment provides synthesis, connection-making, and conceptual elegance. The frameworks that emerge are genuinely novel insights, not AI-generated content.
