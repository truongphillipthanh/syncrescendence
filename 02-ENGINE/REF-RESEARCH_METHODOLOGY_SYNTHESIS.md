## Part I: Process Archaeology

### The Genealogy of This Methodology

This document formalizes the methodology that produced the Claude Code Unified Research Coalescence—a 1,031-line synthesis representing the most comprehensive public documentation on Claude Code architecture as of January 2026. The process transformed 13 distinct AI research outputs across 5 frontier platforms into a unified knowledge artifact, subsequently bifurcated into audience-optimized derivatives.

The methodology emerged organically through iterative refinement, but its patterns are reproducible. What follows is both retrospective analysis and prospective specification.

         │ (Manual transcription from X, forums, documentation)   │
         ↓                                                        │

### Phase-by-Phase Reconstruction

#### Phase 0: Primary Source Aggregation

**What Happened:**
Manual transcription of practitioner reports from X (Twitter), aggregator threads, community forums, and first-party Anthropic documentation. Primary sources preserved verbatim.

**Why This Mattered:**
The raw corpus contained signal that would be lost in summarization. Direct quotes, specific configurations, exact error messages—these details matter for validation. By preserving primary sources, you created a verifiable foundation rather than building on someone else's lossy synthesis.

**Cost:** High manual effort. This is the rate-limiting step.

**Critical Insight:** Some aggregators on X had already done partial curation. These "based enough to aggregate" individuals provided entry points that would otherwise require exhaustive manual search.

**Artifacts Produced:**
- Raw transcriptions (verbatim)
- Source attribution records
- Temporal markers (when claims were made)

---

#### Phase 1: Convergence Synthesis

**Prompt Pattern:**
> "Holistically inspect/examine the corpus of research files to elucidate and interpolate points of convergence. The goal is to produce the definitive [Topic] Guide. Identify where ideas rhyme or repeat and determine how to unify those tactics into principles, while preserving every coherent/efficacious unique insight and productive tension."

**What Happened:**
First pass at pattern recognition across the corpus. Looking for convergent solutions—where independent practitioners arrived at the same answer through different paths.

**Key Methodological Choice:**
The instruction to preserve "productive tension" rather than resolve all disagreements. This prevented premature consensus that would have lost valuable nuance.

**Output Structure:**
- Convergent patterns (high confidence)
- Emergent principles (abstracted from tactics)
- Unique insights (preserved individually)
- Productive tensions (flagged, not resolved)

---

#### Phase 2: Dialectic Divergence

**Prompt Pattern:**
> "Now, identify all the points of divergence to conduct a dialectic. Reason through the debate to determine the merits and tradeoffs of each approach. Then propose a solution forward."

**What Happened:**
Explicit examination of contradictions. Rather than averaging away disagreements, the methodology staged a debate to understand *why* credible sources recommended different approaches.

**Key Methodological Choice:**
Not all tensions should be resolved. Some represent genuine context-dependent tradeoffs. The methodology distinguished between:
- **False contradictions:** Different terminology, same concept
- **Genuine tensions:** Different approaches for different contexts
- **Errors:** One source simply wrong (requires triangulation)

**Output Structure:**
- Position mapping (who says what)
- Merit analysis (why each position makes sense)
- Tradeoff articulation (when to use which)
- Resolution proposals (where possible)
- Preserved tensions (where resolution would be false)

---

#### Phase 3: Configuration Materialization

**Prompt Pattern:**
> "'Stealing' as much as possible from the research corpus, create as many of the 'config' files as possible, in a way that is coherent to our elucidations."

**What Happened:**
Translation from understanding to artifact. Abstract principles became concrete files (settings.json, CLAUDE.md templates, hooks, skills).

**Why This Mattered:**
Forces specificity. You can't write a settings.json with vague principles. The act of materialization revealed gaps in understanding and forced disambiguation of tensions.

**Output Structure:**
- Configuration files (deployable)
- Template structures (adaptable)
- Anti-pattern flags (what to avoid)
- Graduated profiles (novice → expert)

---

#### Phase 4: Meta-Prompt Engineering

**Prompt Pattern:**
> "Compounding upon our elucidations from the entire thread, create a multi-step deep research prompt that will elicit:
> - effective validation and deepening of understanding via first party official documentation
> - then, once ascertained, propose other avenues of inquiry (community, antipatterns—BUT SUGGEST NOVEL SUPERINTELLIGENT research paths!)
> - then actually conduct said research to illuminate superintelligent enhancements to the definitive guide."

**What Happened:**
Instead of directly asking for more research, the methodology engineered prompts that would *produce* more research. Meta-level optimization.

**Key Methodological Choice:**
The three-part structure (validate → expand → conduct) created a forcing function for rigor:
1. **Validation:** Ground in official sources first
2. **Expansion:** Identify novel research vectors
3. **Execution:** Actually conduct the research

**Output Structure:**
- 3 variant Deep Research prompts
- Each optimized for different aspects
- Designed for cross-platform execution

---

#### Phase 5: Distributed Execution

**What Happened:**
The 3 meta-prompts were executed across 5 frontier platforms: Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity.

**Mathematics:** 3 prompts × 5 platforms = 15 distinct research outputs

**Why Distribute:**
- Different training data → Different blind spots covered
- Different tool access → Different source discovery
- Different reasoning styles → Different insights surface
- Triangulation → Higher confidence in convergent findings

**Platform-Specific Execution:**
| Platform | Interface | Strengths Leveraged |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| Claude | Web App (Projects) | Dense document synthesis, Project Files for corpus |
| ChatGPT | Web + Deep Research | Structured output, broad web coverage |
| Gemini | AI Studio | Long context (1M+), Google ecosystem access |
| Grok | X Integration | Native X/Twitter access, real-time discourse |
| Perplexity | Pro Search | Citation discipline, source triangulation |

---

#### Phase 6: Multi-Stage Coalescence

**What Happened:**
- **First collapse:** 5 platform outputs per prompt → 1 unified synthesis (×3)
- **Second collapse:** 3 unified syntheses → 1 master coalescence

**Why Multi-Stage:**
Direct 15→1 collapse would exceed context limits and lose nuance. The staged approach allowed each intermediate synthesis to preserve detail before final integration.

**Coalescence Protocol:**
```xml
<coalescence_principles>
  <preservation>Maintain productive tensions as navigable dimensions</preservation>
  <attribution>Track which platform/iteration contributed what</attribution>
  <verification>Label confidence levels for each claim</verification>
  <uniqueness>Preserve every efficacious unique insight</uniqueness>
</coalescence_principles>
```

**Output:** 1,031-line unified document with 21 major sections

---

#### Phase 7: Audience Bifurcation

**Prompt Pattern:**
> "Bifurcate this research. One version will be read by the LLM. These should be highly strategic and tactical technical implementation manual. The other will be read by the human in the loop. This should be an onboarding/orientation."

**What Happened:**
The unified research was transformed into two derivative documents optimized for different readers:
- **LLM Manual (617 lines):** Directive language, decision trees, quantified thresholds
- **Human Handbook (560 lines):** Pedagogical, metaphor-rich, paradigm-shift focused

**Why This Mattered:**
A research synthesis and an operational manual have different requirements. Separating them allowed each to be optimized for its purpose without compromise.

---

## Part II: Platform Contribution Analysis

### The Chorus Model (What Happened)

Each platform received identical prompts and produced independent outputs. This is "chorus"—same input, parallel execution, subsequent integration.

### Observed Platform Contributions

| Platform | Distinctive Contribution | Blind Spots |
|----------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Claude** | Nuance preservation, tension maintenance, architectural reasoning | Limited real-time web access |
| **ChatGPT** | Structured categorization, official doc validation, broad coverage | Sometimes over-confident claims |
| **Gemini** | Technical specifications, version-specific details, Google ecosystem | Less practitioner wisdom |
| **Grok** | X/Twitter discourse, community patterns, anti-patterns, viral threads | Recency bias, less documentation focus |
| **Perplexity** | Citation discipline, explicit confidence levels, source triangulation | Shallower synthesis depth |

### What the Chorus Achieved

The ensemble produced findings no single platform would have surfaced:

1. **The January 2026 thinking keyword correction** — Grok/Perplexity had newer training data
2. **The 4-level vs 5-level hierarchy correction** — ChatGPT/Gemini cross-referenced official docs
3. **Community antipatterns catalog** — Grok's X access was essential
4. **Verification status matrix** — Perplexity's citation rigor forced explicit confidence levels
5. **Architectural coherence** — Claude maintained tensions others would have resolved prematurely

### Where the Chorus Was Inefficient

**Redundant Discovery:** All five platforms independently "discovered" the same well-documented features, wasting tokens on parallel retrieval of identical information.

**Uncoordinated Depth:** Without specialization directives, each platform attempted comprehensive coverage rather than deep dives into their strength areas.

**Citation Format Variance:** Each platform cited differently, requiring manual normalization during coalescence.

**Blind Spot Overlap:** Some areas (Windows-specific paths, enterprise tier features) were under-researched by all platforms, suggesting shared training data gaps.

---

## Part III: Bottleneck Identification

### Critical Path Bottlenecks

#### Bottleneck 1: Manual Primary Source Aggregation

The "painstaking manual transcription" is the highest-friction phase. It doesn't scale. For future research topics, this phase will always be rate-limiting.

**Friction Points:**
- Identifying high-value sources requires domain expertise
- X/Twitter threads are ephemeral and hard to search systematically
- Forum posts are scattered across Reddit, Discord, HN, etc.
- No unified search across all practitioner discourse

**Current Mitigation:** Finding aggregators who have already curated ("based enough to aggregate")

---

#### Bottleneck 2: Token Limits in Coalescence

The 15→3→1 staging was necessary because no single context window could hold all outputs simultaneously. Each stage introduced lossy compression.

**Current Limits:**
- Claude Web App: ~200K tokens (with Projects)
- ChatGPT: ~128K tokens
- Gemini AI Studio: ~1M tokens (but synthesis quality varies)
- NotebookLM: ~50 sources, purpose-built for synthesis

**Friction Points:**
- Multi-session synthesis loses conversational context
- Staged compression introduces information loss
- No good way to maintain "working memory" across coalescence

---

#### Bottleneck 3: Platform Output Format Variance

Different platforms produce different structures, requiring manual normalization before coalescence can proceed.

**Friction Points:**
- No standard schema for research outputs
- Citation formats vary wildly
- Confidence articulation differs
- Heading structures incompatible

---

#### Bottleneck 4: Human Review Serialization

Each coalescence phase required human review before proceeding. This created serial dependencies where parallel would be possible.

**Friction Points:**
- Quality gates require human judgment
- No automated "good enough to proceed" detection
- Human attention is the scarcest resource

---

### Leverage Points

**Leverage Point 1: Prompt Engineering Quality**
The research prompt (Phase 4) determined the quality of all downstream outputs. Investment here has 15× multiplier (once per prompt, executed by 5 platforms on 3 variants).

**Leverage Point 2: Coalescence Strategy**
How the 15 outputs are merged determines what survives. The "preservative coalescence" instruction (maintain tensions, preserve unique insights) was high-value.

**Leverage Point 3: Platform Selection**
Different research topics benefit from different platform mixes. Claude Code research benefited from Grok's X access. Medical research might benefit more from Perplexity's citation discipline.

---

## Part IV: The Medley Model (Proposed Evolution)

### From Chorus to Medley

**Chorus:** Same prompt to all platforms, integrate outputs afterward.
**Medley:** Specialized prompts per platform, coordinated execution, structured integration.

### Platform Specialization Matrix

| Platform | Specialized Role | Optimized Prompt Style |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Grok** | Community discourse mining | "Search X for practitioner reports about [topic]. Focus on: implementation details, gotchas, anti-patterns, workarounds. Prioritize threads with high engagement." |
| **Perplexity** | Web source triangulation | "Find and cite authoritative sources for [claims]. Explicitly mark confidence levels. Flag contradictions between sources." |
| **ChatGPT** | Official documentation validation | "Validate these claims against official documentation. For each claim: CONFIRMED, DISPUTED, or UNVERIFIED. Cite specific docs." |
| **Gemini** | Technical specification extraction | "Extract precise technical specifications: version numbers, token limits, API parameters, file paths. Use 1M context for comprehensive doc analysis." |
| **Claude** | Tension-preserving synthesis | "Integrate these sources using preservative coalescence. Maintain productive tensions as navigable dimensions. Preserve unique insights." |
| **NotebookLM** | Corpus management & overview | "Analyze uploaded sources. Generate: FAQ, timeline, study guide, audio overview. Identify gaps in coverage." |

## Part V: Tool Landscape (January 2026)

### Agentic Platforms for Methodology Replication

The emergence of multiple agentic CLI/desktop tools creates new possibilities for automating this methodology.

#### Claude Code
**Role:** Primary synthesis engine, CLAUDE.md-based persistent memory
**Strengths:** Best reasoning for complex synthesis, skills architecture, MCP integration

**Role:** Parallel to Claude Code in OpenAI ecosystem
**Strengths:** `AGENTS.md` configuration, web search, cloud task delegation, GPT-5.2-Codex model
**Configuration:** `~/.codex/config.toml`, MCP servers
**Key Feature:** Can run as MCP server itself, enabling agent-to-agent orchestration
**Limitation:** Less nuanced synthesis than Claude

#### Gemini CLI (Google)
**Role:** Long-context corpus analysis, Google ecosystem integration
**Strengths:** 1M token context, `GEMINI.md` system prompts, free tier generous (60 req/min, 1000/day)
**Configuration:** `~/.gemini/settings.json`, MCP support
**Key Feature:** Deep Research via web, native Google Drive/Docs integration, Gemini 3 Pro/Flash models
**Limitation:** Synthesis quality varies at extreme context lengths

#### Cowork (Anthropic)
**Role:** Desktop automation, file operations, non-developer workflows
**Strengths:** Folder-level filesystem access, Claude in Chrome browser automation, Skills framework
**Configuration:** Folder mounting, connector integrations (Asana, Notion, PayPal, etc.)
**Key Feature:** Multi-agent spawning for parallel subtasks, runs in VM for isolation
**Limitation:** macOS only (currently), no memory between sessions, Claude Max required ($100-200/mo)

#### Moltbot (née Clawdbot)
**Role:** Persistent AI assistant across messaging platforms
**Strengths:** Multi-channel (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Signal, iMessage, etc.), proactive outreach, persistent memory, 50+ integrations
**Configuration:** `~/.clawdbot/credentials`, skills via ClawdHub, gateway architecture
**Key Feature:** 24/7 background operation, session persistence, local-first privacy
**Limitation:** Security concerns (prompt injection vectors, exposed control panels), requires self-hosting, recent trademark drama (Clawdbot → Moltbot rename January 27, 2026)

#### NotebookLM (Google)
**Role:** Corpus ingestion and synthesis for large document sets
**Strengths:** 50 sources, audio overviews, Deep Research (November 2025), mind maps, citations, source-grounded (won't hallucinate beyond sources)
**Configuration:** Notebook-based, source-grounded
**Key Feature:** "Fast Research" (30-45 sec) and "Deep Research" (3-5 min) modes
**Limitation:** No direct API, manual interaction required, Gemini 2.5 for reasoning (not 3 Pro yet)

---

## Part VI: Kaizen Proposals

### Proposal 1: Structured Platform Specialization (Medley)

**Current State:** Same prompt to all platforms (chorus)
**Proposed State:** Specialized prompts per platform (medley)

**Implementation:**
```yaml
medley_config:
  discovery_phase:
    grok:
      prompt_type: "community_discourse_mining"
      target: "X/Twitter practitioner threads"
      output_schema: "antipatterns, workarounds, implementation_details"
    perplexity:
      prompt_type: "web_triangulation"
      target: "authoritative sources"
      output_schema: "claims, citations, confidence_levels"
  
  validation_phase:
    chatgpt:
      prompt_type: "official_doc_validation"
      target: "first-party documentation"
      output_schema: "claim_status, doc_citations, disputes"
    gemini:
      prompt_type: "technical_spec_extraction"
      target: "version-specific specifications"
      output_schema: "parameters, limits, paths, versions"
  
  synthesis_phase:
    claude:
      prompt_type: "preservative_coalescence"
      target: "all previous outputs"
      output_schema: "unified_document, tensions_preserved, unique_insights"
```

**Expected Improvement:** 30-40% reduction in redundant discovery, deeper coverage in specialized areas

---

### Proposal 2: Automated Primary Source Aggregation

**Current State:** Manual transcription ("painstaking")
**Proposed State:** Semi-automated discovery with human curation

**Implementation Stack:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         SOURCE DISCOVERY LAYER          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Grok API       → X/Twitter discourse    │
│ Perplexity Pro → Web + Reddit access    │
│ Manus          → Forum scraping         │
│ GitHub Search  → Issues, discussions    │
│ HN Algolia API → Hacker News threads    │
│ Discord Bots   → Server archives        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    │
                    ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          CURATION CHECKPOINT            │
│  (Human reviews discovered sources)     │
│  (Marks: high-value, low-value, skip)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    │
                    ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         CORPUS INGESTION                │
│  NotebookLM / Claude Projects / Gemini  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Insight:** Perplexity Pro has Reddit access. Grok has native X access. Combining these with MCP servers for GitHub and HN could cover most practitioner discourse.

**Expected Improvement:** 70% reduction in manual aggregation time

---

### Proposal 3: Token-Efficient Staged Coalescence

**Current State:** 15→3→1 staging with manual context management
**Proposed State:** Optimized staging using platform-specific context strengths

**Implementation:**
```
Stage 1: Per-Platform Summary (on each platform)
         Claude: 5 outputs → summary
         ChatGPT: 5 outputs → summary  
         (etc.)
         
Stage 2: Cross-Platform Integration (Gemini AI Studio, 1M context)
         All Stage 1 summaries → single context
         
Stage 3: Tension-Preserving Synthesis (Claude Projects)
         Gemini output + original high-value sources
         
Stage 4: Audience Bifurcation (Claude)
         Master synthesis → LLM Manual + Human Handbook
```

**Key Insight:** Gemini's 1M context can hold ALL intermediate outputs simultaneously, eliminating staged compression loss.

**Expected Improvement:** 50% reduction in information loss during coalescence

---

### Proposal 4: Verification Status Automation

**Current State:** Manual labeling of claims (CONFIRMED, DISPUTED, UNVERIFIED)
**Proposed State:** Automated verification pipeline

**Implementation:**
```python
verification_pipeline:
  for each claim in synthesis:
    1. Extract claim as atomic statement
    2. Query official docs (ChatGPT/Gemini)
    3. Query community sources (Grok/Perplexity)
    4. Compare responses:
       - All agree → CONFIRMED
       - Disagreement → DISPUTED (preserve both positions)
       - No sources → UNVERIFIED (flag for investigation)
    5. Attach verification metadata to claim
```

**Expected Improvement:** Consistent verification status, reduced human review burden

---

### Proposal 5: Cross-Platform Orchestration Protocol

**Current State:** Manual coordination between platforms
**Proposed State:** Agent-based orchestration using MCP

**Implementation:**
```yaml
orchestration_protocol:
  coordinator: claude_code  # or codex_cli
  
  mcp_servers:
    - name: codex_as_mcp
      transport: stdio
      capabilities: [code_execution, web_search, task_delegation]
    
    - name: gemini_via_api
      transport: http
      capabilities: [long_context_analysis, google_search]
    
    - name: perplexity_mcp  # hypothetical
      transport: http
      capabilities: [web_search, citations]
  
  workflow:
    1. coordinator.dispatch(discovery_tasks, parallel=true)
    2. await all_complete
    3. coordinator.collect(outputs)
    4. coordinator.dispatch(validation_tasks, parallel=true)
    5. await all_complete
    6. coordinator.synthesize(all_outputs)
```

**Key Insight:** Codex CLI can run as MCP server. Claude Code supports MCP. Cross-platform orchestration is technically feasible now.

**Expected Improvement:** Fully automated multi-platform research with human-on-the-loop

---

## Part VII: Superintelligent Enhancements

Beyond incremental Kaizen, the methodology admits transformative enhancements that leverage emergent capabilities.

### Enhancement 1: Recursive Methodology Improvement

The methodology that produced the Claude Code synthesis can analyze itself.

**Implementation:**
```
meta_prompt = """
Analyze this methodology document. Identify:
1. Implicit assumptions that should be explicit
2. Missing phases that would improve output quality
3. Inefficiencies that compound across iterations
4. Novel research vectors the methodology doesn't explore

Then: Produce an improved version of the methodology.
"""

# Execute across platforms, integrate improvements, repeat
```

**Outcome:** Self-improving methodology that evolves with each application

---

### Enhancement 2: Predictive Gap Analysis

Instead of discovering gaps during synthesis, predict them before research begins.

**Implementation:**
```
gap_prediction_prompt = """
Given this research topic: [TOPIC]

Predict:
1. What questions will practitioners have that documentation doesn't answer?
2. What edge cases will cause confusion?
3. What deprecated information will contaminate search results?
4. What terminology variations will fragment the discourse?

Then: Design targeted queries to fill each predicted gap.
"""
```

**Outcome:** Front-loaded discovery that reduces iteration cycles

---

### Enhancement 3: Adversarial Validation

Instead of seeking consensus, actively seek contradiction.

**Implementation:**
```
adversarial_prompt = """
Your task is to DISPROVE these claims from the synthesis:
[CLAIMS]

For each claim, find:
1. Contradicting evidence from official sources
2. Edge cases where the claim fails
3. Version-specific contexts where the claim is outdated
4. Practitioner reports that contradict the claim

If you cannot disprove a claim after exhaustive search, it is hardened.
"""
```

**Outcome:** Claims that survive adversarial validation have higher epistemic status

---

### Enhancement 4: Temporal Versioning

Research syntheses decay as their subjects evolve. Build in temporal awareness.

**Implementation:**
```yaml
temporal_metadata:
  synthesis_date: "2026-01-29"
  subject_version: "Claude Code v2.x (post-January 2026 architecture)"
  
  decay_signals:
    - keyword: "extended thinking keywords"
      status: "OUTDATED as of January 2026"
      replacement: "thinking now auto-enabled at 31,999 tokens"
    
    - keyword: "ultrathink"
      status: "LEGACY/COSMETIC"
      notes: "community still using; no functional effect"
  
  refresh_triggers:
    - "New Anthropic documentation release"
    - "Major version increment"
    - "Community reports of changed behavior"
```

**Outcome:** Syntheses that know when they're becoming stale

---

### Enhancement 5: Practitioner Feedback Loop

The synthesis should be tested by practitioners and improved based on results.

**Implementation:**
```
feedback_integration:
  1. Publish synthesis to community (GitHub, forum post)
  2. Collect practitioner reports:
     - "This worked as described"
     - "This didn't work, here's what happened"
     - "This is missing: [gap]"
  3. Integrate feedback into next synthesis version
  4. Track which sources produced accurate vs inaccurate claims
  5. Weight sources accordingly in future research
```

**Outcome:** Synthesis quality improves with each deployment cycle

---

### Enhancement 6: Swarm Intelligence Integration

Leverage the emerging multi-agent tooling (claude-flow, parallel-cc, etc.) for research.

**Implementation:**
```yaml
research_swarm:
  topology: hierarchical
  
  coordinator:
    role: "Research Director"
    platform: claude_code
    responsibilities:
      - task_decomposition
      - quality_gates
      - final_synthesis
  
  specialists:
    - role: "Documentation Validator"
      platform: chatgpt_codex
      task: "Validate claims against official docs"
    
    - role: "Community Scout"
      platform: grok
      task: "Mine X/Twitter for practitioner wisdom"
    
    - role: "Citation Auditor"
      platform: perplexity
      task: "Verify and format all citations"
    
    - role: "Spec Extractor"
      platform: gemini_cli
      task: "Extract technical specifications"
  
  communication:
    protocol: git_commits  # or shared filesystem
    sync_frequency: per_phase
```

**Outcome:** Parallel research execution with specialized agents

## Part VIII: Standard Operating Procedure

### SOP for Distributed Cognition Research Synthesis

#### Prerequisites
- [ ] Topic clearly defined
- [ ] Success criteria established
- [ ] Platform access confirmed (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity)
- [ ] Long-context platform available (Gemini AI Studio or NotebookLM)
- [ ] Synthesis platform available (Claude Projects)

#### Phase 0: Primary Source Aggregation (2-8 hours)

**Automated Discovery:**
```bash
# Grok: X/Twitter discourse
grok search "[topic] implementation" --timeframe 6m --min-engagement 50

# Perplexity: Web triangulation  
perplexity search "[topic] tutorial OR guide OR gotcha" --pro --citations

# GitHub: Issues and discussions
gh search issues "[topic]" --sort interactions --limit 50
```

**Manual Curation:**
1. Review discovered sources
2. Mark: HIGH_VALUE, LOW_VALUE, SKIP
3. Transcribe HIGH_VALUE sources to corpus

**Output:** `corpus/raw_sources/` directory

---

#### Phase 1: Convergence Synthesis (1-2 hours)

**Prompt Template:**
```
Holistically inspect/examine this corpus of research materials to elucidate 
and interpolate points of convergence. 

Goal: Produce the definitive [TOPIC] guide.

Instructions:
1. Identify where ideas rhyme or repeat across sources
2. Unify tactics into principles
3. Preserve every coherent/efficacious unique insight
4. Flag productive tensions (do not resolve them)

Output Structure:
- Convergent Patterns (high confidence)
- Emergent Principles (abstracted from tactics)  
- Unique Insights (preserved individually)
- Productive Tensions (flagged for dialectic)
```

**Platform:** Claude (Projects) or Gemini AI Studio
**Output:** `synthesis/01_convergence.md`

---

#### Phase 2: Dialectic Divergence (1-2 hours)

**Prompt Template:**
```
Based on the convergence synthesis, now identify all points of divergence 
to conduct a dialectic.

For each divergence:
1. Articulate each position clearly
2. Identify the merit of each approach
3. Identify the tradeoffs
4. Propose resolution OR preserve tension with navigation guidance

Output Structure:
- Divergence: [description]
  - Position A: [claim] (Source: [])
  - Position B: [claim] (Source: [])
  - Merit Analysis: [why each makes sense]
  - Tradeoff: [when to use which]
  - Resolution: [if possible] OR Preserved Tension: [navigation guidance]
```

**Platform:** Claude (best at nuance)
**Output:** `synthesis/02_dialectic.md`

---

#### Phase 3: Configuration Materialization (2-4 hours)

**Prompt Template:**
```
Based on the synthesis so far, create deployable configuration artifacts.

"Steal" as much as possible from the research corpus to produce:
1. Configuration files (actual, working configs)
2. Templates (adaptable starting points)
3. Anti-pattern flags (what to avoid)
4. Graduated profiles (novice → intermediate → expert)

Each artifact should:
- Be immediately usable
- Include inline comments explaining choices
- Reference synthesis sections that informed the choice
```

**Platform:** Claude Code or Codex CLI (for validation)
**Output:** `artifacts/configs/`

---

#### Phase 4: Meta-Prompt Engineering (1 hour)

**Create 3 variant prompts optimized for:**
1. **Validation Focus:** Emphasize official documentation verification
2. **Expansion Focus:** Emphasize novel research vectors
3. **Depth Focus:** Emphasize deep technical specification extraction

**Template Structure:**
```
[CONTEXT: Summary of synthesis so far]

[PHASE 1: VALIDATION]
Validate these claims against official documentation:
[CLAIMS]
For each: CONFIRMED | DISPUTED | UNVERIFIED with citations.

[PHASE 2: EXPANSION]  
Identify research vectors not covered:
- Community antipatterns
- Edge cases
- Version-specific behaviors
- Novel/superintelligent enhancements

[PHASE 3: EXECUTION]
Conduct the expanded research. For each vector:
- Findings
- Sources  
- Confidence level
- Integration recommendation
```

**Output:** `prompts/deep_research_{1,2,3}.md`

---

#### Phase 5: Distributed Execution (2-4 hours)

**Execute each prompt across platforms:**

| Prompt | Claude | ChatGPT | Gemini | Grok | Perplexity |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|------|------------|
| Validation | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Expansion | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Depth | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**Collect outputs:** `research_outputs/{platform}/{prompt}.md`

---

#### Phase 6: Multi-Stage Coalescence (2-4 hours)

**Stage 6a: Per-Prompt Integration**
```
For each prompt (1, 2, 3):
  Integrate outputs from all 5 platforms
  Using: Preservative coalescence (maintain tensions)
  Output: synthesis/06a_prompt{n}_integrated.md
```

**Stage 6b: Cross-Prompt Synthesis**
```
Integrate all 3 prompt integrations
Platform: Gemini AI Studio (1M context) or Claude Projects
Using: Same preservative coalescence principles
Output: synthesis/06b_master_coalescence.md
```

**Verification Pass:**
```
Review master coalescence for:
- Claim verification status (CONFIRMED/DISPUTED/UNVERIFIED)
- Source attribution completeness
- Tension preservation
- Unique insight preservation
```

---

#### Phase 7: Audience Bifurcation (1-2 hours)

**LLM Manual Prompt:**
```
Transform this synthesis into an operational manual for an LLM.

Requirements:
- Directive language (NEVER, ALWAYS, DO, DO NOT)
- Decision trees for autonomous operation
- Quantified thresholds and constraints
- Emergency protocols with specific commands
- Self-governance patterns
- No explanatory prose—pure operational specification
```

**Human Handbook Prompt:**
```
Transform this synthesis into an orientation guide for a human.

Requirements:
- Pedagogical progression (concepts before applications)
- Metaphors that build intuition
- Paradigm shift framing
- Mental models section
- Common traps and how to avoid them
- Growth trajectory (beginner → expert)
```

**Outputs:**
- `deliverables/LLM_OPERATIONS_MANUAL.md`
- `deliverables/HUMAN_ORIENTATION_HANDBOOK.md`

## Appendix A: Prompt Library

### Convergence Synthesis Prompt
```
Holistically inspect/examine the corpus of research files to elucidate and 
interpolate points of convergence. The goal is to produce the definitive 
[TOPIC] Guide. Identify where ideas rhyme or repeat and determine how to 
unify those tactics into principles, while preserving every coherent/efficacious 
unique insight and productive tension.
```

### Dialectic Divergence Prompt
```
Now, identify all the points of divergence to conduct a dialectic. Reason 
through the debate to determine the merits and tradeoffs of each approach. 
Then propose a solution forward.
```

### Preservative Coalescence Prompt
```
Integrate these research outputs using preservative coalescence.

Principles:
1. PRESERVE productive tensions as navigable dimensions, not false choices
2. MAINTAIN unique insights even if they appear only in one source
3. ATTRIBUTE findings to specific sources/platforms
4. LABEL verification status: CONFIRMED | DISPUTED | UNVERIFIED
5. STRUCTURE for both reference lookup and linear reading

Do NOT:
- Average away disagreements into false consensus
- Discard minority positions that have merit
- Lose specificity in favor of generality
- Resolve tensions that represent genuine context-dependence
```

### Audience Bifurcation Prompts

**LLM Manual:**
```
Bifurcate this research for LLM consumption. Create a highly strategic and 
tactical technical implementation manual. Use directive language, decision 
trees, quantified thresholds, and emergency protocols. No explanatory prose—
pure operational specification.
```

**Human Handbook:**
```
Bifurcate this research for human consumption. Create an onboarding/orientation 
guide. The user just received agentic intelligence the equivalent of a spaceship. 
Use pedagogical progression, metaphors that build intuition, mental models, and 
growth trajectories.
```

## Appendix C: Glossary

**Chorus Model:** Same prompt executed across multiple platforms, outputs integrated afterward.

**Medley Model:** Specialized prompts per platform based on comparative advantage, coordinated execution.

**Preservative Coalescence:** Integration methodology that maintains productive tensions rather than resolving them into false consensus.

**Productive Tension:** A disagreement between sources that represents genuine context-dependence rather than error. Both positions have merit in different situations.

**Verification Status:** Confidence label for claims:
- CONFIRMED: Multiple authoritative sources agree
- DISPUTED: Sources disagree; both positions preserved
- UNVERIFIED: No authoritative source found; community wisdom only

**Audience Bifurcation:** Transformation of unified research into audience-specific derivatives (e.g., LLM Manual vs Human Handbook).

**Human-on-the-Loop:** Supervision model where human reviews outputs at checkpoints rather than controlling each step.

**Context Rot:** Degradation of reasoning quality as context window fills, particularly above 70% utilization.
