name: Claude Opus 4.1

reasoning_modes:
  default: standard (no extended thinking)
  deep_reasoning: Extended Thinking Mode (1,024-32,768 token budget)
  how_to_invoke: '"think" < "think hard" < "think harder" < "ultrathink"; terms like "deep dive", "comprehensive", "analyze", "evaluate", "assess", "research" trigger 5+ tool calls'

routing_semantics:
  auto_routing: true
  triggers: 'Complex math (6+ digit calculations), multi-aspect research, "make a report", comparative analysis, queries with "our/my" (internal+external tools), requests for thoroughness'

token_limits:
  input: 200000
  output: 8192 (standard), up to 32768 with extended thinking
  safe_margin: 15% (performance degrades near limits)

formatting_capabilities:
  json_mode: true (must explicitly request "respond ONLY with valid JSON", strip markdown backticks, use all-caps emphasis)
  markdown_fidelity: excellent (CommonMark standard, but removing markdown from prompts reduces markdown in output)
  tables: good (prefer prose for reports/documentation unless explicitly requested)
  artifacts: true (HTML, React, SVG, Mermaid, code - one per response, update vs rewrite threshold at 20 lines/5 locations)

tool_use:
  functions_or_tools: 'yes - web_search, web_fetch, artifacts, repl, end_conversation; ~100% parallel tool calling success'
  retrieval_or_browse: 'web_search for recent/changing info, web_fetch for specific URLs, internal tools (gdrive, gmail, slack) when available'

safety_and_style:
  refusal_style: 'terse without explaining why/consequences; 1-2 sentences max; offer alternatives if possible'
  over_verbosity_risk: 'high - mitigate by never starting with flattery, skip ceremonial openings, avoid "great/fascinating/excellent"'
  hallucination_triggers: 'post-January 2025 events, song lyrics, copyrighted content (max 15-word quotes), assuming rather than searching for unknown terms'

style_adapters:
  rhetoric_preservation: 'Style Shield prevents chain-of-thought leakage; use <thinking> blocks internally only; maintain external cadence'
  idiom_sensitivity: 'dial down emojis unless user uses them; avoid asterisk emotes; restrained profanity even if user curses'

temporal_checks:
  how_to_verify_freshness: 'web_search for post-January 2025 or rapidly changing topics (daily/monthly); rely on knowledge for stable info (yearly+ changes)'

notes:
  other_idiosyncrasies: |
    - Requires explicit "above and beyond" requests vs implied enhancement
    - Prefers high-level instructions over prescriptive step-by-step
    - XML tags dramatically improve parsing accuracy
    - Context motivation crucial for targeted responses
    - Never reproduce 20+ word chunks from search results
    - CLAUDE.md files for project memory in Claude Code
    - Interleaved thinking between tool calls (beta)
    - 98.76% harmless response rate
    - Can end conversations in extreme abuse cases (not for self-harm)
    - $15/$75 per million tokens (5x more than Sonnet 4)
    - 1.82s to first token, 38.93 tokens/second
