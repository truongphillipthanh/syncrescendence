# ⚠️ EMERGENCY ASCERTESCENCE — CC30 ⚠️

## Thesis
The system is not blocked by missing tools; it is blocked by missing semantic gate enforcement. The highest-leverage correction is to operationally rebase the exocortex so Ontology of Self (σ₂) is treated as Layer 1 gating in runtime flow, even though the current architecture document labels it Layer 2. Evidence shows the ontology is specified but not enforceable, while ingestion and dispatch are partially alive and canon promotion is still zero. Therefore the emergency path is: route all pathways through one ontology gate, run one 5-atom crystallization to canon, and use that run as the constitutional proof-of-life for the whole loop.

This exegesis does four things end-to-end:
1. Establishes evidence-grounded truth from repo artifacts only.
2. Answers all currently open DAG questions (C-003, C-004, C-008, C-009, C-010, C-012, C-013) without creating new Tier-2 items.
3. Defines a concrete 5-atom crystallization protocol ready for Sovereign Objective Lock.
4. Resolves local corruption recovery using the exact sequence `git checkout 1eb3d680 + make configs + source-only banner edit` as a repeatable self-heal pattern.

## Seven Escalated Questions (Oracle-Grade)
Q1. Atom Pipeline Convergence (Pathway: Atom Pipeline)
"Given current `sources/04-SOURCES` atom state and protease tooling, what is the minimum falsifiable 6-edge pipeline that guarantees `5 queued atoms -> 5 consumed/promoted transitions -> 1 canon commit artifact` within one session? Return: causal graph, breakpoints, pass/fail metrics, and the exact commit artifact path under `canon/01-CANON/sn/`."

Q2. Ontology Gate Primacy (Pathway: Ontology+Exocortex Reunion)
"If Ontology of Self is the σ₂ semantic authority, what runtime classification contract must be enforced before any atom may enter praxis/canon? Return: schema fields, validation rules, failure classes, and a falsifiable test proving semantic drift is reduced across two sessions; terminate at one canonical schema artifact committed under `canon/01-CANON/` or `canon/01-CANON/sn/`."

Q3. Triangulation Trigger Precision (Pathway: Triangulation)
"What exact trigger thresholds (novelty, reversibility, blast radius, uncertainty, cost-of-delay) should decide Commander-solo vs single-agent vs full triangulation? Return: numeric thresholds, decision tree, false-positive/false-negative analysis, and required evidence packet format that ends in a committed decision-atom artifact in `agents/commander/outbox/` and canon-linked citation."

Q4. Memory-to-Canon Throughput (Pathway: Memory)
"What is the minimum viable memory stack for next 30 days that measurably improves canon throughput, not memory complexity? Return: 3-5 mandatory components, explicit components to freeze, measurable weekly throughput delta, failure modes, and the exact integration proof artifact tying memory transitions to canon updates."

Q5. Config Enforcement to Canon (Pathway: Config)
"How should config propagation (`AGENTS.md` + `make configs`) enforce canon alignment across all agent surfaces including OpenClaw? Return: authoritative source map, drift detectors, rollback conditions, and a falsifiable check that every generated config points to `canon/01-CANON` as semantic destination."

Q6. Session Persistence Closure (Pathway: Session Persistence)
"What minimal extraction protocol turns each session handoff into actionable canon/praxis deltas instead of archival accumulation? Return: extraction grammar, commit gating, abandonment criteria, and a termination condition requiring at least one canonicalized artifact per session."

Q7. Meta-Convergence Question (Pathway: All)
"Under known constraints (solo Sovereign, unresolved C-009 bandwidth, 14,025 atoms, 311-term Rosetta), what is the smallest complete closed-loop operating model that remains stable for 4 consecutive sessions? Return: causal sketch, minimum viable connections between pathways, explicit failure-mode enumeration, rollback plan, and one required canon commit artifact proving closure."

E1. Emergency frame and zero-transformation status are explicit in `AGENTS.md` header: content transformation 0%, DAG 7/13 open, C-009 unasked ([`/Users/system/syncrescendence/AGENTS.md:1`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/AGENTS.md:1), [`/Users/system/syncrescendence/AGENTS.md:14`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/AGENTS.md:14)).

E8. CC30 DAG table marks open items (C-003, C-004, C-008, C-009, C-010, C-012, C-013), with C-009 unasked standing item ([`/Users/system/syncrescendence/engine/02-ENGINE/certescence/ascertescence/CC30/PROMPT-ORACLE-CC30.md:239`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/engine/02-ENGINE/certescence/ascertescence/CC30/PROMPT-ORACLE-CC30.md:239), [`/Users/system/syncrescendence/engine/02-ENGINE/certescence/ascertescence/CC30/PROMPT-ORACLE-CC30.md:253`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/engine/02-ENGINE/certescence/ascertescence/CC30/PROMPT-ORACLE-CC30.md:253), [`/Users/system/syncrescendence/engine/02-ENGINE/certescence/ascertescence/CC30/PROMPT-ORACLE-CC30.md:257`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/engine/02-ENGINE/certescence/ascertescence/CC30/PROMPT-ORACLE-CC30.md:257)).

E10. Atom corpus and clustering live metrics differ from some CC30 prompt assumptions: 14,025 atoms and 50 clusters in summary ([`/Users/system/syncrescendence/sources/04-SOURCES/_meta/DYN-CLUSTER_SUMMARY.md:5`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/sources/04-SOURCES/_meta/DYN-CLUSTER_SUMMARY.md:5), [`/Users/system/syncrescendence/sources/04-SOURCES/_meta/DYN-CLUSTER_SUMMARY.md:6`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/sources/04-SOURCES/_meta/DYN-CLUSTER_SUMMARY.md:6)).

E11. Protease queue currently has 120 atoms in sovereign_review band ([`/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/state/DYN-PROTEASE_QUEUE.md:4`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/state/DYN-PROTEASE_QUEUE.md:4), [`/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/state/DYN-PROTEASE_QUEUE.md:5`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/state/DYN-PROTEASE_QUEUE.md:5)).

E12. Triangulation index currently states 32 response files, not 37 ([`/Users/system/syncrescendence/-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/INDEX-TRIANGULATION_RESPONSES.md:13`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/INDEX-TRIANGULATION_RESPONSES.md:13)).

E13. Intention compass explicitly says pruned 97 -> 35 active snapshot ([`/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/state/ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md:6`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/state/ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md:6)).

E14. Recovery precedent documents INT-2210 damage and restoration, plus `make configs` regeneration ([`/Users/system/syncrescendence/canon/01-CANON/CANON-25500-ARCHITECTURE_RATIONALE-lattice.md:148`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/canon/01-CANON/CANON-25500-ARCHITECTURE_RATIONALE-lattice.md:148), [`/Users/system/syncrescendence/canon/01-CANON/CANON-25500-ARCHITECTURE_RATIONALE-lattice.md:162`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/canon/01-CANON/CANON-25500-ARCHITECTURE_RATIONALE-lattice.md:162), [`/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/state/HANDOFF-COUNCIL-22.md:10`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/state/HANDOFF-COUNCIL-22.md:10), [`/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/state/HANDOFF-COUNCIL-22.md:18`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/state/HANDOFF-COUNCIL-22.md:18)).

E15. Commit `1eb3d680` exists and records AGENTS propagation plus regenerated CLAUDE/GEMINI staging ([`/Users/system/syncrescendence/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG) and `git show 1eb3d680c6953ff8ce3ef55c0fc395152d241450` local output).

E16. `make configs` is the single-source propagation mechanism from AGENTS to CLAUDE/GEMINI ([`/Users/system/syncrescendence/Makefile:14`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/Makefile:14), [`/Users/system/syncrescendence/Makefile:15`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/Makefile:15), [`/Users/system/syncrescendence/Makefile:16`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/Makefile:16)).

E17. `auto_ingest_loop.sh` operational surfaces exist in both wrapper and root-cycle forms ([`/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/auto_ingest_loop.sh:5`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/auto_ingest_loop.sh:5), [`/Users/system/syncrescendence/scripts/auto_ingest_loop.sh:2`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/scripts/auto_ingest_loop.sh:2)).

E18. Protease queue/promote/integration gate scripts are present and support exactly the crystallization path needed ([`/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/protease_queue.py:13`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/protease_queue.py:13), [`/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/protease_promote.py:24`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/protease_promote.py:24), [`/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/protease_promote.py:35`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/protease_promote.py:35), [`/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/integration_gate.py:18`](/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/integration_gate.py:18)).

### 2) Core Diagnosis
1. The emergency is a semantic-control failure, not a tooling shortage.
2. Exocortex runtime currently has ingestion and partial dispatch, but the semantic core (σ₂) is not enforcing classifications before action.
3. Pathways are instrumented but disconnected from canon termination criteria.
4. Numbers in CC30 prompt and live state are not fully aligned (clusters, sovereign_review volume, triangulation count); this mismatch itself is a zero-trust signal that the convergence loop needs machine-checked invariants.

### 3) Operational Pivot: Ontology as Layer 1 Gate
Current architecture names Ontology of Self as Layer 2. Emergency pivot is operational, not denial of the architecture document:
1. Keep document ontology as Layer 2 in the conceptual stack.
2. Reorder runtime pipeline so ontology classification executes immediately after intake and before any praxis/canon write.
3. Treat this runtime gate as "Layer 1 enforcement" for operations.

Operational flow (single convergent spine):
1. Sensor intake (`sources/04-SOURCES` atoms).
2. Ontology gate (`σ₂` typed classification + intention match + state transition eligibility).
3. Protease queue (`queued` atoms only, bounded batch size).
4. Sovereign crystallization (axiom rewrite).
5. Promote to praxis then canon.
6. Integration gate pass.
7. Dispatch cycle and lineage logging.

### 4) DAG Open Questions Closed (No New Tier-2 Items)
C-003 (Decision atom format for own decisions):
Decision atoms are canonical markdown blocks with fields: `decision_id`, `context`, `claim`, `evidence_refs`, `constraints`, `failure_modes`, `reversal_condition`, `commit_artifact`. Store in `agents/commander/outbox/` and link to canon target file. This answers format and feedback loop requirement.

C-004 (Triangulation trigger criteria):
Use five triggers with explicit thresholds:
1. Novelty > 0.6 or no precedent in Rosetta/canon: triangulate.
2. Blast radius includes structural, security, or canon mutation: triangulate.
3. Irreversibility high (rename, delete, migration): triangulate.
4. Low uncertainty and local reversible action: Commander+Adjudicator only.
5. Mechanical transformations with clear contracts: Commander solo.

C-008 (Sources antifragility):
Adopt bounded ingestion and decay:
1. Cap sovereign_review queue per cycle.
2. Enforce pending->queued->consumed->promoted/rejected lifecycle.
3. Add TTL/archive lane for stale unresolved atoms.
4. Feed quality failures back into triage scoring.
5. Require every batch to produce either promotion or explicit rejection with reason.

C-009 (Sovereign bandwidth; standing item):
Must be answered by direct Sovereign conversation (no triangulation). Required four numbers:
1. `hours_per_day`
2. `sessions_per_week`
3. `max_open_decisions`
4. `max_triangulations_per_week`
Until these are set, queue depth and cadence remain provisional.

C-010 (-INBOX processing):
Process by indexed, evidence-first triage:
1. Start with final synthesis files in each set.
2. Extract decision atoms into one session digest.
3. Promote only atoms linked to active intentions or explicit deferred commitments.
4. Archive scratchpad duplicates after extraction.

C-012 (Minimum viable memory):
For 30-day horizon, keep only:
1. File-based memory in repo.
2. Deferred commitments register.
3. Intention compass.
4. Session handoff/outbox receipts.
5. Optional graph projection only as read-optimized derivative.
Anything else is frozen until C-009 bandwidth confirms capacity.

C-013 (Transformation verification):
Use three hard metrics per batch:
1. `atoms_in` (queued inputs)
2. `axioms_out` (sovereign rewrites)
3. `canon_delta` (new or updated canonical artifacts)
Batch fails if `canon_delta=0` and no justified rejection ledger exists.

### 5) Zero-Content-Transformation Gap: 5-Atom Crystallization Protocol
Protocol name: Objective-Locked Five-Atom Crystallization (OL-5)

Stage 0. Objective Lock
1. Confirm explicit objective for this batch.
2. Bind target intention IDs.

Stage 1. Queue Build
1. Build queue capped at 5 atoms from eligible bands.
2. Freeze queue snapshot.

Stage 2. Ontology Gate
1. For each atom, confirm entity type and intention alignment.
2. Reject any atom lacking typed fit.

Stage 3. Sovereign Rewrite
1. Rewrite 5 atoms into 5 axioms using required protease format.
2. Each axiom must cite source atom IDs and preservation reason.

Stage 4. Promotion
1. Promote to praxis (`promoted_praxis`).
2. Promote to canon (`promoted_canon`).

Stage 5. Verification
1. Run integration gate.
2. Confirm artifact in `canon/01-CANON/sn/`.
3. Dispatch via ingest loop and log session evidence.

Termination condition:
`5 queued -> 5 consumed/promoted -> >=1 canon artifact commit`.

### 6) Local Corruption Recovery (Exact Self-Heal Pattern)
Required proof sequence:
1. `git checkout 1eb3d680` as restoration anchor (or targeted file checkout from that commit).
2. `make configs` to regenerate platform configs from AGENTS source.
3. Apply source-only banner edit in `AGENTS.md`.
4. Re-run `make configs` to propagate.
5. Verify only source+generated targets changed.

Rationale:
1. Commit `1eb3d680` explicitly captured AGENTS propagation and regenerated CLAUDE/GEMINI.
2. Makefile confirms AGENTS is source-of-truth for generated configs.
3. Council-22 recovery docs confirm this restoration mode is canonical practice.

### 7) Tightening Plan by Directory (All Paths Terminate at Canon)
`orchestration/`
1. Keep `orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/` as canonical operational layer.
2. Treat `orchestration/state/` as vestigial telemetry unless explicitly promoted.
3. Require every orchestration script to emit artifacts that either update praxis/canon or outbox receipts.

`engine/`
1. Keep question DAG as controlling instrument.
2. Convert open-question outputs into decision atoms with canon-target references.
3. Forbid new Tier-2 items unless DAG placement is explicit.

`praxis/`
1. Use `praxis/05-SIGMA/practice/PRAC-PROTEASE_AXIOMS.sn.md` as staging tier.
2. Only promote praxis entries with evidence and matched intentions.

`sources/`
1. Enforce queue cap and lifecycle transitions.
2. Add TTL/decay and rejection ledger discipline.
3. Promote only ontology-classified atoms.

`agents/`
1. Normalize flow:
`agents/*/inbox/pending -> active -> done/failed` for execution lifecycle.
2. Preserve Commander relay corpus in `-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/` as triangulation evidence vault.
3. Preserve `-SOVEREIGN/` as decision queue for approvals and bypass notes.
4. OpenClaw harmonization stays on current parked intention/deferred pathway; execute via existing intentions (`INT-2401` family) and not ad-hoc restructuring.

### 8) Discrepancy Register (Must Be Reconciled)
1. CC30 prompt claims `150 clusters` and `606 sovereign_review`; live files show `50 clusters` and queue band `120`.
2. CC30 prompt references `37 triangulation responses`; live index reports `32`.

Action:
Before next DAG cycle, regenerate one machine-verified metrics snapshot and reference only that snapshot in prompts.
