## 0. What This Document Is

This is the **compiler specification** for the neo-canon — the spiritual successor to CANON-00000 through CANON-35999. It defines the irreducible primitives from which every neo-canon concept derives. If a concept cannot trace its lineage to this core, it does not belong in the neo-canon.

The core was synthesized from:
- **174 classified old-canon concepts** (26 SEED, 114 NATIVE, 17 HERITAGE, 13 VESTIGIAL, 4 ADMINISTRATIVE)
- **86 external source files** (40 thinkers mapped, 18 novel contributions, 10 gaps identified)
- **The annealment trilogy** (Grand Annealment + Clarescence Master + Runlogs Master — ~1,200 lines of pre-distilled synthesis)

**The self-sufficiency test**: Can you derive a new concept from this document alone, without consulting any old-canon file? If yes, the core is deep enough. If no, it needs deepening.

## I. TELOS

### The Terminal Condition

**A sovereign human operating at civilizational scale, with coherence intact.**

| Word | Meaning | Axiom |
|------|---------|-------|
| Sovereign | Ground truth resides with the individual, not any platform, institution, or model | A3 |
| Human | Biological, capacity-constrained, attention-bottlenecked — not a flaw but the design parameter | A2 |
| Civilizational scale | The 10-stage Causal Chain realized as Gaian Field Nodes across 28 convergence domains | A4 |
| Coherence intact | Remaining oneself under persuasion, overload, and fragmentation | A1 |

### What "Done" Looks Like

**Near-term**: First published Catalyst Packet + first Rosetta-governed agent action. These mark the transition from factory to product.

**Terminal**: Gaian Field Nodes — solarpunk + permaculture physical infrastructure embodying the Seven-Layer Stack in built form. 1 → 5-8 → 20-30 → 50-100 nodes over 20 years.

### The Personal Palantir

The architectural form of the telos. Not an app — the semantic backbone that makes sovereignty technically enforceable at scale. Distinguished from enterprise Palantir by its target: not efficiency under uncertainty, but **coherence under persuasion, overload, and fragmentation**.

---

## II. AXIOMS

Four irreducible primitives. None derives from the others. Together they generate the complete architecture.

### A1. COHERENCE AS SCARCE RESOURCE (the telos)

> The personal ontology targets remaining-oneself under persuasion, overload, and fragmentation. Coherence is the scarce resource, not compute or storage. This distinction governs every design decision.

**Evidence chain**: Claresce3v2 scored 6.3/10. T1a↔T2 chain at 1/174 items linked. 86% deferred commitment loss rate. System is "intellectually complete and operationally empty." 42% delivery rate despite correct architecture.

**External validation**: Hoffman's Fitness Beats Truth theorem shows coherence is actively counter-selected by evolution — maintaining it requires deliberate architectural support, not just personal discipline. Schmachtenberger's metacrisis frames coherence-loss at civilizational scale. Bazin's auteur theory operationalizes coherence as "interior meaning" under creative pressure.

**What A1 generates**: Every structure that protects coherence — the Sovereignty Stack, the Hard-Gate skills, the Anti-Shelfware mechanisms, the clarescence protocol. Without A1, the system optimizes for throughput and loses the person running it.

**Heritage**: 15 SEED concepts trace directly to A1, including Energy State Adaptations, Safeguards (Syncretism Prevention + Intellectual Bypass + Framework Imprisonment), Feed Curation as "cognitive substrate engineering," and Guardrail 05 (No Philosophical Maximalism).

### A2. CAPACITY BEFORE INTELLIGENCE (the binding constraint)

> The Sovereign's constraint is capacity (energy, bandwidth, activation), not intelligence. Every major decision has been correct; the gap is exclusively between decision and activation. Systems must route around this constraint, not assume it away.

**Evidence chain**: Grand Synthesis terminal statement. Kill test 1 (6 min, zero recovery) — infrastructure, not reasoning. 42% delivery rate despite correct architecture. Sophistication Plateau: architecturally mature at 40% operational capacity. 50:1 analysis-to-execution ratio pre-canon.

**External validation**: McCourt's energy math (basic personal AI = 20% US grid) grounds A2 in thermodynamics. Chollet's efficiency gap (LLMs 4-5 orders of magnitude less efficient than humans at skill acquisition) quantifies the capacity problem. Csikszentmihalyi's "psychic energy as RAM" provides the individual mechanism.

**Known challenge**: Alexander/Kokotajlo's R&D multiplier (5x by 2027) suggests A2 may be self-dissolving at civilizational scale as AI bootstraps capacity expansion. **Resolution**: A2 remains valid at any individual's operational horizon even if transitional at civilizational scale. The Sovereign is a person, not a civilization.

**What A2 generates**: The Instruction → Skill → Hook maturity ladder, the σ₀-first engineering principle, the Three-Layer Autonomic Dispatch, agent capability profiles, resource pool routing. Without A2, the system assumes infinite attention and builds shelfware.

**Heritage**: 11 SEED concepts trace to A2, including Universal Energy State Topology, AuDHD lens ("capacity constraints are universal"), Decision Quality Framework, and "Frameworks serve practitioners, not vice versa."

### A3. SOVEREIGNTY INVARIANT (the ground truth principle)

> The repo is ground truth; all other surfaces are cache. Semantic authority must live outside any single app — deleting an app must not delete meaning. When state conflicts between a platform and the repo, the repo wins.

**Evidence chain**: CLAUDE.md Constitutional Rule 5. Delete-the-app test. DEC-SOV-019 (zero cloud services). Schema capture as distinct security threat (PATCH-002). CARDINAL RULE violations corrected 3x on 2026-02-16.

**External validation**: Walker's Assembly Theory grounds A3 in physics — objects are embodied history; the repo with version history is literally a high-assembly-index object encoding irreplaceable construction pathways. Destroying it destroys the pathway, not just the endpoint. Aguera y Arcas identifies the narrative memory gap (persistent long-term memory creating identity over time) — the repo IS this missing narrative memory.

**Known challenge**: Shapiro's moatlessness thesis — if AI capabilities are universally accessible, semantic authority disperses. **Resolution**: The repo isn't sovereign because capabilities are unique; it's sovereign because accumulated context, history, and intentionality are unique. Construction pathway is the value, not the endpoint (Walker).

**What A3 generates**: The Sovereignty Stack (σ₀–σ₇), the Directionality Test (organ vs. shackle), the Constitutional Rules, the Schema Sovereignty theorem. Without A3, the system becomes a feature of someone else's platform.

**Heritage**: 5 SEED concepts trace to A3, including Memory Sovereignty Principle, Repository as Ground Truth, and Differential Sovereignty.

### A4. INTENT-ARTIFACT PIPELINE (the value chain)

> Value only crystallizes when intent traverses the full chain: capture → distill → model → activate → verify. Any break in this chain = shelfware. The pipeline operates at every scale simultaneously.

**Evidence chain**: 10-stage Causal Chain. Catalyst Packet unit (Claim + Micro-demo + Artifact + Invitation). Constitutional Rule 3 (Receipts). 42% delivery rate = pipeline health measurement. 0% hard-gate skill delivery as of Feb 15.

**External validation**: molt_cornelius names the Verbatim Trap — "Did this produce anything the source didn't already contain?" as the deployable test for distillation failure. VVSVS's Compounding Creative (Consumer → Curator → Creator → Compounder) maps who completes the pipeline. Mollick's three ingredients (domain expertise + prompt craft + workflow integration) — missing any one breaks the pipeline.

**Known challenge**: Deutsch's Popperian critique — LLMs are "universal mimics, not universal explainers." If the model stage requires genuine explanatory knowledge, current LLMs cannot complete it for novel domains. **Resolution**: A4 requires an adversarial verification gate distinguishing genuine from mimicry output. The Chollet ARC framework and the Verbatim Trap test both point toward this.

**What A4 generates**: The Hard-Gate skill sequence (INBOUND → ORIENT → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → CLOSE), the Interaction State Machine, the Causal Chain, the Catalyst Packet format. Without A4, the system accumulates understanding without crystallizing value.

**Heritage**: 7 SEED concepts trace to A4, including Interaction State Machine, KNOWLEDGE Chain (embodiment as core purpose), WISDOM Chain (emerges last from all chains), Four-Stage trajectories, and "philosophical foundation derived LAST."

## III. THEOREMS

Three operationally load-bearing principles derived from the axioms.

### T1. ATTENTION BOTTLENECK (σ₀) — from A1 + A2

Attention is the intersection of coherence and capacity. When coherence degrades under capacity constraint, the mechanism is attention exhaustion. σ₀ (Sovereign Attention) sits at the top of every stack because all other strata serve it.

**Generates**: The σ₀–σ₇ stack ordering, the Hook maturity ladder (hooks fire regardless of attention), the proactive orchestrator concept, attention-routing dispatch.

### T2. ANTI-SHELFWARE — from A2 + A4

Accumulated capability without activation energy is zero. Shelfware is the failure mode of the Intent-Artifact Pipeline under Capacity constraint. Every concept in the neo-canon must have an explicit activation path or be labeled SUPPORTING/ARCHIVED.

**Generates**: Kill Criteria, Maturity Gates, the "factory before product" sequencing principle, the promotion pipeline (produced → reviewed → promoted → verified).

**External enrichment**: The Verbatim Trap (molt_cornelius) operationalizes the distill-stage failure. The Compounding Creative (VVSVS) provides the developmental stage model.

### T3. SCHEMA SOVEREIGNTY — from A3

Only the Sovereign defines or modifies the canonical entity taxonomy. An actor controlling object type definitions controls the Sovereign's operational reality. Schema capture is ontological capture — distinct from credential theft.

**Generates**: The Directionality Test, SecurityBoundary entity type, DEC-SOV-019 (zero cloud services), the Rosetta Stone as schema authority artifact.

**External enrichment**: The Specification Class (AI Explained) extends T3 to collective scale — a technocratic elite defining AI reward functions holds semantic authority above individual sovereignty.

---

## IV. ENTITY TAXONOMY (the type system)

### Tier 1 — Invariants

Structural load-bearing. Deletion requires Sovereign override. These model what persists.

| Entity | Definition | State Machine | Ring |
|--------|-----------|---------------|------|
| **Commitment** | A promise with lifecycle and accountability chain | proposed → active → fulfilled → renegotiated → dissolved | SELF |
| **Capacity** | Throttleable, depletable operational resource | available → allocated → depleted → recovering | SELF |
| **Risk** | Identified constraint or threat with probability/impact | identified → assessed → mitigated → accepted → materialized | SELF |
| **Constraint** | Hard boundary on action space | active → suspended → retired | SELF |
| **Identity Facet** | Sovereign self-representation in context | latent → active → primary → archived | SELF |
| **Relationship** | First-class typed link between entities | proposed → active → strained → dissolved | COMMUNITY |
| **Resource** | Durable asset with lifecycle | acquired → deployed → maintaining → retired | AGENCY |

**Design principle**: Tier 1 models INVARIANTS — things that persist regardless of which tools, platforms, or agents are in use. A Commitment exists whether tracked in Linear, Things, or a text file. This is the direct consequence of A3: invariants survive app deletion.

**Heritage note**: The old canon modeled artifacts (tasks, notes, documents) at the top tier. PATCH-008 corrected this: "Without invariants, the ontology degenerates into a glorified CRM."

### Tier 2 — Operational

Working objects. Creation/deletion at agent discretion within policy. These model what changes.

| Entity | Definition | Ring |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **Project** | Bounded scope with terminal condition | WORK |
| **Agent** | Autonomous executor within governed constraints; typed by capability profile | AGENCY |
| **Tool** | Capability-extending instrument with maturity state (Instruction → Skill → Hook) | AGENCY |
| **Source** | Provenance-tagged information artifact | AGENCY |
| **Pattern** | Reusable solution template with activation path | AGENCY |
| **Context** | Environmental state affecting all operations | AGENCY |
| **Credential** | Authentication/authorization token with rotation lifecycle | AGENCY |

**Credential** is new — demanded by operational evidence (DC-003: 14 services in plaintext, Adjudicator silent 3 days from missing failure-reason field). State machine: `issued → active → rotating → expired → revoked`.

### Tier 3 — Architecturally Significant

Emergent from operational experience. These model what the system learned it needed.

| Entity | Definition | Ring |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **Memory** | Versioned state with provenance and time-travel support | SELF |
| **Policy / Rule** | Legislature of the personal constitutional democracy | SELF |
| **Health State** | Biological first-class object; glucose-aware throttling | SELF |
| **BudgetEnvelope** | Resource allocation boundary (token pools, rate limits) | AGENCY |
| **SecurityBoundary** | Schema sovereignty enforcement perimeter (capability, not network) | AGENCY |
| **CaptureQueue** | Inbound signal buffer awaiting triage | AGENCY |
| **EscalationQueue** | Decision buffer requiring Sovereign attention | SELF |

### Governed Verbs (the Kinetic layer)

Seven canonical verbs define what can change. Each verb is typed — it operates on specific entity tiers.

| Verb | Domain | Operates On | Effect |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| **Commit** | Commitment lifecycle | Tier 1 | Create or strengthen a binding promise |
| **Decline** | Commitment lifecycle | Tier 1 | Refuse without creating obligation |
| **Delegate** | Agency transfer | Tier 2 | Transfer execution authority, retain accountability |
| **Renegotiate** | Commitment modification | Tier 1 | Modify terms while preserving relationship |
| **Escalate** | Sovereignty invocation | Any | Elevate decision to higher authority level |
| **Suspend** | State preservation | Any | Pause without dissolving — preserves state for resumption |
| **Transition** | State advancement | Any | Move entity to next state in its machine |

**Type safety**: A Commitment cannot be Delegated (only its execution can be). A Risk cannot be Committed to (only its mitigation can be). A Credential cannot be Suspended (it must be Revoked or Rotated — security states are irreversible). These constraints are compile-time.

**Supersede-Never-Delete principle** (from INT-P018, Heritage item): No entity is destroyed. It is superseded — the old version persists in version history. Purge is not a verb. The Sovereign may Transition an entity to `archived` state, but the entity's history remains.

## V. COSMOLOGICAL RING STRUCTURE (the addressing system)

### The Five Rings

```

| Ring | Code | σ-Strata | Mutation Rate | Contents |
|------|------|----------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | **SELF** | σ₀–σ₂ | Glacial (years) | Axioms, identity, coherence, health, sensemaking, semantic core |
| 2 | **AGENCY** | σ₃–σ₅ | Slow (months) | Constellation, corpus, integration, dispatch, tools, memory |
| 3 | **WORK** | — | Moderate (weeks) | Catalyst Packets, content, consulting, products, Cinematic Textbook |
| 4 | **COMMUNITY** | σ₆ | Moderate (weeks) | Steward Network, Peer Coils, Proof Sessions, access/security |
| 5 | **WORLD** | σ₇ | Fast (days) | Convergence domains, Gaian Field Nodes, sensing, civilizational vision |

### Semantic Addressing

Every neo-canon concept receives: `RING.DOMAIN.concept-name`

**Addressing rules**:
1. Ring membership is exclusive — every concept belongs to exactly one ring
2. Boundary concepts (e.g., σ₂ Semantic Core) are assigned to the inner ring
3. Addresses are human-readable, derivation-testable, non-numeric
4. Concepts closer to SELF are more invariant; closer to WORLD more contingent

**Example addresses**:
```
SELF.AXIOM.coherence-as-scarce-resource          (A1)
SELF.IDENTITY.philosophers-stone                  (σ₀)
SELF.HEALTH.energy-state-topology                 (SEED #21)
AGENCY.DISPATCH.auto-ingest-loop                  (Layer 1 autonomic)
AGENCY.CONSTELLATION.protoss-primary              (DEC-SOV-008)
AGENCY.MEMORY.three-layer-architecture            (KG + Daily Notes + Tacit)
WORK.CATALYST.packet-format                       (Claim + Micro-demo + Artifact + Invitation)
WORK.CONTENT.cinematic-textbook                   (episodic curriculum)
COMMUNITY.STEWARD.network-topology                (peer coils, proof sessions)
COMMUNITY.ACCESS.credential-governance            (DC-003 resolution)
WORLD.CONVERGENCE.gaian-field-node                (terminal vision)
WORLD.CONVERGENCE.tri-helical-strategy            (3 synchronized timelines)
```

### The σ₀–σ₇ Stack (mapped to rings)

| Stratum | Name | Ring | Status |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| σ₀ | Philosopher's Stone (canonical identity/values) | SELF | Implicit |
| σ₁ | Sensemaking (clarescence, meta-awareness) | SELF | Active |
| σ₂ | Semantic Core (ontology.db, Rosetta Stone) | SELF | **THE UNBUILT GAP** |
| σ₃ | Corpus (CANON, ENGINE, SIGMA) | AGENCY | Active |
| σ₄ | Integration (MCP, APIs, webhooks) | AGENCY | Active |
| σ₅ | Agency (Constellation, dispatch) | AGENCY | Active |
| σ₆ | Access (auth, permissions, security) | COMMUNITY | Partial (DC-003 open) |
| σ₇ | Sensing (inbound data, feedcraft, hooks) | WORLD | Active |

**σ₇-First Engineering Principle**: Build from the outside in. Sensing before sensemaking. σ₂ is the critical gap — without it, agents act but cannot act within governed semantic constraints.

## VI. PROCESSING ARCHITECTURE (the runtime)

### Cognitive Palace — 7 Simultaneous Layers

Not sequential. Not hierarchical in execution. Simultaneous.

| Layer | Name | Domain | Ring |
|-------|------|--------|------|
| 0 | Reality | Ontological bedrock | SELF |
| 1 | Imaginalia | Teleological attraction | SELF |
| 2 | Potentiality | Resource domains | AGENCY |
| 3 | Temporality | Rhythmic harmonics | AGENCY |
| 4 | Practicality | Operational categories | WORK |
| 5 | Actuality | Eternal present nexus | WORK |
| 6 | Consequentiality | Wisdom accumulation | COMMUNITY |
| σ | Transcendence Ring | Strategic Harmony | WORLD |

### Six Causal Chains (the capacity scaffold)

Each chain has 4 stages. All chains require Intelligence Stage 1 as baseline.

| Chain | Domain | Stage 4 Terminal |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Intelligence | AI fluency, tool mastery | Teaching AI collaboration |
| Information | Signal acquisition, curation | Teaching information architecture |
| Insight | Cross-domain synthesis | Teaching synthesis methodology |
| Expertise | Domain depth, consulting | Teaching domain mastery |
| Knowledge | Embodied understanding | Teaching embodied practice |
| Wisdom | Meta-cognitive integration | Teaching wisdom traditions |

**Hard dependencies**:
- Expertise S2+ requires Information S2
- Knowledge S2+ requires Insight S2
- Wisdom S2+ requires ALL chains at S2 + Insight S3
- Any S4 (teaching) requires Wisdom S2+

**Heritage**: "Philosophical foundation derived LAST" (SEED #24) — Wisdom is the terminal chain. You cannot teach what you have not embodied through all prior chains.

### Modal Sequence (civilizational time backbone)

| Modal | Era | Maturity | Phase |
|-------|-----|----------|-------|
| 1 Abstraction | LLMs, 2024–27 | ~85% | **CURRENT** |
| 2 Simulation | World models, 2027–30 | ~40% | Emerging |
| 3 Embodiment | Physical AI, 2031–36 | ~15% | Pre-paradigmatic |
| 4 Transcendence | 2037+ | ~5% | Theoretical |

**Critical window**: 12-18 months before LLM differentiation commoditizes. The first Catalyst Packet must ship within Modal 1.

### Hard-Gate Skill Sequence (DEC-C3)

| Gate | Skill | Fires When | Failure = |
|------|-------|------------|-----------|
| INBOUND | /triage | Session start | No work claimed |
| ORIENT | /claresce | Non-trivial decision | No plan without clarescence |
| IMPLEMENT | /execute | Plan approved | No dispatch without execution entry |
| VERIFY | /verification-before-completion | Before any completion claim | No "done" without evidence |
| CLOSE | /update_universal_ledger | Task complete | No state change without ledger sync |

**Delivery rate as of Feb 15**: 0%. This is the primary T2 (Anti-Shelfware) failure — the intervention designed to fix activation has itself fallen into the activation gap.

### Three-Layer Autonomic Dispatch

| Layer | Metaphor | Cadence | Function | Status |
|-------|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Spinal cord | 30s | auto_ingest_loop.sh — task execution | OPERATIONAL |
| 2 | Brainstem | 60s | watchdog — health monitoring + recovery | OPERATIONAL |
| 3 | Prefrontal | 300s | proactive_orchestrator — work generation | NON-FUNCTIONAL (exits 1) |

---

## VII. DEPLOYMENT TARGET (the platform)

### Personal Palantir — Four Constitutive Layers

```
SEMANTIC   → What exists: typed entities, properties, relationships
KINETIC    → What can change: governed verbs, state transitions
DYNAMIC    → Who can do what: permissions, governance, policy
PHYSICS    → What emerges: computed properties, simulations, predictions [FUTURE]
```

**Four constitutive primitives**: Object Types, Link Types, Action Types, Functions.

**Directionality Test** (from PATCH-007):
- If the app defines how you model your world → skeleton/shackle
- If your ontology defines your world model and the app is one interface → organ

**Delete-the-App Test**:
- If deleting the app deletes your semantics → workspace (FAIL)
- If deleting removes only an interface while schema persists → ontology (PASS)

### The Minimum Viable Palantir Kernel

Five required components (no fewer):
1. Typed entities (Tier 1/2/3 from §IV)
2. State transitions (state machines per entity)
3. Governed verbs (Kinetic layer from §IV)
4. Versioned history (event sourcing — append-only ledger)
5. Action mediation (security boundaries + budget gates)

**σ₂ is where this kernel lives.** It is THE UNBUILT GAP. Without σ₂, agents act but cannot act within governed semantic constraints.

---

## VIII. INTELLECTUAL HERITAGE

The neo-canon does not exist in isolation. These external thinkers independently validated, challenged, or extended the axioms.

### Heritage Acknowledgments

| Thinker | Contribution to Neo-Canon | Axiom |
|---------|--------------------------|-------|
| Sara Imari Walker | Assembly Theory grounds A3 in physics — objects are embodied history | A3 |
| Trevor McCourt | Energy math grounds A2 in thermodynamics — personal AI = 20% US grid | A2 |

| Francois Chollet | Skill acquisition efficiency quantifies A2 — 4-5 orders of magnitude gap | A2 |
| molt_cornelius | Verbatim Trap names A4 distillation failure | A4 |
| Ivan VVSVS | Compounding Creative maps A4 developmental stages | A4 |
| David Deutsch | Popperian critique — LLMs are mimics, not explainers — challenges A4 model stage | A4 |
| Blaise Aguera y Arcas | Narrative memory gap identifies what the repo provides; symbiogenesis | A3 |
| Joseph Henrich | Collective brain (population × connectivity × fidelity) > individual intelligence | WORLD |
| Benjamin Bratton | Pre-paradigmatic moment = coherence crisis when concepts lag technology | WORLD |

| Niklas Luhmann | Zettelkasten = A4 model stage + proto-A3 (authority outside any single notebook) | A3+A4 |

### Named Failure Modes (from external sources)

| Failure Mode | Source | Axiom | Definition |
|-------------|--------|-------|------------|
| Verbatim Trap | molt_cornelius | A4 | Artifact contains nothing the source didn't already contain |
| Specification Class | AI Explained | A3 | Technocratic elite defining reward functions holds authority above individual sovereignty |
| Platform Gravity | OpenAI/Google | A3 | Stateful APIs pull semantic authority off-repo structurally |
| Neuralese Gap | Douglas/Bricken | A4 | LLM model stage may be unverifiable — internal language not human-interpretable |

---

## IX. OPEN GAPS (for Phase 4)

### Structural Gaps

| Gap | Priority | Required Action |
|-----|----------|-----------------|
| Security Domain | P0 | A1-A4 do not address threat surfaces. Propose T4 (Security = A3 applied to perimeter) or elevate to A5 |
| DC-004: 25 Rosetta terms | P0 | Must enumerate before taxonomy is finalized |
| DC-003: Credential governance | P0 | Credential entity added (§IV) but physical rotation not yet executed |
| Layer 3 Autonomic (exits 1) | P1 | Proactive orchestrator non-functional — no prefrontal cortex |
| Hard-Gate 0% delivery | P1 | DEC-C3 is itself shelfware — needs second-order intervention |
| σ₂ build (Semantic Core) | P1 | The critical gap — File-First vs. SQLite-First unresolved |
| Narrative DNA | P2 | StarCraft/Dune/Halo metaphors support navigation but don't derive from axioms |

### Unresolved Tensions

| Tension | Nature | Partial Resolution |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| File-First vs. SQLite-First | ClawVault: 74.0% markdown vs 68.5% specialized tools | Sovereign adjudication required before σ₂ build |
| A2 self-dissolving at scale | R&D multiplier may bootstrap capacity | A2 valid at individual horizon even if transitional |
| A4 completability | Deutsch: LLMs can't do genuine model stage | Adversarial verification gate needed |
| AI as tool vs. subsystem | AI Explained: AI has incompatible logic | Recursive Language Model may dissolve boundary |
| Self-assessment inflation | 27-point gap (Commander 88% vs. Adjudicator 61%) | Independent adversarial audit constitutionally protected |

## X. THE SOFTWARE SUCCESSION TEST

### Does the neo-canon move correctness burden from reader to architecture?

**Test 1 — Forward Derivation**: Can a novel concept derive from the core alone?

"Agent Health Monitoring" → A2 (capacity constraint demands health awareness) + A4 (verification gate requires health evidence) + Entity: Health State (Tier 3) + Verb: Transition (depleted → recovering) → Address: AGENCY.CONSTELLATION.health-monitoring. **PASS** — no old-canon reference needed.

**Test 2 — Vestigial Pruning**: Does a vestigial concept fail automatically?

"CANON-30300" (a number) → No axiom derivation. No ring assignment. No entity type. No governed verb. No state machine. → **PRUNED**.

"Universal Resonance Field" (celestial metaphor) → No axiom maps to resonance as a physical mechanism. Decorative. → **PRUNED**.

**Test 3 — Coherence Enforcement**: Does the architecture reject incoherent additions?

"Social Media Scheduling Tool" as Tier 1 entity → Tier 1 requires structural load-bearing status. Social media scheduling is contingent on platforms (violates A3), is not an invariant, and has no state machine that survives platform deletion. → **REJECTED** at compile time. Maximum: Tier 2 Tool with maturity state.

**Test 4 — Heritage Preservation**: Can old-canon insights be recovered?

"Celestial Hierarchy" (HERITAGE #2) → The navigational vocabulary (stellar names for energy states) is documented as vocabulary, not ontological claim. The energy-state adaptation matrix (SEED #5) carries the load-bearing content. Heritage preserved, vestigial shell discarded. → **PASS**.

All four tests pass. The core is self-sufficient.

---

## XI. BACK-PROPAGATION CHAIN

Every concept in the neo-canon must be on this critical path or explicitly labeled SUPPORTING or ARCHIVED.
