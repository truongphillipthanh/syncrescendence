## PASS 0: Orient & Situate

### Ground Truth
- Machine: M1-Mac-mini.local
- Working tree: 5 modified files (state files), 1 untracked (mba-cascade-install.sh)
- Last commit: `c2c7955` sync(ajna) — MBA inbox sync
- Commander inbox: empty (all processed)
- Prior clarescence: 2 directly relevant (truth-surfaces-substrate 2026-02-04, task-arch-ontology-linear 2026-02-05)

### Source Corpus
Two rounds of Palantir Ontology metacharacterization using the Medley pattern (4 web avatars: ChatGPT/Vanguard, Claude/Vizier, Gemini/Diviner, Grok/Oracle):

| Round | Prompt Focus | Files | Total ~KB |
|-------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Palantir Ontology deep dive → Functional essences → Complex hypothetical → Post-singularity reimagination | 4 × (21-41KB) | ~114KB |
| 2 | Closest software analogues → Prosumer implementation → Apps as shackles vs organs | 4 × (17-27KB) | ~83KB |

### Tier
**T0+T1a** (Strategic + Repo-Operational). This clarescence affects the foundational architecture of INT-MI19, the declared FINAL BOSS of Syncrescendence. It touches substrate decisions that survive multiple modal transitions.

### Dependencies
- **Blocks**: PROJ-006a completion (ontology content), PROJ-006b advancement (ontology substrate), IMPL-F-0006 (Palantir impedance mapping), every future ontology-related task
- **Blocked by**: Nothing. All inputs are available. The metacharacterization IS the input.

### Affected Agents
- **All 6**: This is a system-level architectural decision. Sovereign (defines entity types), Commander (implements kernel), Adjudicator (validates schema), Cartographer (maps corpus), Psyche (system cohesion), Ajna (strategic alignment).

### Multi-Agent Dispatch
- Adjudicator: TASK-20260211 — Logical contradiction audit, gap analysis, actionability grading
- Cartographer: TASK-20260211 — Corpus survey, entity-relationship formal model, impedance mapping

## PASS 1: Triumvirate Calibration

### Destination
INT-MI19: "Palantir-like ontology — the FINAL BOSS." The metacharacterization is the most comprehensive analysis we've ever conducted of this intention. Four frontier AI models, two progressive rounds, total convergence on the architectural pattern.

### Current State (verified)
- **ARCH-ROSETTA_ONTOLOGY_BRIDGE.md** (v1.0): 200+ relations, 10 entity types (CON, CAP, TOOL, AGT, WF, ART, PROTO, NOT, MET, STR), 79 CANON files cross-referenced
- **REF-ONTOLOGY_REGISTRY.md** (v0.1): Proposal stage. 9 entity types, YAML schema, relation primitives defined but not enforced
- **ontology.db**: 939 rows, 21 tables, 89 SQL functions, `ontology_query.py` CLI operational (10 commands). Completed 2026-02-10.
- **Obsidian vault**: 79 CANON files with structured frontmatter. Dataview queries planned but not built.
- **Five-Tier Architecture**: Fully operational (T0=Intentions, T1a=Linear, T1b=ClickUp, T2=IMPL-MAP, T3=Session)
- **12 MCP servers**: Linear, ClickUp, Graphiti, Obsidian, Filesystem, Chrome DevTools, Playwright, Qdrant, Gemini, Jira, Todoist, Airtable
- **Knowledge graphs**: Neo4j+Graphiti (dynamic KG), Qdrant (vector search), Chroma (embeddings)

### Fit Verdict: **CONVERGENT — META-VALIDATING**

The metacharacterization doesn't reveal we need to *start* building a personal ontology. It reveals we are **already 50% there** and need to:
1. Recognize what we've built as ontological infrastructure
2. Identify the 5 critical missing primitives
3. Wire the existing pieces into the unified kernel

This is the highest-fit clarescence in project history. Every model independently described architecture we already partially have.

## PASS 2: Lens Sweep (18)

| # | Lens | P/F | Note |
|---|------|-----|------|
| 1 | Sovereignty | **PASS** | "Build the kernel, rent the organs" = our entire philosophy. Repo sovereignty invariant already enforces this. |
| 2 | Portability | **PASS** | SQLite + Obsidian + Git = maximally portable. No vendor lock-in on the kernel. |
| 3 | Durability | **PASS** | ontology.db + CANON frontmatter + ARCH-ROSETTA_ONTOLOGY_BRIDGE survive session boundaries. |
| 4 | Reversibility | **PASS** | Git versioning on all schema definitions. SQLite is file-based, trivially restorable. |
| 5 | Atomicity | **WARN** | Multiple parallel substrates (SQLite, Neo4j, Qdrant, Obsidian frontmatter) lack atomic cross-substrate transactions. Need reconciliation protocol. |
| 6 | Verifiability | **PASS** | ontology_query.py provides 10 verification commands. CANON frontmatter grep-verifiable. 0 FK violations in ontology.db. |
| 7 | Delegability | **PASS** | Entity type definitions are delegable. Adjudicator can validate schema, Cartographer can survey corpus. Dispatches sent. |
| 8 | Composability | **PASS** | 10 entity types compose cleanly. Relation primitives (10 types) are orthogonal. |
| 9 | Observability | **PASS** | DYN-GLOBAL_LEDGER logs all state transitions. ontology_query.py stats command provides real-time health. |
| 10 | Token economy | **WARN** | The metacharacterization consumed ~200KB of frontier model output. This is expensive but one-time. Ongoing ontology operations must be token-efficient. |
| 11 | Energy sustainability | **PASS** | Ontology kernel is code, not conversation. Once built, it runs without token expenditure. |
| 12 | Coupling risk | **WARN** | Multiple truth surfaces for entity definitions (Obsidian frontmatter, SQLite tables, ARCH-ROSETTA bridge, Graphiti nodes). Need single authoritative source. |
| 13 | Semantic clarity | **PASS** | 209 terms defined in REF-ROSETTA_STONE. 10 entity types in ONTOLOGY_BRIDGE. Terminology sweep completed (Chorus→Medley, Ring→σ). |
| 14 | Canon alignment | **PASS** | 79 CANON files already frontmattered. CANON-31150 is Platform Capability Catalog. Schema is CANON-00000. |
| 15 | Tier coherence | **PASS** | Ontology kernel strengthens T0↔T1a↔T2 coupling by making entity types queryable across tiers. |
| 16 | Agent compatibility | **PASS** | All 6 agents can interact with ontology through MCP servers (Obsidian, Filesystem, Graphiti). |
| 17 | Automation potential | **PASS** | INT-1612 (Begin ALL automations) directly served. ontology_query.py is automatable. Dataview queries are declarative. |
| 18 | Narrative fit | **PASS** | "FINAL BOSS" = Palantir ontology. "Sovereign Nexus" from ChatGPT R1 = Syncrescendence. "Forward Deployed Self-Architecture" from Claude R1 = what we're literally doing. |

**Score: 15/18 PASS, 3 WARN — STRONG PASS**

WARN items require attention but don't block the path. See Decision Atoms DA-02, DA-03.

## PASS 3: CANON Coherence

### What CANON says about ontology
- **CANON-00000 SCHEMA**: Defines the cosmological hierarchy (cosmos > core > lattice > chain > planetary > lunar > satellite/comet/asteroid). This IS an ontology — of knowledge, not of operations.
- **CANON-31150**: Platform Capability Catalog — tool evaluations. Not the operational ontology kernel.
- **ARCH-ROSETTA_ONTOLOGY_BRIDGE v1.0**: 200+ relations across 10 entity types. The bridge between terminology and typed entities. Currently the most complete ontological artifact.
- **REF-ONTOLOGY_REGISTRY v0.1**: Proposal for YAML/JSON per-entity storage. Still at proposal stage.

### Where reality diverges from CANON
1. **Two ontology layers exist independently**: The CANON cosmological hierarchy (knowledge structure) and the Rosetta Bridge (operational entities) are not formally connected. The CANON hierarchy governs how knowledge is organized; the Bridge governs how the system operates. They need a junction.
2. **ontology.db is infrastructure without semantics**: 939 rows model the system's functions, models, and API costs. But it doesn't model the operational entity types (Commitment, Project, Relationship) that the metacharacterization identifies as essential for a personal Palantir.
3. **No state machine formalization**: Entity types have maturity states (idea/draft/operational/deprecated) in the Registry proposal, but no explicit state transition rules or governed verbs. The metacharacterization unanimously identifies this as THE critical missing primitive.
4. **No action mediation layer**: All 4 models emphasize that the ontology must govern verbs (actions). Currently, actions happen through agents and scripts without passing through an ontological policy layer.

### Action
- Flag for CANON update: Need a new CANON document defining the "Personal Ontology Kernel" — the operational entity types, state machines, and governed verbs. This is distinct from the knowledge-organizing CANON hierarchy.
- ARCH-ROSETTA_ONTOLOGY_BRIDGE needs v2.0 that adds state machines and verbs to entity classifications.
- REF-ONTOLOGY_REGISTRY needs promotion from proposal to operational schema.

---

## PASS 4: Omni-Qualities

### Omniscience (knowing its own state)
**SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER**. The ontology kernel would make the system's state queryable across all domains. Currently, understanding system state requires reading multiple files (DYN-BACKLOG, IMPL-MAP, ledger, git status). An ontology with typed entities makes state a first-class query: "Show all Commitments in state 'active' that are blocked by a Resource in state 'depleted'."

### Omnipresence (reach across platforms)
**BETTER**. The "apps as organs" pattern extends reach. Currently, Linear knows about issues, ClickUp knows about tasks, Airtable knows about records — but none see across boundaries. The ontology kernel would be the cross-platform semantic layer that all MCP servers feed into.

### Omnipotence (autonomous action)
**CRITICAL GAP IDENTIFIED**. The metacharacterization reveals that the ontology must not only model entities but also govern VERBS — what actions are permitted, under what conditions, with what constraints. Currently, agents can execute any action their tools permit. The ontology kernel would add a policy layer: "Agent X can transition Entity Y from State A to State B only if Condition Z is met." This is the governance dimension that separates a database from an ontology.

### Omnibenevolence (alignment with Sovereign values)
**BETTER**. The ontology encodes the Sovereign's operational metaphysics — what entities matter, how they relate, what transitions are valid. This is the ultimate alignment mechanism: the ontology IS the Sovereign's value system made executable. As Claude R1 stated: "the hermeneutic circle of self-interpretation."

---

## PASS 5: Five Faces

### Sensing (σ₀–σ₁): Perception
**IMPROVED**. The ontology kernel makes all integrated apps into sensors. Currently, MCP servers provide read access to apps. With typed entity mapping, each app's data becomes structured perception: "Todoist task completed" → "Commitment #47 transitioned from active to fulfilled."

### Meaning (σ₂–σ₃): Interpretation
**DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED**. This is the ontology's core value. Raw data from 12 MCP servers has no unified meaning. The ontology provides the semantic layer that interprets "a new Jira ticket" as "a Commitment entered state proposed, owned by Agent X, blocking Project Y."

### Intention (σ₄): Alignment
**IMPROVED**. INT-MI19 has been the FINAL BOSS since Session 12+. The metacharacterization confirms this is the right direction and provides the architectural blueprint. The Five-Tier Architecture already models intentions (T0). The ontology formalizes how intentions relate to projects, commitments, and capabilities.

### Embodiment (σ₅–σ₆): Manifestation
**PARTIAL**. The ontology_query.py CLI is embodied. The MCP servers are embodied. The Obsidian frontmatter is embodied. What's NOT yet embodied: the state machine engine, the verb governance layer, the cross-substrate reconciliation protocol.

### Harmony (σ₇): Integration
**THE ENTIRE POINT**. The ontology IS σ₇ made operational. It is the layer that harmonizes all other layers. As Claude R2 stated: "The ontology becomes the place where 'meeting with Sarah' in your calendar connects to 'Sarah' in your relationship graph connects to 'Project X' in your project model connects to the invoice in your financial system."

---

## PASS 6: Rosetta Precision

### Term Audit (critical terms from metacharacterization)

| Metacharacterization Term | Rosetta Entry? | Action |
|--------------------------|----------------|--------|
| Object Type | No — implicit in entity types | Add explicit definition: "A typed entity class with properties, states, and governed transitions" |
| Action Type / Verb | No | **ADD**: "A governed operation that transitions an entity between states, subject to policy constraints" |
| State Machine | No | **ADD**: "A finite set of states and transitions that define an entity's lifecycle" |
| Governance Layer | Partial (Five Invariants = governance, but not ontological governance) | **ADD**: "Policy constraints determining which agents can execute which verbs under which conditions" |
| Semantic Layer | No (concept is distributed) | **ADD**: "The unified typed-entity abstraction that sits between raw data and applications/agents" |
| Integration Pipeline | No (closest: "Pipeline" in Neo-Blitzkrieg) | **ADD**: "Data flow from source apps through transformation into ontological entities" |
| Ontology Kernel | No | **ADD**: "The minimal sovereign semantic core: typed entities + state machines + governed verbs + versioned history" |
| Organ (app role) | No | **ADD**: "A prosumer app serving as a specialized interface to the ontology, replaceable without semantic loss" |
| Tributary (data role) | No | **ADD**: "A source system feeding data into the ontology; the app owns transactions, the ontology owns meaning" |

**9 Rosetta additions required**. This is significant — it means the metacharacterization introduced core terminology that our existing 209-term lexicon doesn't cover. The ontological domain needs its own Rosetta section.

---

## PASS 7: Backlog Coherence

### What this UNBLOCKS

| IMPL Entry | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| IMPL-F-0006 | **DIRECTLY ADDRESSED**: "SN ↔ Foundry Ontology mapping memo." The metacharacterization provides the Foundry ontology reference materials. Cartographer dispatched. |
| PROJ-006a (50%) | **ACCELERATES**: Frontmatter + Bridge v1.0 are foundations. This clarescence defines what Phase 2 looks like: state machines + governed verbs. |
| PROJ-006b (20%) | **REDEFINES**: The SQLite pilot was a substrate experiment. This clarescence provides the architectural blueprint for what the substrate SHOULD be. The 21 tables need redesign to include state machines and verb governance. |
| SYN-22 | **STATUS CHANGE**: "Foundry ontology reference materials" — now available via metacharacterization. Can move to In Progress. |
| SYN-24 | **INFORMED**: "Ontology enrichment" — now has a clear definition of what "enrichment" means (add state machines + verbs + governance). |
| SYN-39 | **INFORMED**: "Personal ontology kernel" — if it exists, this clarescence defines it. |

### What this CREATES

| New Task | Description | Tier |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Define Personal Entity Types | Sovereign must define: what are MY operational entity types? (Commitment, Project, Relationship, Asset, Capability, Goal, Risk, Idea, Agent...) | T0 (Sovereign) |
| State Machine Formalization | For each entity type, define states + transitions + governed verbs | T1a |
| Ontology Kernel Implementation | Build the minimal code that enforces typed entities, state machines, and verb governance | T1a |
| Cross-Substrate Reconciliation | Protocol for keeping SQLite, Neo4j, Obsidian, and Qdrant consistent | T1a |
| Rosetta v2.4.0 | Add 9 ontological terms from this clarescence | T2 |
| ARCH-ROSETTA_ONTOLOGY_BRIDGE v2.0 | Add state machines and verbs to entity classifications | T2 |

### Net Impact on T1a↔T2 Coupling
**Positive**: This clarescence adds 6 concrete tasks that bridge T1a decisions to T2 implementation. Coverage increases from 197/197 to 197+6/203.

---

## PASS 8: nth-Order Effects

### First Order (Direct)
- We now have a comprehensive architectural blueprint for the personal ontology kernel
- 4 frontier models independently validated our existing architecture
- 9 new Rosetta terms formalized
- 6 new tasks identified and prioritized
- Multi-agent dispatch activated (Adjudicator + Cartographer)

### Second Order (Cascade)
- **HighCommand connection** (INT-C006): The metacharacterization describes exactly what HighCommand's GUI should visualize — typed entities with state transitions, relationships, and governed verbs. HighCommand IS the "personal Workshop/Foundry" app layer.
- **n8n deployment** (planned): Moves from "nice to have" to "critical infrastructure." n8n is THE integration pipeline layer that makes apps into tributaries. Every model identified this.
- **Airtable role shift**: The 442 seeded records (SYN-55) are no longer "data storage" — they're an organ feeding into the ontology. The bidirectional sync (IMPL entry) becomes an integration pipeline task.
- **Agent capability expansion**: If agents ARE entities in the ontology with governed verbs, then agent dispatch itself becomes an ontological operation. This changes how we think about COCKPIT.md's role assignments.

### Third Order (Emergent)
- **The Ontology as Product**: If Syncrescendence successfully builds the "product that doesn't exist yet" (Claude R2's phrase), it becomes not just a personal system but a demonstrable architectural pattern. INT-MI19 stops being a personal project and becomes a proof-of-concept for the sovereign individual paradigm.
- **Modal 2 acceleration**: The ontology kernel is substrate-agnostic by design. When Modal 2 (2027) deploys web infrastructure, the kernel transfers directly. This is the "portability" that all 4 models emphasized.
- **Constellation recursion**: The ontology models the constellation, and the constellation operates on the ontology. This recursive loop is the "Reflexive Intelligence Layer" Claude R1 identified — and it's the mechanism by which the system becomes genuinely self-improving.

### Compounding Effects
- **Positive synergy** with recent CLARESCE^3 v2, credential rotation, MCP batch deployment. The infrastructure is ready; the ontology kernel is the capstone that makes it intelligent.
- **No interference** detected with current sprint work (SYN-51 Jira, SYN-53 Todoist). Those are organ onboarding — they feed INTO the ontology.

---

## PASS 9: Energy State

### Token Cost
- This clarescence session: ~300K tokens (reading 200KB corpus + orientation + 10 passes + artifact generation)
- Background analysis agent: ~50K tokens
- Dispatched agent tasks (when executed): ~100K tokens each
- **Total investment**: ~550K tokens for this strategic decision

### Sustainability Assessment
**SUSTAINABLE**. This is a one-time strategic investment that produces:
1. A durable architectural blueprint (this document)
2. Concrete implementation tasks (6 new)
3. Rosetta expansion (9 terms)
4. Multi-agent alignment (3 agents engaged)
5. IMPL-MAP updates
6. Ledger entries

The ontology kernel itself, once built, is code — it runs without token expenditure. The modeling decisions are the expensive part, and this clarescence IS the modeling decision.

### Staging
No staging needed. All 10 passes converge. The path is clear.

---

## PASS 10: Authenticity Gate

### Preserves sovereignty and optionality?
**YES**. "Build the kernel, rent the organs" = maximum sovereignty. The ontology kernel lives in the repo (Invariant 5: Repo Sovereignty). Every app is replaceable. Every substrate is swappable. The irreducible core is the Sovereign's typed entity definitions — and those are literally their worldview made explicit.

### Aligns with what the Sovereign actually values?
**YES**. INT-MI19 has been the declared FINAL BOSS since Session 12+. The Sovereign has consistently driven toward this: the ontology work, the substrate experiments, the tool onboarding, the automation mandate. This clarescence doesn't redirect — it crystallizes.

### Would the Sovereign at peak clarity approve this?
**YES**. The metacharacterization was commissioned by the Sovereign specifically to reach this clarescence. The Sovereign's exact words: "this is the Ontological theatre we're now in. That is the gravity of this task, how to decisively win this effort."

### Is this optimization theater?
**NO**. This produces 7 Decision Atoms, 6 concrete tasks, 9 Rosetta terms, and an architectural blueprint. Every output is actionable. No pass produced only prose.

**AUTHENTICITY GATE: PASSED**

---

## CONVERGENT PATH

**Build a 4-layer Personal Ontology Kernel that unifies Syncrescendence's existing infrastructure into a sovereign semantic substrate, using the architectural blueprint validated by 4 frontier AI models across 200KB of metacharacterization.**

The kernel architecture:

```
Layer 4: AI AGENTS (Commander, Adjudicator, Cartographer, Psyche, Ajna)
         ↕ governed verbs, policy constraints
Layer 3: INTEGRATION PIPELINES (n8n + launchd + MCP servers)
         ↕ data transformation, event routing
Layer 2: SEMANTIC CORE (Typed entities + State machines + Governed verbs)
         ↕ unified schema, authoritative definitions
Layer 1: STORAGE SUBSTRATES (ontology.db + Neo4j/Graphiti + Qdrant + Obsidian)
         ↕ persistence, query, search
Layer 0: ORGAN APPS (Linear, ClickUp, Jira, Todoist, Airtable, Calendar, etc.)
         = tributaries feeding data; interfaces consuming views
```

---

## MULTI-MODEL TRIANGULATION SYNTHESIS

### Universal Convergence (All 4 Models Agree)

1. **Three-Part Fusion**: Semantic graph + Governance + Executable actions = the irreducible ontology.
2. **"Build the Kernel, Rent the Organs"**: Fabricate the semantic core yourself. Everything else is replaceable infrastructure.
3. **The Product That Doesn't Exist**: A personal semantic substrate unifying all apps. Syncrescendence IS building this product.
4. **Self-Hosted Architecture**: Graph DB + Relational DB + Integration Layer + Custom UI + AI agents.
5. **Ontological Modeling Is the Hard Part**: Defining entity types for your operational reality is epistemologically demanding work that no tool can do for you.
6. **Apps as Organs vs Skeletons**: Directionality test — does the app define your model (shackle) or does your ontology define the model (organ)?

### Model-Specific Unique Insights

| Model | Unique Contribution | Actionability for Syncrescendence |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| **ChatGPT** | "Model invariants, not artifacts" — most individuals fail because they model tasks/notes instead of commitments/capacities/constraints | **HIGH**: Directly informs entity type selection. Our current types (CON, CAP, TOOL, AGT, WF, ART, PROTO, NOT, MET, STR) are artifact-centric. Need to add invariant types: Commitment, Goal, Risk, Relationship. |
| **Claude** | 5-layer individual stack (Sensorium → Ontology of Self → Agency → Sovereignty → Reflexive Intelligence) + "The product that doesn't exist yet" | **HIGH**: Maps directly to our σ layers. The "product that doesn't exist" IS Syncrescendence. Bootstrap path (start with 3 entities, grow organically) is immediately actionable. |
| **Gemini** | Sanity.io headless CMS as ontology kernel pattern + Event Sourcing for state transitions + Apple Shortcuts as kinetic layer | **MEDIUM**: Event Sourcing pattern is powerful — record Events, derive current state by replay. Aligns with our ledger approach (DYN-GLOBAL_LEDGER is already event-sourced). Headless CMS pattern applicable to HighCommand. |
| **Grok** | HASH platform, Cognee memory engine, DataWalk, d.AP — divergent tool landscape + "ontology overlays as-built artifacts" | **MEDIUM**: HASH and Cognee merit evaluation. "Ontology overlays as-built" validates our approach of adding frontmatter to existing CANON files rather than rebuilding from scratch. |

### What ALL 4 Models Missed (Commander's Non-Obvious Insights)

1. **Syncrescendence IS Already This**: The metacharacterization meta-validates our architecture. We're not "deciding whether to build" — we're 50% there. The question is not "should we?" but "what's missing in what we already have?"

2. **The Agent-as-Entity Problem**: AI agents are first-class entities in the ontology, not just operators. Commander has capabilities, state transitions (idle/executing/blocked), governed verbs (can commit, can dispatch, cannot push without permission). The ontology must be REFLEXIVE — it models the agents that operate on it.

3. **Token Economics as Ontological Primitive**: None addressed that in a multi-model constellation, tokens ARE currency. INT-P014 declares "tokens are minerals and vespene gas." Token budgets, routing costs, context windows, rate limits — these are first-class Entity properties, not operational details.

4. **Temporal Ontology**: How do entities change over time? Palantir has Pipeline Builder. We have DYN- files. But no formal temporal model exists for entity evolution (when did this Commitment enter 'stalled'? How long has this Capability been 'degraded'?). The ledger provides events but not temporal queries.

5. **Clarescence as Ontological Act**: The 10-pass clarescence procedure IS ontological modeling. Each pass applies a different interpretive lens to the same decision space. The procedure itself is a meta-ontological tool. None of the models recognized that decision-making frameworks are themselves ontological primitives.

## DECISION ATOMS

### DA-01: Personal Ontology Kernel Architecture
**Decision**: Adopt the 4-layer kernel architecture (Storage → Semantic Core → Integration Pipelines → AI Agents) with organ apps as tributaries.
**Truth surface**: This clarescence document + subsequent ARCH-PERSONAL_ONTOLOGY_KERNEL.md
**Reversibility**: High — each layer is independently replaceable
**Falsifier**: If the integration cost of maintaining 4 layers exceeds the semantic value gained, collapse to 2 layers (storage + agents)

### DA-02: Single Authoritative Source for Entity Definitions
**Decision**: ontology.db (SQLite) is the authoritative source for entity type definitions, state machines, and verb governance. Obsidian frontmatter, Graphiti nodes, and Qdrant embeddings are derived views.
**Truth surface**: ontology.db schema + migration scripts
**Reversibility**: Medium — requires migration if substrate changes
**Falsifier**: If SQLite's query expressiveness proves insufficient for graph traversal queries, migrate authority to Neo4j/Graphiti

### DA-03: Cross-Substrate Reconciliation Protocol
**Decision**: Implement a reconciliation protocol that propagates entity changes from ontology.db to all derived surfaces (Obsidian frontmatter, Graphiti, Qdrant) via event-driven sync.
**Truth surface**: reconciliation script in orchestration/scripts/
**Reversibility**: High — sync can be disabled without data loss
**Falsifier**: If reconciliation latency causes agents to operate on stale data, switch to read-through caching

### DA-04: Expand Entity Types Beyond Artifacts
**Decision**: Add invariant-modeling entity types to the current 10: Commitment (CMT), Goal (GOAL), Risk (RISK), Relationship (REL), Resource (RES), Environment (ENV). These model operational invariants, not artifacts.
**Truth surface**: REF-ONTOLOGY_REGISTRY.md v1.0 (promoted from proposal)
**Reversibility**: High — types can be deprecated without breaking existing types
**Falsifier**: If the expanded type set creates more categorization overhead than semantic value, prune back to core 10

### DA-05: Governed Verbs as First-Class Ontological Primitive
**Decision**: Define explicit verbs with policy constraints: Commit, Decline, Delegate, Renegotiate, Escalate, Suspend, Publish, Fork, Transition. Each verb specifies: permitted agents, source state, target state, required conditions.
**Truth surface**: New table in ontology.db: `governed_verbs`
**Reversibility**: High — verbs are additive
**Falsifier**: If verb governance creates friction that slows execution without preventing errors, downgrade to advisory-only

### DA-06: Event Sourcing for State Transitions
**Decision**: Adopt event sourcing for entity state changes. DYN-GLOBAL_LEDGER.md already captures events; formalize this as the temporal backbone. Record events, derive current state by replay.
**Truth surface**: DYN-GLOBAL_LEDGER.md format + ontology.db `events` table
**Reversibility**: Medium — event log is append-only by design
**Falsifier**: If event replay becomes computationally expensive at scale (>10K events), add materialized state snapshots

### DA-07: Agents as Ontological Entities
**Decision**: Model AI agents (Commander, Adjudicator, Cartographer, Psyche, Ajna) as first-class entities in the ontology with type AGT, states (idle/executing/blocked/dormant), capabilities, governed verbs, and resource constraints (token budgets, rate limits).
**Truth surface**: ontology.db AGT records + COCKPIT.md role definitions
**Reversibility**: High — agent records are just entity instances
**Falsifier**: If agent state changes too rapidly for ontological tracking (sub-second), limit to session-level state snapshots

---

## IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Schema Hardening (This Sprint)
1. Promote REF-ONTOLOGY_REGISTRY from v0.1 proposal to v1.0 operational
2. Add 6 new entity types (CMT, GOAL, RISK, REL, RES, ENV)
3. Add `governed_verbs` table to ontology.db
4. Add `state_machines` table to ontology.db
5. Update ontology_query.py with state machine and verb queries
6. Add 9 Rosetta terms (Rosetta v2.4.0)
7. Update ARCH-ROSETTA_ONTOLOGY_BRIDGE to v2.0 (add states + verbs)

### Phase 2: Integration Pipeline (Next Sprint)
1. Deploy n8n (self-hosted, Mac mini)
2. Build sync pipelines: Linear → ontology.db, ClickUp → ontology.db, Airtable ↔ ontology.db
3. Build reconciliation: ontology.db → Obsidian frontmatter, ontology.db → Graphiti
4. Wire DYN-GLOBAL_LEDGER as event source

### Phase 3: AI Mediation (Following Sprint)
1. Agent verb governance: agents query ontology for permitted actions before executing
2. Cross-domain queries: "What Commitments are blocked by Risks in state 'active'?"
3. Temporal queries: "Show all state transitions for Project X in the last 7 days"
4. HighCommand integration: GUI surface for ontology visualization + action execution

### Sovereign Decisions Required
- **Entity type definitions**: What are YOUR operational entity types? The 6 proposed additions are a starting point. Only the Sovereign can decide if Commitment, Goal, Risk, Relationship, Resource, Environment are the right categories for their operational reality.
- **Verb governance scope**: How much action mediation do you want? Advisory (suggest verbs) vs Enforcing (require ontological permission)?
- **n8n deployment priority**: This emerged as critical infrastructure. Prioritize over remaining onboarding tasks?

## FALSIFIER

This clarescence is wrong if:
1. The Sovereign's operational reality doesn't decompose into typed entities with state machines — if the Sovereign's work is fundamentally fluid/narrative rather than entity-relational
2. The integration cost of maintaining cross-substrate reconciliation exceeds the value of unified queries
3. Verb governance creates friction that slows execution without preventing errors (over-engineering trap)
4. A commercial "personal Palantir" product launches before we complete the kernel, making build-from-scratch unnecessary
5. The existing 10 entity types + ontology.db are sufficient without the expansions proposed here

**Confidence**: High (88%). Multiple verification sources:
- 4 frontier AI models independently converging on the same architecture
- 2 prior clarescence records (truth-surfaces, task-arch-ontology) pointing the same direction
- Existing infrastructure (ontology.db, frontmatter, MCP servers) partially implementing the pattern
- INT-MI19 active since Session 12+ with consistent Sovereign commitment
