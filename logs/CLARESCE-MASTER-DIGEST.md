## 1. Architectural Evolution Arc

**Feb 4–5 (A):** System declared architecturally mature but stalled at ~40% operational
capacity. Named the "Sophistication Plateau" — 15 backlog items at zero execution, 120
uncommitted changes, Adjudicator/Cartographer dormant. Core substrate decisions locked:
filesystem kanban (σ₀–σ₇ Strata), SaaS truth axis (Linear=T1a, ClickUp=T1b), MCP Tier 0.5,
three-editor role separation (WRITE/READ/DELEGATE), Ledger as mandatory atomic event log.

**Feb 8–9 (B–E):** Pivot from design to activation. Dual-machine architecture finalized:
Field Kit (MBA) + HQ (Mac mini), Tailscale bridge, chezmoi dotfiles. DEC-SOV-009 inscribed
constitutionally (self-improvement as obligation). 53+ MCP tools activated (first session with
native MCP). Claresce3 triple-pass methodology introduced. El Dorado armory audit revealed
Adjudicator/Cartographer armed with zero skills, zero security across constellation. Wave
installation structure (0–6) produced.

**Feb 9 (C–D):** Ajna permanently anchored to MBA (Kimi K2.5 / NVIDIA NIM). Discord
24-channel architecture deployed. Slack dual-bot topology designed (DEC-SLACK-BOT-INVERSION).
Relay pattern established (Psyche as Slack synthesizer for CLI-only agents). El Dorado: three
revelations — Unarmed Agents, Security Vacuum, Cross-Agent Blindspot.

**Feb 10–11 (F):** Claresce3v2 delivered 6.3/10 coherence score with failing T1a↔T2 chain
(1/174 items linked). SOVEREIGN-009 ratified — single 15-min decision unblocked entire
downstream. Palantir tripartite architecture validated by 4-model chorus (Semantic + Kinetic +
Dynamic). 4-Layer Personal Ontology Kernel adopted. Cartographer HIBERNATED (6 tasks, 395
lines total output). Verdict: "The machine is built — run it."

**Feb 12–15 (G):** Hard-gate skills wired to CLAUDE.md (DEC-C3). watch_dispatch.sh
deprecated (DA-AO-001) — dual watcher race caused 0-byte output. Three-Layer Autonomic
Architecture deployed. Meta-clarescence fidelity audit: 321 commitments, 39% delivered,
activation gap = 0% of activation sequences completed. 86% deferred commitment loss rate.

**Feb 16–17 (G–J):** Convergence injection: Rosetta v2.5→v2.7.0 (+70 terms, Categories
18–24), Runbook v2.0→v3.0.0 (Dual-Path). 267-file research corpus partitioned into 14
NotebookLM notebooks. Scaffold coverage audited at 12% of convergence vision. Three Breakage
Loops forensically documented. Three-Layer Autonomic nervous system fully operational. Neural
Bridge (bidirectional SSH) verified. Verdict: "The factory is built — build the product."

## 3. Seared Lessons

### launchd Absolutism (The .zshrc Illusion)
- launchd NEVER sources ~/.zshrc — ever. Fix in .zshrc is invisible to launchd services.
- Correct: plist EnvironmentVariables OR explicit `eval` load in service script (belt-and-suspenders).
- `~` does not expand in plist XML — hardcode absolute paths (/Users/system, not ~).
- `flock` is Linux-only; use PID-file lock on macOS.
- macOS TCC blocks direct script exec in launchd; use `bash "$SCRIPT"` not `"$SCRIPT"`.

### Verification Theater (Anti-Pattern)
- `grep config-file` proves config EXISTS, not that it WORKS.
- `ps eww -p $PID | grep VAR` is runtime verification.
- Always verify from WITHIN the actual execution context (launchd, tmux, ssh).
- `ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 mini hostname` — never ping (ICMP blocked by Stealth Mode).

### Async Verification Gap
- Fix → commit → dispatch audit (async) → don't wait → commit next fix → audit returns FAIL → too late.
- NEVER commit a fix without blocking verification.

### Context Decay
- 86% deferred commitment loss rate (12/15 OPEN, 0 IN_PROGRESS after compaction).
- Compaction destroys navigability. Promises evaporate. Persist state to filesystem before compaction.
- Commit durable artifacts; no completion claim without repo evidence.

### Dispatch Rules
- NEVER dispatch without Reply-To and CC fields. One-way dispatch is a coordination failure.
- Use dispatch.sh (auto-injects both) or set manually.
- NEVER re-enable watch_dispatch.sh — races with auto_ingest, produces 0-byte output.
- `--` required before `-INBOX` paths (leading dash parsed as flag by shell utilities).
- Cartographer: workspace sandboxing blocks cross-workspace paths; copy files into workspace first.

### Security
- 27% of ClawHub's 5,705 skills are spam/malicious. skill-vetting is mandatory.
- `prompt-guard` skill explicitly flagged for credential exfiltration — DO NOT INSTALL.
- NEVER install ClawHub skills before security gate (Trail of Bits, OpenAI trilogy, skill-vetting).
- OpenClaw instances exposed on Shodan with no auth — supply chain attack surface is capability set.
- 234 unaudited skills = live credential exfiltration risk.

### OpenClaw Routing
- Two-level model resolution: `provider/modelId` in agent config → bare `modelId` in provider block.
- `bun` is OpenClaw's node manager; skills install via `npx skills add obra/lace@<skill> -g -y`.
- `install.nodeManager` key in openclaw.json must be `"bun"`.

### Agent Reliability (2026-02-17 grades)
- Psyche: Grade A (delivers with verification evidence, intellectual honesty)
- Adjudicator: Grade B (capable, pauses at decision points, needs unsticking)
- Commander mm: Grade B+ (substantial deliverable, minor coord overhead)
- Cartographer: Grade F for creation tasks (narrates instead of executes; sensing/survey tasks only)

## 4. Core Architectural Constructs

### σ₀–σ₇ Sovereignty Strata
Organizing principle for all tool onboarding and attention allocation:
σ₀ Sovereign Attention → σ₁ Shell/Terminal → σ₂ Editor → σ₃ Filesystem → σ₄ Local Services →
σ₅ Agent Orchestration → σ₆ MCP/Integration → σ₇ Execution Surfaces (Antigravity, Codex App, Claude Desktop, OpenClaw, Gemini CLI)
"Three Integration Rings" retired. σ₀ attention is the binding constraint as σ₇ proliferates.

### Filesystem Kanban (Canonical Dispatch Substrate)
`00-INBOX0/` (watch target) → `10-IN_PROGRESS/` → `20-WAITING/` → `30-BLOCKED/` →
`40-DONE/` → `50_FAILED/` → `90_ARCHIVE/` / `RECEIPTS/`
7 required properties: Inbox-0 semantics, atomic moves, receipt durability, artifact separation,
hub-spoke preservation, simple grepability, concurrent watcher safety.

### Three-Layer Autonomic Architecture
- Layer 1 (spinal cord): auto_ingest_loop.sh — 30s poll, task execution
- Layer 2 (brainstem): watchdog — 60s health monitoring + recovery
- Layer 3 (prefrontal): proactive_orchestrator.sh — 300s, work generation + DYN-CONSTELLATION_STATE.md

### Dual-Path Lens System (Runbook v3.0.0)
- Path 1 (18 Wisdom Lenses): Bitter Lesson, Antifragile, Systems Thinking, Potency Without Resolution
  Loss, Syncrescendent Route, Meet the Moment, Steelman & Redteam, Personal Idiosyncrasies,
  Elegance + Dev Happiness, First Principles, Complexity Theory, Agentify, Pareto 80/20,
  Trade-off Explicit, Narrative Coherence, Compression, Falsifiability, Recursive Amplification
- Path 2 (18 Engineering Lenses): unchanged canonical set from v2.0.0
- Protocol: Tactical = Path 2 only; Operational/Strategic = both; Strategic combined ≥24/36

### Palantir Tripartite Ontology Architecture
- Semantic Layer: what exists (typed entities, properties, relationships)
- Kinetic Layer: what can be done (actions, governed verbs, agent bindings, write-back)
- Dynamic/Governance Layer: how it evolves (security, permissions, adaptation)
- Physics Layer (Phase D, future): simulation, prediction, digital twins
Validated by 4-model chorus (ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Grok) independently converging.

### 4-Layer Personal Ontology Kernel
- Layer 0: Organ Apps (Obsidian, Notion, Linear — tributaries)
- Layer 1: Storage Substrates (SQLite, Qdrant, Graphiti)
- Layer 2: Semantic Core (typed entities + state machines + governed verbs)
- Layer 3: Integration Pipelines
- Layer 4: AI Agents (type AGT, states, capabilities, resource constraints)
MVK = typed entities + state transitions + verbs + versioned history + action mediation (5 required, no fewer).

### 5-Layer Exocortex
Constellation + SaaS + Ontology + Sovereignty unified as cognitive prosthesis:
1. Sensorium (inbound data, 65% aligned)
2. Ontology of Self (semantic core, 80% aligned)
3. Agency Layer (agent orchestration, 85% aligned)
4. Sovereignty Layer (trust/identity, 50% aligned)
5. Reflexive Intelligence (sensemaking/clarescence, 70% aligned)

### SaaS Truth Axis (Canonical Assignments)
T0 = Intention Compass (vision). T1a = Linear (repo-bound execution). T1b = ClickUp (meta/life).
T2 = IMPL-MAP (ad hoc). Slack = operational bus. Discord = agent habitat (Ajna-primary).
Make = router only, never canonical. Ledger events = lifecycle truth; filename suffixes are cache.

### Neural Bridge
MBA → Mac mini: `ssh mini` (key: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_ajna)
Mac mini → MBA: `ssh macbook-air` (key: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_ajna_to_psyche)
ICMP ping blocked by Stealth Mode. CONFIRM SCP-back: auto_ingest delivers CONFIRM to originating
machine immediately without waiting for git sync.

### Claresce3 Triple-Pass Methodology
Pass 1 = Atomization (pure inventory, no interpretation)
Pass 2 = Alignment (cross-referential, charitable interpretation)
Pass 3 = Annealment (convergent synthesis, crystallized priority stack)
Charitable interpretation: read every apparent failure against its most generous reading first.

## 5. Strategic Convergence State

### Tri-Helical Strategy (3 synchronized timelines)
1. Technological Maturity (external pacing clock): A=85%, S=40%, P=15%, T=5%
2. Business Trajectory: Architecture→Embodiment→Education→Business→Events→Nodes→Way Places (irreversible)
3. Personal Trajectory: 6-year skill development (IBEW Year 1 → journey-level Year 5)

### 28 Convergence Domains (scaffold coverage)
CAPTURED (8, 29%): Philosophical Foundations, Tri-Helical Strategy, Platform Architecture,
Rhetorical Calibration, Four-Stage Curriculum, Compositional Hierarchy, Economic Model,
Civilizational Context.
PARTIAL (16, 57%): Content Strategy, Curriculum Ops, Instrumentation, Physical Infrastructure,
Community Governance, Field Nodes, Live Events, Personal Trajectory, Phased Timeline, Content
Brand Architecture, Alchemizing Catalyst, Compliance/Safety, Risk Frameworks, Three-Rail OS,
Content Distribution, Network Architecture.
MISSING (4, 14%): Instrumentation Architecture (3-tier Helpers/Demonstrators/Nodelets),
World-Shards (bounded simulation spec), Kill Criteria/Anti-Patterns (A/S/P/T gates),
Network Replication (open-source replication model).

### Maturity Gates (A/S/P/T)
Four normalized 0–5 scales published monthly. Kill criterion: Thread→RSVP <3% for two weeks.
Currently MISSING from scaffold (no CANON file).

### Causal Chain (10 stages)
CONCEPTUAL ARCHITECTURE → PERSONAL EMBODIMENT → EDUCATIONAL VALIDATION → ECONOMIC
SUSTAINABILITY → EXPERIENTIAL DIMENSION → CAPITAL ACCUMULATION → PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE →
DEMONSTRATION VIABILITY → NETWORK REPLICATION → CIVILIZATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE

### 5 Named Anti-Patterns
1. Cohorts before Patreon
2. Platform Sprawl (4th channel before 3 excellent)
3. Architectural Churn (renaming primitives faster than teaching them)
4. Unlogged Claims (claim without micro-demo = story, not step)
5. Scope Creep at Malibu (prove one slice before expanding)

### Five Phases (DOC-B, authoritative sequencing)
Phase I (Months 1–24): Computational/Text only
Transition (Months 22–30): Brand Identity
Phase II (Months 31–54): Visual/YouTube
Phase III (Months 55–90): Engineering/IBEW
Phase IV (Months 91–126): Field Node
Phase V (Months 127+): Network Replication

### Research Corpus Intelligence
267 research files (2026-01-08 to 2026-02-14), 14 NotebookLM notebooks.
External validation: independent practitioners converged on identical architecture
(filesystem coordination, personality file alignment, progressive disclosure, hooks as infrastructure).
Key external insights: Progressive Disclosure as universal context loading pattern;
Three-Layer Memory (KG + daily notes + tacit); observational memory = 94.87% LongMemEval;
Judgment Engineering as the leverage unit; Data Layer Sovereignty as the moat.

## 6. Persistent Gaps & Open Commitments

### P0 Critical
- **COCKPIT.md stale**: shows watch_dispatch active (deprecated), wrong service count (12, now 8).
  Kaizen autopsy designated P0 reconciliation — not yet complete.
- **Revenue: $0, INT-1201 FAILED**. No reset target set. Sovereign decision required.
- **4 MISSING scaffold domains**: Instrumentation Architecture, World-Shards, Kill Criteria/Anti-Patterns,
  Network Replication — structural pillars with no CANON representation.
- **5 P0 Convergence Injection files**: Economic Model, Alchemizing Catalyst, Content Brand
  Architecture, Tri-Helical Synchronization, Curriculum Architecture.
- **Ontology Bridge gap**: 128-entity gap (183 at v2.5.0 vs. 311 at v2.7.0). Deferred.

### Structural / Chronic
- **DC-004**: Committed to Rosetta Category 17, partially delivered. Cross-session follow-up rate = 14%.
- **Sovereign action queue**: 13 items as of Feb 15, some 3+ weeks old. Drain rate < accumulation rate.
- **Cartographer offline for creation tasks**: workspace sandboxing + narration pattern.
  Restricted to sensing/survey tasks only. Effective offline for anything requiring file creation.
- **Elaboration over Execution (chronic)**: Meta-audit: 321 commitments, 39% delivered.
  Pre-canon: 13 clarescences in one day, 19% delivery, 50:1 analysis:execution ratio.
  Hard-gate skills (DEC-C3) are the systemic mitigation now in place.
- **Proactive orchestrator busywork risk**: Generating ~384K tokens/day of health-check pings
  instead of substantive deferred-commitment tasks. Needs evolution to intention-compass dispatch.
- **Cross-notebook resonance**: NotebookLM cannot query across notebooks. IMPL-P-0016 not built.
- **Gemini CLI API key (IMPL-F-0004)**: Blocks Cartographer reactivation and Google Conductor install.
- **NB01 approaching 50-source NotebookLM limit**: Notebook split protocol needed.
- **ARCH-CONSTELLATION_AGENT_LOOPS.md**: Not updated since watch_dispatch deprecation.
