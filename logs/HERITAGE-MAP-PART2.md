## Section A — CANON-31xxx Concepts

| Concept | Old Location | Class | Semantic Address | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| INFORMATION Chain (Four-Stage Trajectory) | CANON-31000 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A1+A2 | Perceptual sophistication development (Pattern Recognition→Embodied Knowing) derives from A1 (coherence under overload) + A2 (capacity before intelligence). Stage progression is capacity-gated. |
| Seven Archaeological Domains | CANON-31000 | HERITAGE | AGENCY:Ring2 | Prescient: systematic scanning territory prevents attentional fragmentation (A1). Reframe needed: from "information gathering" to "coherence-preserving signal selection" under A1's scarce-resource lens. |
| ACUMEN Planetary (Air element / awareness coils) | CANON-31100 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A1 | Generating "refined awareness coils" back to core is a direct expression of A1. The 4-tier Priority Band (Immediate/Curated/Archive/Prune) is an operationalized σ₀ Bottleneck (T1). |
| Priority Band (4-tier signal qualification) | CANON-31100 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / T1 | This IS the σ₀ Attention Bottleneck theorem in applied form. Qualifies signals by cognitive cost before admission. Already a core derivation. |
| Dual-Stream Intelligence (80/20 automated/serendipitous) | CANON-31100 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A2 | Capacity constraint (A2) justifies automated majority: preserves activation energy for high-value serendipity. Derives cleanly. |
| Five IICs (Acumen/Coherence/Efficacy/Mastery/Transcendence) | CANON-31100 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4 | IIC = identity-bounded intent-artifact pipeline. Each IIC is one A4 traversal domain (capture→distill→model→activate→verify) scoped by chain. |
| Progressive Activation (one IIC per 6 months) | CANON-31100 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | This IS A2 expressed as operational policy: capacity before scope. Prevents overload by serializing activation. |
| FEEDCRAFT — Nine Platform Functional Categories | CANON-31110 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A1+A2 | Substitution-based platform taxonomy defends cognitive substrate (A1). Nine categories operationalize differential sovereignty. Derives from A1+A2. |
| Three Cognitive Modes (Aesthetic/Empirical/Strategic) | CANON-31110 | HERITAGE | SELF:Ring1 | Prescient: three modes prevent modal collapse (all input processed identically). Reframe needed: explicitly map to capacity states (A2) — Aesthetic = depleted mode, Empirical = baseline, Strategic = peak. |
| Five Constitutional Principles of FEEDCRAFT | CANON-31110 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A1 | Material Sovereignty and Temporal Architecture directly operationalize A1 (remaining oneself under platform manipulation). Others derive. |
| Resonance Calculation (weighted scoring) | CANON-31110 | VESTIGIAL | AGENCY:Ring2 | Weighted formula (Community 40%, Modal 30%, etc.) implies false precision. A2 (capacity constraint) makes per-platform arithmetic impractical at operational tempo. Fails A2 derivation as daily practice. |
| Substitution Principle | CANON-31110 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A1 | "Which gap is unfillable?" is a clean A1-derived test: which platform does the most coherence-preserving work? Retains full value. |
| IIC IMPL / Acumen IIC Implementation (daily cycle) | CANON-31115 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4 | Daily Intelligence Cycle is an A4 traversal (capture evening→distill overnight→activate morning→verify strategic review). Fully derives. |
| Recommendation Scoring System (composite metric) | CANON-31115 | HERITAGE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A2 | Prescient signal: Signal Density and Novelty multipliers recognize that not all attention costs equally (A2). Reframe needed: simplify from 5-factor weighted formula to a 3-tier pass/flag/prune based on capacity state. Complexity overhead undermines A2. |
| Aggregation-of-Aggregators methodology | CANON-31115 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A1+A2 | Three-layer filtering (Frontier→Expert→Personal) reduces attention cost while preserving coherence. Derives from A1+A2. |
| Heat Mapping (keyword frequency / discourse tracking) | CANON-31115 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4 | Heat mapping is model-layer work in A4 (distill→model). Legitimate epistemic tool. |
| TONE LIBRARY — 10 Rhetorical Functions + 10 Stylistic Forms | CANON-31120 | NATIVE | WORK:Ring3 / A4 | Content production as A4 intent-artifact pipeline. Rhetorical functions = activation layer; stylistic forms = artifact layer. Derives from A4. |
| Production Workflow (9 phases) | CANON-31120 | NATIVE | WORK:Ring3 / A4 | 9-phase workflow is a full A4 traversal made explicit: Concept→Audience→Recipe→Draft→Quality→Revision→Publication→Engagement→Iteration. |
| Guardrail 05 (No Philosophical Maximalism) | CANON-31120 | SEED | WORK:Ring3 / A1 | This IS A1 applied to output: groundedness is a coherence constraint, not a stylistic preference. Already a core rule. |
| 5 Starter Recipes | CANON-31120 | VESTIGIAL | WORK:Ring3 | Recipe templates are tool-shaped artifacts. At current scale (Modal 1), AI can generate recipe variations on demand. Static list becomes shelf-ware (T2 Anti-Shelfware theorem). |
| TONE TAXONOMY (11 taxonomies, 90 entries) | CANON-31121 | HERITAGE | WORK:Ring3 / A4 | Prescient: recipient archetypes (Novice through Portfolio Evaluator) reflect that content must traverse to its target (A4:activate→verify). Reframe needed: collapse 90-entry reference to a 10-archetype decision tree; current size creates friction at point of use. |
| RHETORICAL CALIBRATION — 5 Voice Principles | CANON-31122 | SEED | WORK:Ring3 / A1 | Intellectual Warmth + Clarity + Proportion + Recursive Deepening + Rhythm are A1 derivations: voice consistency maintains identity-coherence under fragmentation pressure across platforms. |
| Anti-Patterns Catalog (14 named violations) | CANON-31122 | NATIVE | WORK:Ring3 / A1 | Prohibiting Ceremonial Openings, Hedging Excess, Philosophical Maximalism, etc. enforces A1 at output layer. |
| Platform-Specific Registers (X/LinkedIn/Medium/YouTube/Instagram) | CANON-31122 | NATIVE | WORK:Ring3 / A1 | Register adaptation without identity fragmentation is A1's core challenge. Legitimate derivation. |
| SEVEN-LAYER STACK (L0–L7) | CANON-31130 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A3 | Schema Sovereignty (T3) requires explicit layer mapping: which layers are sovereign (L0 Physical, L1 Identity), which are cache (L2-L6). The Stack makes T3 operational. |
| Differential Sovereignty | CANON-31130 | SEED | AGENCY:Ring2 / A3 | This IS T3 (Schema Sovereignty) named at the platform-coupling level. Already a core theorem expression. |
| L7 Meta-Intelligence (cross-IIC synthesis) | CANON-31130 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4 | Cross-IIC synthesis is A4's verify layer: confirming that the full pipeline produces integrated understanding, not siloed outputs. |
| IIC CONSTELLATION — Identity-Intelligence Complex | CANON-31140 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4+A3 | Each IIC = sovereign identity node + dedicated A4 pipeline. The constellation is A3 (repo as ground truth) applied to identity infrastructure. |
| Guiding Virtue Triads (per IIC) | CANON-31140 | HERITAGE | SELF:Ring1 | Prescient: virtue-anchored identity prevents role-collapse when operating multiple accounts. Reframe needed: from character-development language to coherence-preservation functions (A1) — each virtue triad specifies what "remaining oneself" looks like within that IIC's domain. |
| Integration Flow (Acumen→Coherence→Efficacy→Mastery→Transcendence→Acumen) | CANON-31140 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4 | Circular integration mirrors A4's pipeline; each chain's output becomes the next chain's input (distill→model feedback loop). |
| FIVE-ACCOUNT ARCHITECTURE (per-IIC operational specs) | CANON-31141 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4 | Operational specifications instantiate A4 traversal per chain domain. Teleological output + AI mediation thresholds = activation and verify gates. |
| PLATFORM GRAMMAR (per-platform interaction protocols) | CANON-31142 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A1+A3 | Interaction protocols enforce A3 (sovereign defaults) against platform-default manipulation. Enshittification early-warning signals are A1 threat detection. |
| FEED CURATION — "cognitive substrate engineering" | CANON-31143 | SEED | AGENCY:Ring2 / A1 | The reframe from "information hygiene" to "deliberate cognitive substrate engineering" IS A1 stated at its most precise. Already core. |
| Three-Layer Integration (Feedcraft/IIC/Feed Curation) | CANON-31143 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4 | Physics→Teleology→Methodology maps to A4's capture→model→activate sequence. |
| PLATFORM CAPABILITY CATALOG (auto-generated) | CANON-31150 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A3 | Auto-generation from JSON (temporal data) with evergreen template structure is A3 applied to documentation: the repo is ground truth; tool assignments are live state, not memorized lists. |
| 10-Avatar Constellation Architecture | CANON-31150 | VESTIGIAL | AGENCY:Ring2 | 10-avatar model (Oracle/Vanguard/Commander trios) is superseded by the Constellation's actual 5-agent architecture plus Intelligence Tiering (Tier 1–4) identified in gap analysis. Architectural mismatch with current state. |
| Neo-Bloomberg Terminal metaphor | CANON-31150 | VESTIGIAL | ADMINISTRATIVE | Metaphor served as framing scaffold during design. The IIC architecture stands without it. No load-bearing semantic content. |

## Section B — CANON-32-35xxx Concepts

| Concept | Old Location | Class | Semantic Address | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| INSIGHT Chain — Hermeneutic Sophistication | CANON-32000 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A1 | Interpretive capacity development directly serves A1: richer hermeneutic capacity = higher resistance to persuasion/fragmentation. |
| Cross-Chain Synchronization Rules (±2 stage tolerance) | CANON-32000 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A2 | Synchronization prevents capacity overload from chain imbalance (A2). The ±2 rule is a concrete T1 (σ₀ Bottleneck) management heuristic. |
| Safeguards (Syncretism Prevention, Intellectual Bypass, Framework Imprisonment) | CANON-32000 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A1 | These three safeguards ARE A1 operationalized: each names a failure mode of coherence under persuasion (syncretism), under cognitive ease (bypass), and under schema lock-in (imprisonment). |
| COHERENCE Planetary — Seven Fundamental Partitions | CANON-32100 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A1 | Ontological/Epistemological/Axiological/Temporal/Causal/Structural/Phenomenological partitions structure the "remaining oneself" architecture (A1). |
| Five Pitfalls of Coherence (Framework Proliferation, Syncretism, Dogmatic Closure, etc.) | CANON-32100 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A1 | Each pitfall is a named A1 failure mode: coherence lost to proliferation, confusion, or rigidity. |
| COHERENCE SYNTHESIS SYSTEM — Five Degrees (Recognition→Transmission) | CANON-32110 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A4 | Degree progression mirrors A4 pipeline: Recognition (capture) → Exploration (distill) → Commitment (model) → Integration (activate) → Transmission (verify). Independence from Stage/Level prevents premature crystallization. |
| Backward integration requirement (cannot skip degrees) | CANON-32110 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | Enforces A2: capacity must be built before advancing. No intelligence shortcuts around established foundations. |
| META-ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK — 15 Lenses across 5 Families | CANON-32120 | NATIVE | WORLD:Ring5 / A1 | Civilizational sense-making lenses prevent worldview fragmentation at Ring 5 scale. A1 applied beyond the individual. |
| 8 convergent insights (civilizational synthesis output) | CANON-32120 | NATIVE | WORLD:Ring5 / A4 | Synthesis output is A4's verify layer at civilizational scale. |
| EXPERTISE Chain — Economic capability | CANON-33000 | NATIVE | WORK:Ring3 / A4 | Translating understanding into sustainable economic contribution is A4's terminal verify: value only crystallizes when traversal is complete and rewarded in the world. |
| Decision Quality Framework (Ontological/Teleological/Resource/Temporal) | CANON-33100 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | "Resource Reality (what capacity permits)" IS A2 as a decision gate. The four dimensions map to A1-A4 in order. Already a core derivation lattice. |
| Volitional capacity cultivation | CANON-33100 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | Volition is the agency layer of A2: capacity is not only energy but will to deploy it. |
| BIZ BACKBONE — Four-Level business trajectory | CANON-33110 | NATIVE | WORK:Ring3 / A4 | Business trajectory (Initial→Mastery) is A4 applied to economic domain: intent crystallizes into sustainable operation at Mastery level. |
| Consulting tiers ($3K-7K / $10K-18K / $25K-50K) | CANON-33111 | VESTIGIAL | WORK:Ring3 | Point-in-time revenue figures with specific dollar ranges become stale quickly. The tiering logic (sprint/program/partnership) is NATIVE; the figures are ADMINISTRATIVE. |
| Batch production system (Mon-Fri schedule) | CANON-33111 | NATIVE | WORK:Ring3 / A2 | Batching protects capacity (A2) by reducing context-switching cost. The specific day assignments are ADMINISTRATIVE but the batching principle is load-bearing. |
| Revenue Model Reconciliation (4-Level → 3-Phase mapping) | CANON-33112 | HERITAGE | WORK:Ring3 / A4 | Prescient: mapping idealistic framework to conservative economic reality is honest A4 verification (does the pipeline actually produce value?). Reframe needed: update to treat the mapping pattern (not the figures) as canonical; specific projections are metabolizable data, not schema. |
| KNOWLEDGE Chain — Embodiment as core purpose | CANON-34000 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A4 | Embodiment IS A4's terminal stage: value crystallizes when it becomes automatic competence, not stored knowledge. Already axiom-level. |
| MASTERY Planetary — 10,000 hour guideline | CANON-34100 | VESTIGIAL | SELF:Ring1 | 10,000-hour heuristic is pop-science aggregation (Ericsson's deliberate practice research is more nuanced). Fails precision test. The stage-gating mechanism (A2) is native; the specific number is not load-bearing. |
| Four Curriculum Stages mapped to Modal Sequence | CANON-34110 | SEED | WORLD:Ring5 / A4 | Modal Sequence (Abstract→Simulated→Physical→Transcendent) IS the A4 pipeline at civilizational timescale. Stage-Modal alignment is already axiomatic. |
| Tri-helical synchronization (Technological/Instructor/Student) | CANON-34110 | NATIVE | COMMUNITY:Ring4 / A2 | Three-capacity synchronization is A2 applied to pedagogical deployment: all three must have adequate capacity before next stage advances. |
| Technology Stage 1 (AI fluency) as universal prerequisite | CANON-34110 | SEED | COMMUNITY:Ring4 / A2 | AI fluency as gate is A2 operationalized at community scale: without this capacity, subsequent stages are blocked. Already implicit axiom. |
| MASTERY SYLLABUS — specific tool versions (Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, etc.) | CANON-34120 | ADMINISTRATIVE | WORK:Ring3 | Tool-specific, version-dated content. Update rhythm (6-12 months) acknowledges its own perishability. Structure is NATIVE; specific tool names are ADMINISTRATIVE. |
| Update rhythm philosophy (tool recs 6-12mo, curriculum 18-36mo) | CANON-34120 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A3 | Differential update cadence enforces A3: stable schema (curriculum structure) vs. perishable cache (tool names). |
| WISDOM Chain — emerges last from all chains | CANON-35000 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A4 | WISDOM as terminal synthesis is A4 at its highest integration: verify that all traversals cohere into something beyond their sum. Already axiomatic in the 4-axiom structure. |
| TRANSCENDENCE Ring/σ — contains entire system | CANON-35100 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A1 | Quintessence element / Strategic Harmony / harmonic resonance management is A1 at meta level: preventing destructive interference between chains is coherence preservation for the whole system. |
| Five Degrees of Meta-Cognitive Integration | CANON-35110 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A4+A1 | Mirrors Coherence's Five Degrees (A4) but oriented vertically (ascending integration) rather than horizontally. Both patterns derive. First-Person/Third-Person/Non-Dual Meta maps to A1's "remaining oneself" at increasing abstraction layers. |
| Universal Energy State Topology (Peak/Baseline/Depletion/Crisis) | CANON-35120 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | This IS A2 made explicit and measurable. The four-state model is the operational core of "Capacity Before Intelligence." Already the most direct named instantiation of A2 in the canon. |
| "AuDHD lens reveals universal human variation" | CANON-35120 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | The claim that neurodivergent adaptations serve all practitioners is A2's generalization: capacity constraints are universal, not edge cases. Already a core philosophical stake. |
| "Frameworks serve practitioners, not vice versa" | CANON-35120 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | This IS A2's corollary: if a framework consumes more capacity than it returns, it violates A2. Already core. |
| AuDHD Implementation Patterns (Spiky profile, Knowing-Doing gap, Broken fuel gauge) | CANON-35121 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | Specific patterns (akrasia amplified, energy perception dysregulation, RSD) are named failure modes of A2 under neurodivergent conditions. Justice sensitivity and stimming as regulatory tools derive from A2's optimization logic. |
| GAIAN FIELD NODE — self-sufficient regenerative infrastructure | CANON-35200 | NATIVE | WORLD:Ring5 / A3+A4 | Field Node is A3 (sovereignty) instantiated physically: repo-ground-truth extended to physical infrastructure. A4's verify stage at civilization scale: intent traversal complete only when embodied in built form. |
| Network scaling (1→5-8→20-30→50-100 nodes over 20 years) | CANON-35200 | NATIVE | WORLD:Ring5 / A4 | Replication via open-source documentation is A4's verify pattern: the pipeline is proven when others can traverse it independently. |
| Capital range ($800K-$1.8M) | CANON-35200 | ADMINISTRATIVE | WORLD:Ring5 | Point-in-time financial estimate. The scaling logic is NATIVE; the specific capital figure is perishable. |
| METAHUMANISM FRAMEWORK — Six Parts | CANON-35210 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A1 | Philosophical substrate for remaining-oneself (A1) at maximum depth. The six parts (Belief Systems, Epistemic Stratigraphy, Volition, Spiritual Planes, Causation, Essentia) collectively define what "self" is that one is preserving. |
| Epistemic Stratigraphy (12 strata: Sensory→Integral) | CANON-35210 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A1+A4 | Strata map the full territory of A4's capture layer: what types of knowing exist that the pipeline must traverse. |
| Volition Framework (Frankfurt hierarchy, 5 stages) | CANON-35210 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | Frankfurt's hierarchy of desires maps directly to A2: first-order desires consume capacity; meta-volition manages what desires to have. Capacity before intelligence starts here. |
| Philosophical foundation derived LAST (bottom of tree, not top) | CANON-35210 (pattern) | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A4 | The inversion (foundation emerges from practice, not vice versa) IS A4's epistemology: value crystallizes through traversal, not through prior declaration. Already structural axiom. |
| Pattern: Five Degrees reused across Coherence and Transcendence lunar systems | CANON-32110, 35110 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A4 | The Five Degrees (Recognition→Transmission) is a reusable A4 traversal template applicable at any domain depth. The pattern generalizes; likely extends to remaining chains. |
| Pattern: Four-Stage trajectories structurally parallel across all chains | All chain files | SEED | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4 | Parallel four-stage structure with multigenerational evidence at Stage 4 is A4's verify layer made universal: teaching-others IS the pipeline's terminal proof. |
| Pattern: Satellite files contain operational specifics; lunar/planetary hold ontological content | Meta-pattern | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A3 | Ontology-praxis separation enforces A3 (schema is sovereign) while allowing perishable data (satellite) to be updated without touching evergreen structure. |
| Pattern: Modal Sequence as temporal backbone (Abstract→Simulated→Physical→Transcendent) | 34110, 35200, 32120 | SEED | WORLD:Ring5 / A4 | Modal Sequence IS A4 at civilizational timescale: each modal epoch is a full pipeline pass at greater instantiation depth. Already implicit in all four axioms. |

## Section C — GAPS FILE Analysis

Each identified gap is classified against the 4 axioms or flagged OPEN for Phase 3.

| Gap | Source | Addressed By Axiom? | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------------------|-------|
| INT-1701: Progressive Disclosure (4-layer vault traversal) | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Context-loading as formal access pattern has no A1-A4 derivation. A4 touches it but doesn't formalize it as an ontology verb. Flag for V2 object taxonomy. |
| INT-1702: Judgment Engineering as Service | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Encoded judgment as computable governance derives from A3 (repo sovereignty) but the computable layer isn't specified in the axioms. Requires new construct. |
| INT-1703: Attention as Post-Labor Currency | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A1+A2 | A1 names attention as the scarce coherence resource; A2 names capacity as the binding constraint. The economics framing is an extension, not a gap. T1 (σ₀ Bottleneck) covers this. |
| INT-1704: Anti-Tool-Shaped-Object Discipline | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A2 | A2 (Capacity Before Intelligence) entails: tools must cost less capacity than they return. The "gate before tool" heuristic derives directly. Not a new axiom; needs formalization as A2 corollary. |
| INT-1705: Instruction→Skill→Hook maturity ladder | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Graduation pathway for operational primitives is not present in A1-A4. A4 traversal implies maturity staging but not a named 3-rung ladder. Add to action type taxonomy. |
| INT-1706: Data Layer Sovereignty | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A3 | A3 (Sovereignty Invariant: repo = ground truth, all else = cache) covers data asset sovereignty. Ontological Asset class is an implementation gap, not an axiom gap. |
| INT-1707: Three-Layer Memory Architecture (KG + Daily Notes + Tacit) | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A3+A4 | A3 (schema sovereignty) + A4 (pipeline: capture→distill→model) together imply a tripartite memory architecture. The synthesis framing is OPEN as a named construct; axioms address it partially. |
| INT-1708: Research→NotebookLM pipeline automation | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A4 | 14-step pipeline is A4 traversal made explicit. Gap is implementation, not axiomatic. Pipeline object type is OPEN for Phase 3 object taxonomy. |
| INT-1709: Security as existential constraint | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | OPEN (Phase 3) | None of A1-A4 address threat surfaces, credential exposure, or security boundaries. Security is a genuine axiom gap. Recommend A5 or a security corollary to A3. |
| INT-1711: Agent Vault = Human-Agent Shared Knowledge Graph | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A3 | Vault-as-ground-truth derives from A3. The shared-object framing is OPEN: A3 doesn't specify multi-party read/write semantics. Phase 3 object type needed. |
| INT-1712: Perimeter = capability, not network | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Capability-boundary perimeter model is not derivable from A1-A4. Related to security gap (INT-1709). Linked to A5 need. |
| INT-1801: Token Economics Dispatch | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A2 | Budget/quota as action mediators derive from A2: capacity constraint applies to compute tokens as directly as to human attention. Gap is formalization, not axiomatic absence. |
| INT-1802: Model Role Specialization (Tier 1–4) | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A2+A4 | Intelligence Tiering is A2 (right capacity for right task) + A4 (route through appropriate pipeline layer). Formalization as governance object is OPEN for Phase 3. |
| INT-1804: Antifragile Agent Infrastructure | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A4 | Self-healing = successful A4 traversal even under failure conditions (verify triggers recovery, not shutdown). Derives from A4. State transition model is OPEN. |
| INT-P017: File-First principle | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A3 | "Plain markdown outperforms specialized memory infrastructure" (ClawVault 74.0% vs 68.5%) supports A3: the simplest sovereign substrate wins. Tension with SQLite-first V1 is real and must be resolved in V2. OPEN as explicit stance. |
| INT-P018: Supersede, Never Delete | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A3 | A3 (repo as ground truth) entails immutable history: supersession preserves epistemic lineage; deletion destroys it. Derives from A3. Conflicts with V1 Purge permission — formalization conflict, not axiom gap. |
| INT-P019: Security as Binding Constraint | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | OPEN (Phase 3) | 200+ exposed instances confirm this is load-bearing, not aspirational. Same gap as INT-1709. Reinforces A5 need. |
| INT-P020: Verbatim Trap Test | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A4 | Synthesis must produce connections/tensions NOT already present in source (A4:distill requires genuine compression, not restatement). Derives from A4. Meta-gap, not object-type gap. |
| INT-P021: Knowledge-Code Isomorphism | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A3+A4 | Vault index = skill discovery = ontological surface derives from A3 (vault is ground truth) + A4 (vault as the pipeline's model layer). OPEN as named architectural stance. |
| INT-P022: Constellation pattern is emergent consensus | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Competitive positioning (moat analysis) has no derivation from A1-A4. Requires external-facing strategic axiom. Phase 3 context layer. |
| INT-P024: Intelligence Tiering | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A2 | Same as INT-1802. Derives from A2; formalization OPEN. |
| INT-P025: Agent Auto-Recovery | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A4 | Same as INT-1804. Derives from A4. |
| Narrative DNA (StarCraft/Dune/Halo taxonomy) absent from V1 | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §2 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Narrative frameworks provide architectural vocabulary, not axiomatic derivations. Phase 3 contextual layer. Dune Spice/attention-scarcity maps to A2 metaphorically; metaphor ≠ derivation. |
| Frontier Landscape / Competitive Context absent from V1 | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §3 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Gastown, Anthropic Hivemind, moat analysis are strategic context, not derivable from A1-A4. Phase 3 context layer needed. |
| DC-002: Skills security audit (credential exfiltration risk) | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §4 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Security domain absent from axioms. P0-CRITICAL. |
| DC-003: Plaintext key rotation | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §4 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Credential object type + governance lifecycle absent from A1-A4. P0-CRITICAL. |
| DC-004: ~25 pending Rosetta Stone ontological terms | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §4 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Highest-leverage gap. Terms are "intellectually resolved" but not committed. May add entire object categories before V2 taxonomy is finalized. P0. |
| DC-005: Agent fleet reliability sub-states | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §4 | A2 | Agent health beyond binary up/down derives from A2: reliability IS a capacity dimension. Formalization OPEN. |
| DC-006: Configured vs Operational state distinction | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §4 | A4 | Configured = intent captured; Operational = activated. The A4 pipeline's activate gate covers this distinction. Formalization OPEN. |
| DC-010: Live Ledger sensing pipeline | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §4 | A4 | Sensing pipeline is A4's capture layer made executable. SensingTask object type OPEN for Phase 3. |
| DC-011: Annotation/enrichment as action type | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §4 | A4 | Enrich/Annotate/PromoteStatus are A4 distill-layer verbs. Derivation present; formalization OPEN. |
| DC-012: Promotion action type lacks enforcement trigger | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §4 | A4+A3 | 17% delivery rate reveals A4's verify gate is unenforceable. A3 (repo sovereignty) requires commit-backed verification. Formalization OPEN. |
| Four-Systems Intake Architecture absent from V1 | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §5 | A4 | Automatic-Push / Curation-Push / On-Demand-Pull / Triage are the four modes of A4's capture layer. Full derivation from A4; object types OPEN for Phase 3. |
| Token Economics as first-class domain | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §6 | A2 | Budget/quota/tiering derive from A2 (capacity constraint applied to compute resources). Domain is absent from V1 as formalized objects; axiom coverage is present. P0 formalization gap. |
| Three-Layer Memory synthesis (KG + Daily Notes + Tacit) | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §7 | A3+A4 | Partially addressed above (INT-1707). Vault-as-Agent-Memory framing is the missing named construct. OPEN for Phase 3. |
| Security Domain entirely absent from V1 | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §8 | OPEN (Phase 3) | A1-A4 do not address threat surfaces. Represents the largest single axiom gap. Recommend: A5 (Security Invariant) or a Theorem T4 (Perimeter = Capability) derived as security corollary of A3. P0. |
| Cline/OpenCode as Tier 4 (INT-1803) | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §9 | A2 | Free/low-cost models for housekeeping = A2 applied to infrastructure: use the cheapest sufficient capacity. Tier classification OPEN for Phase 3 agent taxonomy. |
| HighCommand / Agendizer as existing ontology substrate | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §10 | A3 | A3 (repo = ground truth) prohibits reinventing what already exists. HighCommand audit is required before new kernel build. OPEN: reconciliation action, not axiom gap. |
| FDIS as Gaian Field Node engineering precursor | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §11 | A4 | FDIS is A4's modal-transition artifact: the pipeline stage before Field Node becomes the verify target. OPEN as named construct; Phase 3. |
| V1 vs INT-P017 (File-First vs SQLite) misalignment | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS, Misalignments §1 | A3 | A3 (sovereignty invariant) favors the substrate with highest ground-truth fidelity. ClawVault data suggests markdown. Tension is real and must be explicitly resolved in V2, not inherited. |
| V1 Purge vs INT-P018 Supersede conflict | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS, Misalignments §2 | A3 | A3 derivation favors Supersede: deleting from ground truth destroys epistemic lineage. V1 governance table must be corrected. Axiom resolves the conflict; governance table needs update. |
| V1 Kernel-first vs INT-1612 Automations-now tension | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS, Misalignments §3 | A2+A4 | A2 says build the capacity layer before deploying intelligence; A4 says crystallization only happens through traversal. The tension is productive: answer is incremental kernel build alongside activation, not sequential. OPEN as explicit architectural decision. |

## Summary: Genuine Axiom Gaps (Open for Phase 3)

The following gaps are NOT addressable by A1-A4 and require new constructs in Phase 3:

| Gap | Recommended Action |
|-----|--------------------|
| Security Domain (INT-1709, INT-1712, INT-P019, DC-002, DC-003) | Propose A5 (Security Invariant) or T4 (Perimeter = Capability, derived from A3) |
| Competitive Positioning / Moat Analysis | Phase 3 context layer; not axiom-derivable |
| Narrative DNA integration | Phase 3 vocabulary layer; metaphors support but don't derive from axioms |
| Progressive Disclosure as formal access pattern (INT-1701) | Phase 3 object type: ContextAccessProtocol |
| Judgment Engineering as computable governance (INT-1702) | Phase 3 object type: EncodedJudgment |
| Instruction→Skill→Hook maturity ladder (INT-1705) | Phase 3 action type taxonomy addition |
| DC-004 (~25 Rosetta Stone terms) | Must enumerate before Phase 3 taxonomy finalized; highest-leverage gap |
