# Session 22 Checkpoint — Neo-Canon Build

**Date**: 2026-02-18
**Agent**: Commander (Opus 4.6, MBA)
**Task**: TASK-20260217-neo-canon-metaplan.md
**Cadence**: on-change

## Completed

### Phase 1 — Metaplan (DONE)
- ARCH-NEO_CANON_METAPLAN.md (571 lines) — commit 54c2284
- 7 axiom candidates → 4 axioms + 3 theorems validated
- Cosmological ring structure designed (SELF→AGENCY→WORK→COMMUNITY→WORLD)

### Phase 2 — Parallel Agents (DONE)
- HERITAGE-MAP.md (422 lines) — 174 old-canon concepts classified
  - 26 SEED, 114 NATIVE, 17 HERITAGE, 13 VESTIGIAL, 4 ADMINISTRATIVE
  - 7 OPEN gaps for Phase 3
- SOURCES-MASTER-DIGEST.md (386 lines) — 86 external files digested
  - 40 thinkers mapped, 18 novel contributions, 10 gaps, 15 neo-canon candidates
- All in `impl/.scratch/` — commit 9e75935

### Phase 3 — Neo-Canon Core (DONE)
- ARCH-NEO_CANON_CORE.md (529 lines) — commit 5bba0e5
- The compiler specification: 4 axioms, 3 theorems, 21 entity types, 7 governed verbs
- 5-ring cosmological addressing, σ₀–σ₇ stack, all 4 software succession tests PASS

## Phase 4 — IN PROGRESS

### What must be produced:
1. **ARCH-NEO_SCAFFOLD.md** — operational layer derived from core axioms
   - Key questions: Does the 5-tier task architecture derive from axioms? What does σ₀ imply for scaffold design? What is the activation energy minimum?
2. **ARCH-NEO_EXOCORTEX.md** — five-layer cognitive prosthesis derived from core + scaffold
   - Key questions: How does each exocortex layer trace to axioms? What are the interfaces between layers? How does constellation fit?
3. **Grand Clarescence** — dual-path validation (18 wisdom + 18 engineering lenses), combined ≥24/36

### Key inputs for Phase 4:
- ARCH-NEO_CANON_CORE.md (the compiler — READ THIS)
- HERITAGE-MAP.md (174 concepts with semantic addresses)
- SOURCES-MASTER-DIGEST.md (external validation + challenges)
- REF-CLARESCENCE_RUNBOOK.md (dual-path lens system for grand clarescence)

### Open gaps from Phase 3:
- Security Domain (P0) — propose T4 or A5
- DC-004: 25 Rosetta terms (P0)
- DC-003: Credential governance (P0)
- Layer 3 Autonomic exits 1 (P1)
- Hard-Gate 0% delivery (P1)
- σ₂ build — File-First vs SQLite-First (P1)
- Narrative DNA (P2)

### Unresolved tensions:
- File-First vs SQLite-First (Sovereign adjudication needed)
- A2 self-dissolving at civilizational scale
- A4 completability (Deutsch critique)
- AI as tool vs subsystem
- Self-assessment inflation (27-point gap)
