**Generated**: 2026-01-17T03:23:54Z

## Requested Files Not Found

| File | Search Result | Impact | Workaround |
|------|---------------|--------|------------|
| oracle_memories.md | Not found anywhere in repo | Cannot extract Principal's accumulated learning patterns | Will infer from ORACLE13_CONTEXT.md and oracle_process_archaelogy.md |
| claude_code_research.md | Not found anywhere in repo | Missing Claude Code specific capability research | Will extract from platform_features.md and INTERACTION_PARADIGM.md |
| DYN-TREE.txt | Found as DYN-TREE.md instead | Non-issue (format variant) | Use DYN-TREE.md |

## Alternative Sources Identified

### For oracle_memories.md functionality:
- `./oracle_process_archaelogy.md` (28KB) - Contains process evolution history
- `./ORACLE13_CONTEXT.md` (6KB) - Contains current Oracle context
- `./oracle_verification_manifest.md` (15KB) - Contains verification patterns

### For claude_code_research.md functionality:
- `./platform_features.md` (60KB) - Contains multi-platform research including Claude
- `./INTERACTION_PARADIGM.md` (27KB) - Contains Claude Code interaction patterns
- `./frontier_models.md` (94KB) - Contains model capability assessments

## TODO Items for Future Passes

1. **Create oracle_memories.md**: Synthesize from oracle_process_archaelogy.md + ORACLE13_CONTEXT.md into a persistent memory document
2. **Create claude_code_research.md**: Extract Claude-specific capabilities from platform_features.md into dedicated reference

## Assessment

Missing files represent ~20% of requested inputs but critical functionality is covered by alternative sources. No blocking gaps for this visibility pass.
