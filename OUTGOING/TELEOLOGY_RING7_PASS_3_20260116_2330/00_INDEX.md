## KEY DEFINITIONS

**Terms used throughout this bundle:**

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Principal** | The human sovereign (you). Makes final decisions, owns accounts. |
| **Ring 7** | The outermost ring: execution substrate + tooling + neo-plugins. Only ring that touches reality. |
| **Cockpit** | A configured platform surface (chat window, project, app) with known rules. |
| **Packet** | A structured JSON/markdown artifact for inter-agent or inter-session communication. |
| **Teleology** | The "why" - purpose-driven reasoning for every architectural choice. |
| **Continuation Artifact** | A document that makes a conversation deletable without losing state. |
| **Crashout** | A failure mode where context is lost, requiring expensive retransmission. |
| **Ground Truth** | The repository. All persistent state lives here, not in conversations. |
