# QUEUE → ROADMAP MAPPING
## Reconciliation of Pending Work with Oracle Arc

**Audit Date**: 2026-01-02
**Auditor**: Claude Code (DIRECTIVE-034B)

## QUEUE/modal1/ (Current Capability Work)

| File | Size | Maps To | Oracle Scope | Status |
|------|------|---------|--------------|--------|
| AI_ECOSYSTEM_SURVEY.md | 24K | PROJ-003 (Tooling Stack) | Oracle11 | Waiting — blocked by PROJ-002 |
| CONTENT_PROCESSING_QUEUE.md | 2.5K | PROJ-001 (Transcript Ingestion) | Oracle9 | Active — template ready, no items queued |
| QUICK_WINS.md | 7K | PROJ-001/PROJ-002 | Oracle9-10 | Active — tactical opportunities |
| YOUTUBE_PROCESSING_BACKLOG.md | 7.5K | PROJ-001 (Transcript Ingestion) | Oracle9 | Active — channel triage complete |

**Assessment**: modal1/ items are correctly positioned for current work. AI_ECOSYSTEM_SURVEY is appropriately blocked waiting for IIC configuration. Processing queues support active ingestion work.

## QUEUE/modal2/ (Future Visual/Simulation Work)

| File | Size | Maps To | Oracle Scope | Status |
|------|------|---------|--------------|--------|
| AI_3D_VFX.md | 9K | PROJ-009 (Modal 2 Prep) | Future | Parked correctly |
| AI_Academic_Research.md | 8K | PROJ-009 (Modal 2 Prep) | Future | Parked correctly |
| AI_Image_Generators.md | 14K | PROJ-009 (Modal 2 Prep) | Future | Parked correctly |
| AI_Workflows_in_Video_and_VFX.md | 11K | PROJ-009 (Modal 2 Prep) | Future | Parked correctly |
| Physical_AI.md | 10K | PROJ-009 (Modal 2 Prep) | Future | Parked correctly |
| QUEUE-36200-SCREENPLAY_ORCHESTRATION.md | 4K | PROJ-009 (Modal 2 Prep) | Future | Parked correctly |
| The_Next_Wave_in_AI_Video_and_VFX.md | 16K | PROJ-009 (Modal 2 Prep) | Future | Parked correctly |

**Assessment**: Modal 2 content is correctly parked. All 7 files relate to 3D/VFX/Video synthesis work that becomes active when Modal 2 approaches. Combined 72K of research captured. No action required.

## QUEUE/pending/ (Inbox - Target: Zero)

| File | Size | Action | Destination |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| operational_engine.md | 9K | MOVE to OPERATIONAL | Contains IIC platform architecture - living document |
| operational_engine.md.NOTE | 1K | DELETE | Disposition note superseded by this mapping |

**Assessment**:
- `operational_engine.md` contains the "Alchemizing Catalyst" and platform deployment architecture. This is **living operational strategy** for PROJ-005 (Branding) and content platform work. Should move to OPERATIONAL/.
- The `.NOTE` file was a disposition query from DIRECTIVE-007; resolved by this audit.

**Inbox Zero Actions**:
1. Move `operational_engine.md` → `OPERATIONAL/operational_engine.md`
2. Delete `operational_engine.md.NOTE`
3. Verify pending/ is empty

## Connected Tasks (Added to tasks.csv)

| Task ID | Task | Project | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|-------|
| TASK-007 | Triage QUEUE/pending items | — | Achieve inbox zero |
| TASK-008 | Review CONTENT_PROCESSING_QUEUE.md | PROJ-001 | Check for untracked items |
| TASK-009 | Review YOUTUBE_PROCESSING_BACKLOG.md | PROJ-001 | Validate channel list |

---

## Inbox Zero Status

- **Current pending items**: 2
- **After triage**: 0 (target achieved)
- **Actions executed**: See below

---

## Recommendations

1. **Execute inbox zero**: Move operational_engine.md to OPERATIONAL/, delete the .NOTE file
2. **Preserve modal2 parking**: These files are correctly positioned for future activation
3. **Connect modal1 to daily work**: Use YOUTUBE_PROCESSING_BACKLOG.md tier structure when selecting transcripts to process
4. **Consider AI_ECOSYSTEM_SURVEY timing**: May be valuable to activate earlier for tooling research even before IIC is complete
