---

### Systems Lenses (10-14)

#### 10. Systems Thinking
**Question**: Are second-order effects considered?
**Evaluation**:
- ✓ Dependencies mapped
- ✓ Feedback loops identified
- ✓ Unintended consequences anticipated
- ✗ Isolated thinking
- ✗ Ignores ripple effects

#### 11. Lean
**Question**: Does this eliminate waste?
**Evaluation**:
- ✓ Minimal viable solution
- ✓ No redundant work
- ✓ Flow optimized
- ✗ Over-engineering
- ✗ Duplicate effort

#### 12. Six Sigma
**Question**: Does this reduce defects?
**Evaluation**:
- ✓ Error rates decrease
- ✓ Quality improves
- ✓ Consistency increases
- ✗ Introduces new failure modes
- ✗ Quality degradation

#### 13. Kaizen
**Question**: Does this enable continuous improvement?
**Evaluation**:
- ✓ Learnings captured
- ✓ Feedback loops established
- ✓ Iteration supported
- ✗ One-time fix
- ✗ No improvement mechanism

#### 14. 80/20
**Question**: Is this high-leverage?
**Evaluation**:
- ✓ Small effort, large impact
- ✓ Addresses root cause
- ✗ Large effort, small impact
- ✗ Symptoms not cause

---

### Foundational Lenses (15-18)

#### 15. Occam's Razor
**Question**: Is this the simplest solution?
**Evaluation**:
- ✓ Minimal complexity
- ✓ Fewest moving parts
- ✗ Unnecessary complexity
- ✗ Over-architected

#### 16. First Principles
**Question**: Is this derived from fundamentals?
**Evaluation**:
- ✓ Based on core truths
- ✓ Not assumption-dependent
- ✗ Based on conventions
- ✗ Cargo-culting

#### 17. Inversion
**Question**: What would make this fail?
**Evaluation**:
- ✓ Failure modes identified
- ✓ Mitigations in place
- ✗ Failure modes ignored
- ✗ Brittle to edge cases

#### 18. Regret Minimization
**Question**: Will this be regretted?
**Evaluation**:
- ✓ Reversible if wrong
- ✓ Low downside risk
- ✓ Optionality preserved
- ✗ Irreversible damage
- ✗ High regret potential

## APPLICATION METHODOLOGY

### Decision Scoring

Score each lens: ✓ (pass) or ✗ (fail)

**Thresholds**:
- 18/18: Exemplary — proceed immediately
- 15-17/18: Good — proceed with noted caveats
- 12-14/18: Acceptable — address failing lenses if possible
- 9-11/18: Marginal — reconsider approach
- <9/18: Reject — fundamental issues

### Worked Example: DIRECTIVE-025 Documentation Decision

**Decision**: Retroactive + prospective comprehensive documentation

| Lens | Score | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1. Syncrescendent Route | ✓ | Restores continuity |
| 2. Bitter Lesson | ✓ | Documentation scales |
| 3. Antifragile | ✓ | Gains from chaos (more decisions = more learnings) |
| 4. Meet the Moment | ✓ | Claudes need visibility NOW |
| 5. Steelman/Redteam | ✓ | Three alternatives evaluated |
| 6. Personal Idiosyncrasies | ✓ | Provides holistic context |
| 7. Potency w/o Resolution Loss | ✓ | Maximum resolution preserved |
| 8. Agentify | ✓ | Structured for model consumption |
| 9. Human-Navigable | ✓ | Clear organization |
| 10. Systems Thinking | ✓ | Documentation IS visibility mechanism |
| 11. Lean | ✓ | Eliminates rework from lost context |
| 12. Six Sigma | ✓ | Reduces defects (no more fictional claims) |
| 13. Kaizen | ✓ | Living documents enable iteration |
| 14. 80/20 | ✓ | High leverage — unlocks all future work |
| 15. Occam's Razor | ✓ | Documentation is simplest solution |
| 16. First Principles | ✓ | Context persistence is fundamental |
| 17. Inversion | ✓ | Failure mode (lost context) already occurred |
| 18. Regret Minimization | ✓ | More documentation never regretted |

**Score**: 18/18 — APPROVED

## LENS CATEGORIES FOR QUICK REFERENCE

### Must-Pass Lenses
These should rarely fail:
- Syncrescendent Route (mission alignment)
- Meet the Moment (current relevance)
- Regret Minimization (reversibility)

### Trade-Off Lenses
These may trade against each other:
- Agentify vs Human-Navigable (balance needed)
- Lean vs Potency (simplicity vs completeness)
- 80/20 vs Systems Thinking (quick wins vs holistic)

### Quality Lenses
These indicate thoroughness:
- Steelman/Redteam (analysis quality)
- Inversion (failure mode analysis)
- First Principles (foundational reasoning)

## USAGE IN ORACLE DECISIONS

When documenting a decision in ORACLE_DECISIONS.md:

1. **State the decision** clearly
2. **List alternatives** considered (Steelman/Redteam)
3. **Score against lenses** (at least the failing ones)
4. **Document rationale** for each relevant lens
5. **Note any trade-offs** accepted
