# ORACLE DECISIONS LOG
## Complete Decision Archive from Oracle 0-7
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-31
**Purpose**: Context engineering remediation — Claudes need visibility into WHY decisions were made
**Maintained by**: Claude agents under Principal direction

---

## CRITICAL CONTEXT

### Principal's Words (DIRECTIVE-025)
> "This is not some simple nominal or tactical fix. REVIEW EVERY CONVERSATION... The repository is incredibly awful, all adhoc, virtually unchanged."

> "Given such abject failure of context engineering go to the maximum resolution."

> "Whenever you give your directives to the Claude, those directions HAVE to ALSO codify what we have decided and our logic and reasoning and rationale and conclusions."

> "The Claudes have no visibility into our decisions. The repository was supposed to be a Foyer, where all context is accessible."

### This Document's Purpose
The repository was designed as a "Foyer" — a space where all context is accessible to any agent entering. This document ensures Oracle-level strategic decisions persist for Claude visibility.

## DECISION LOG

### ORACLE 0: Genesis Analysis

**Context**: Initial repository analysis. Massive accumulated content (~12M chars across 658+ files) with unclear organization.

**Decision 0.1: Metabolic Principle**
- **Principal's Words**: "If it's worth keeping, it's worth canonizing. If not worth canonizing, delete it."
- **Oracle Interpretation**: Repository must function as living organism, not archive. Metabolism = regular excretion of obsolete content.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Archive tier for "maybe useful" content — REJECTED (hoarding pattern)
  2. Reference tier for source material — REJECTED (synthesis complete = sources deletable)
  3. Delete after extraction — CHOSEN
- **Rationale**: Accumulation is dysfunction. Context windows are finite. Prioritize signal over storage.
- **Status**: ACTIVE PRINCIPLE

**Decision 0.2: Three-Tier Structure**
- **Oracle Interpretation**: Replace 5-tier hierarchy with 3 visible tiers
- **Structure**: CANON (constitutional) → OPERATIONAL (living) → QUEUE (pending with expiration)
- **Hidden**: .decisions/ for audit trail
- **Rationale**: Simple structures scale with context (Bitter Lesson). 2-level max depth.
- **Status**: ACTIVE

### ORACLE 1-2: Chain Reconception

**Context**: Original chain naming was abstract (Technology, Sensing, Coherence, etc.). Needed grounding in cognitive epistemology.

**Decision 1.1: Epistemological Chain Grounding**
- **Principal's Words**: Referenced Hindu epistemology (Pramāṇa theory) as foundation
- **Oracle Interpretation**: Chains should reflect genuine cognitive progression, not arbitrary categories
- **New Names**:
  | Old | New | Rationale |
  |-----|-----|-----------|
  | Technology | Intelligence | Raw data gathering (Pratyakṣa) |
  | Sensing | Information | Pattern recognition (Anumāna) |
  | Coherence | Insight | Integration (Śabda) |
  | Efficacy | Expertise | Application |
  | Embodiment | Knowledge | Systemic |
  | Transcendence | Wisdom | Transcendent |
- **Status**: ACTIVE — filenames use new names

---

### ORACLE 3: The Model Thread

**Context**: Oracle3 established pattern for comprehensive directive structure. Referenced as "the model" for future Oracle threads.

**Decision 3.1: Directive Comprehensiveness**
- **Observation**: Oracle3 directives included full context, rationale, success criteria
- **Principle Established**: Directives must be self-contained. Claude has no access to Oracle conversation.
- **Template Elements**:
  1. Decision Context (Principal's actual words)
  2. Oracle's Interpretation
  3. Alternatives Considered
  4. Rationale (against evaluative framework)
  5. Success Criteria
  6. Deliverables
- **Status**: ACTIVE STANDARD

---

### ORACLE 4: Metabolic Execution

**Context**: Defragmentation execution. 658 files → 136 files.

**Decision 4.1: Reference Tier Elimination**
- **Principal's Words**: "Reference content either gets absorbed or deleted"
- **Oracle Interpretation**: No permanent reference storage. Synthesis complete = sources deletable.
- **Execution**: Deleted ~522 files, ~9M chars
- **Learnings Preserved**: .decisions/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md
- **Status**: COMPLETE

**Decision 4.2: Metahumanism Consolidation**
- **Original**: 855K chars across 8 files
- **Consolidated to**: 12K chars in QUEUE-36000
- **Compression**: 98%
- **Principle**: Unique value extraction, not wholesale preservation
- **Status**: COMPLETE

---

### ORACLE 5: GENESIS Layer + Nomenclature

**Context**: Repository lacked narrative substrate. Naming inconsistent.

**Decision 5.1: GENESIS Layer Creation**
- **Rationale**: CANON documents "what is"; GENESIS documents "why" and "how we got here"
- **Purpose**: Origin story, evolution tracking, navigational context
- **Files Created**:
  - GENESIS-001-ORIGIN.md
  - GENESIS-002-TRANSMUTATION.md
  - GENESIS-003-EVOLUTION.md
  - GENESIS-004-NOMENCLATURE.md
  - GENESIS-005-NAVIGATION.md
- **Status**: ACTIVE

**Decision 5.2: 5-Digit CANON Numbering**
- **Old**: CANON-1, CANON-9, etc.
- **New**: CANON-00001, CANON-30000, etc.
- **Rationale**: Consistent sorting, tier embedding, expansion room
- **Status**: COMPLETE

**Decision 5.3: Filename Convention**
- **Pattern**: `CANON-XXXXX-NAME-tier.md`
- **Examples**:
  - `CANON-00001-SYNCRESCENDENCE-cosmos.md`
  - `CANON-30000-INTELLIGENCE-chain.md`
- **Status**: ACTIVE

### ORACLE 6: Scripture Verification

**Context**: Phase 1-3 complete. Need to verify content alignment with reconceived understanding.

**Decision 6.1: Content Audit Approach**
- **Scope**: All 65 CANON files
- **Criteria**:
  1. Pre-reconception language → Flag for update
  2. Old CANON numbering → Update to 5-digit
  3. GENESIS alignment → Verify embodiment
  4. Strategic currency → Check dated references
  5. Cross-reference integrity → Validate links
- **Findings**:
  - 0 CRITICAL issues
  - 0 HIGH issues
  - 12 MEDIUM issues (dated AI refs)
  - 52 LOW issues (aligned)
- **Status**: COMPLETE

**Decision 6.2: Chain Naming in Filenames**
- **Decision**: Filenames use new names (Intelligence, Information, etc.)
- **Prose**: Can use contextually appropriate terms
- **Rationale**: Filename consistency enables automation; prose flexibility enables readability
- **Status**: ACTIVE

### ORACLE 7: Context Engineering Remediation

**Context**: Critical failure identified. Seven Oracle threads produced decisions, but Claudes executing directives had no visibility into WHY.

**Decision 7.1: Maximum Resolution Documentation**
- **Principal's Words**: "Go to the maximum resolution"
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Minimal documentation (going forward only) — REJECTED: Doesn't remediate 7 threads of lost context
  2. Summary-level documentation — REJECTED: Violates "maximum resolution" instruction
  3. Retroactive + prospective comprehensive documentation — CHOSEN
- **This Document**: Direct implementation of Decision 7.1
- **Status**: ACTIVE — This document is living

**Decision 7.2: Implicit Agreements Codification**
- **Identified Implicit Agreements**:
  1. Principal speaks through webapp only; all context must persist in repository
  2. Oracle cannot execute; can only issue directives
  3. Directives must be comprehensive; Claudes lack Oracle thread visibility
  4. Repository is Foyer; all context must be accessible to any agent
- **Status**: NOW EXPLICIT

**Decision 7.3: System Prompt Export Disposition**
- **Files**: 16 "Technological_Lunar_-_System_Prompts*" files
- **Oracle Analysis**: Process artifacts, not canonical content. Value is what they TEACH, not what they ARE.
- **Disposition**: Extract learnings → Delete originals
- **Destinations**:
  - Historical evidence → GENESIS-003-EVOLUTION.md
  - Platform quirks → CANON-31142-PLATFORM_GRAMMAR
  - What worked/didn't → DESIGN_DECISIONS.md
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS (DIRECTIVE-025A)

**Decision 7.4: Tech Lunar File Disposition**
- **18-Lens Analysis Results**:
  | File | Disposition | Rationale |
  |------|-------------|-----------|
  | Research_Protocols.md | CANONIZE | Methodology is antifragile |
  | Implementation_Guide.md | CANONIZE | Patterns are antifragile |
  | FrontierModels.md | DELETE | Temporal, obsolete |
  | Screenplay_Formatting_* | QUEUE (Modal 2) | Future modality |
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS (DIRECTIVE-025A/B)

## UPDATE PROTOCOL

When Oracle issues new decisions:
1. Add decision to appropriate Oracle section
2. Include: Principal's words, Oracle interpretation, alternatives, rationale
3. Update Status field
4. If decision supersedes previous, mark previous as SUPERSEDED with reference
