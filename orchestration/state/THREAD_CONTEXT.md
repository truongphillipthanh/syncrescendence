## THREAD DETAILS

### Oracle 0: Genesis Analysis
**Date**: ~2025-12-28
**Established**:
- Metabolic principle: "If worth keeping, worth canonizing"
- Three-tier structure: CANON → OPERATIONAL → QUEUE
- No reference tier (synthesis complete = sources deletable)
- Simple structures scale (Bitter Lesson)

**Artifacts**: Initial structure proposal

---

### Oracle 1-2: Chain Reconception
**Date**: ~2025-12-28
**Established**:
- Epistemological grounding via Hindu Pramāṇa theory
- Chain renaming:
  - Technology → Intelligence
  - Sensing → Information
  - Coherence → Insight
  - Efficacy → Expertise
  - Embodiment → Knowledge
  - Transcendence → Wisdom
- Celestial body metaphor (stars, planets, moons, etc.)

**Artifacts**: Chain architecture, celestial hierarchy

---

### Oracle 3: The Model Thread ⭐
**Date**: ~2025-12-29
**Established**:
- **Directive comprehensiveness standard**
- Template elements:
  1. Decision Context (Principal's actual words)
  2. Oracle's Interpretation
  3. Alternatives Considered
  4. Rationale (against evaluative framework)
  5. Success Criteria
  6. Deliverables
- Principle: Directives must be self-contained

**Why "The Model"**: Future Oracle threads reference Oracle3's directive structure as the standard. Any directive that lacks context, rationale, or alternatives is incomplete.

**Artifacts**: DIRECTIVE-017 through DIRECTIVE-019

---

### Oracle 4: Metabolic Execution
**Date**: ~2025-12-29
**Established**:
- Defrag execution: 658 files → 136 files
- Reference tier permanent elimination
- Metahumanism consolidation (855K → 12K)
- Learnings preservation in DESIGN_DECISIONS.md

**Artifacts**: DIRECTIVE-016 execution, defrag results

---

### Oracle 5: GENESIS + Nomenclature
**Date**: ~2025-12-30
**Established**:
- GENESIS layer creation (5 files)
- 5-digit CANON numbering (CANON-00001, CANON-30000, etc.)
- Filename convention: `CANON-XXXXX-NAME-tier.md`
- EXEMPLA layer bootstrapped
- Orchestration infrastructure

**Artifacts**: DIRECTIVE-017, DIRECTIVE-018, DIRECTIVE-019, DIRECTIVE-020

---

### Oracle 6: Scripture Verification
**Date**: ~2025-12-31
**Established**:
- Content audit methodology
- 65 CANON files verified
- Findings: 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH, 12 MEDIUM, 52 LOW
- Chain naming decision: filenames use new names, prose flexible
- Phase 1-3 declared complete

**Artifacts**: DIRECTIVE-021, DIRECTIVE-022, DIRECTIVE-023

---

### Oracle 7: Context Engineering Remediation
**Date**: 2025-12-31
**Established**:
- Critical failure identified: Claudes lack visibility into decisions
- Maximum resolution documentation mandate
- Implicit agreements made explicit
- System prompt export disposition
- Tech Lunar file disposition

**Key Recognition**: Repository = Foyer. All context must be accessible to any agent.

**Artifacts**: DIRECTIVE-024, DIRECTIVE-025A, DIRECTIVE-025B, this documentation

---

## PATTERN RECOGNITION

### The Oracle3 Standard
Any directive that lacks:
- Principal's actual words
- Alternatives considered
- Rationale against framework
- Clear success criteria

...is incomplete and should be enhanced.

### Thread Evolution
```
Oracle 0-2: WHAT should the repository be?
Oracle 3: HOW should we communicate directives?
Oracle 4: EXECUTE the structural vision
Oracle 5: ADD narrative substrate
Oracle 6: VERIFY content alignment
Oracle 7: FIX visibility failure
```

### Cumulative Principles
Each thread added to accumulated wisdom:
1. **Metabolism** (O0): Regular excretion prevents bloat
2. **Epistemological Grounding** (O1-2): Chains reflect cognition
3. **Comprehensiveness** (O3): Directives self-contained
4. **Aggressive Deletion** (O4): Delete > archive
5. **Narrative Context** (O5): GENESIS explains WHY
6. **Verification** (O6): Trust but verify
7. **Maximum Resolution** (O7): Document everything
