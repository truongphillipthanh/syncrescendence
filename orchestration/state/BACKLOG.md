## ACTIVE SPRINT

### In Progress
- None currently

### Ready for Execution
- [ ] CANON-30500: Platform Primitives canonization (42K source)
- [ ] Manifest auto-generation: Update CANON-00002 from frontmatter

### Blocked / Awaiting Decision
- None currently

---

## NEAR-TERM BACKLOG

### Structural Completion
- [x] Full metadata rollout (all 61 CANON files) ← COMPLETE
- [x] Tech Lunar crown jewel (CANON-30400) ← COMPLETE
- [x] Tech Lunar asteroids (CANON-30410-30450) ← COMPLETE
- [ ] Platform primitives (CANON-30500, staged)
- [ ] Manifest auto-generation (CANON-00002 populated from frontmatter)
- [x] Cross-reference validation audit ← COMPLETE

### Documentation
- [ ] Archive scaffolding files (move specs to permanent locations)
- [ ] Update CANON-00000 schema with new documents
- [ ] README updates across tiers

---

## MID-TERM BACKLOG

### Content Annealment (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Internal terminology audit (within document prose)
- [ ] Definition consolidation (single-source definitions)
- [ ] Version reconciliation (all to v2.0.0)
- [ ] Prose coherence pass
- [ ] Dependency graph creation

### IIC Constellation
- [ ] Configure remaining accounts (Acumen, Coherence, Mastery, Transcendence)
- [ ] Cross-IIC coordination patterns
- [ ] Platform-specific prompt refinement

### Exempla Population
- [ ] First case study (real implementation example)
- [ ] First worked example (step-by-step demonstration)

### Content Processing
- [ ] YouTube processing pipeline activation
- [ ] ~80 subscriptions systematic processing
- [ ] Content → CANON integration workflow

---

## LONG-TERM BACKLOG

### Activation Phase
- [ ] Obsidian graph verification
- [ ] Full IIC account configuration
- [ ] Cross-IIC coordination testing
- [ ] Content processing pipeline deployment

### Automation
- [ ] Metadata validation scripts
- [ ] Cross-reference checker
- [ ] Manifest generator from frontmatter
- [ ] Naming convention enforcer

## GOALS

### Immediate Goal
Complete Tech Lunar canonization and maintain Oracle visibility ← ACHIEVED

### Near-Term Goal
Platform primitives (CANON-30500), manifest auto-generation

### Mid-Term Goal
Content annealment (internal coherence, not just structural)

### Long-Term Goal
Operational cognitive system with IIC constellation active and content flowing
