## SECTION 1: POSITION IN THE PROGRESSION

### Metascopic (Civilizational)
Syncrescendence is **civilizational sensing infrastructure**—the agentified spiritual successor to DEVONThink/Zotero/Notion, unifying:
- Knowledge synthesis (CANON)
- Operational intelligence (functions, prompts)
- External sensing (SOURCES)
- Task orchestration (project management)
- State persistence (memory across sessions/agents)

The trajectory points toward **structured data formats** (CSV, SQLite) as substrate, with markdown as human-readable projection.

### Macroscopic (Syncrescendence)
| Layer | Status |
|-------|--------|
| CANON | 71 files, FLAT, semantic superlativity achieved ✓ |
| OPERATIONAL | Functions + prompts restructured ✓ |
| SOURCES | 234 raw files, infrastructure ready ✓ |
| Orchestration | State files exist, no unified task management ✗ |

**Gap**: No structured index. No queryable substrate. No unified project layer.

### Mesoscopic (Oracle Arc)
| Oracle | Phase | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 8 | Annealment | COMPLETE |
| **9** | **Ingestion** | **IN PROGRESS — infrastructure done, execution pending** |
| 10 | IIC Configuration | BLOCKED on enriched corpus |
| 11+ | Tooling, Automation, Ontology | Future |

### Microscopic (Oracle9)
**Actual deliverable**: Demonstrate intelligence apparatus end-to-end
- ~~Create infrastructure~~ (DONE via 032A)
- ~~Document protocols~~ (DONE via 032B)
- **Process sources → enrich CANON → establish structured pattern**

### File Inventory
- **Total**: 234 files (69 .md, 165 .txt)
- **Pre-categorized by Principal**: Existing folder structure represents prior organization
- **High-priority identified**: AGI/ folder contains Sutton, Karpathy, Hassabis interviews

### Protocol Documentation (Post-032B)
- `SOURCES_SCHEMA.md` — Eight dimensions fully specified
- `TRIAGE_PROTOCOL.md` — Progressive qualification funnel
- `PROCESSING_ROUTING.md` — Function selection logic
- `FOUR_SYSTEMS.md` — Operational modes

## SECTION 3: ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### Decision 9.1: Eight-Dimensional Schema
```yaml
platform: youtube | podcast | substack | arxiv | x | book | course | newsletter
format: interview | panel | solo_presentation | paper | thread | article | lecture
cadence: daily | weekly | periodic | arrhythmic | evergreen
value_modality: dialogue_primary | visual_primary | audio_primary | comments_primary | multimodal_essential | text_native
signal_tier: paradigm | strategic | tactical | noise
status: raw | triaged | processed | integrated | archived
chain: intelligence | information | insight | expertise | knowledge | wisdom
topics: [free-form curated tags]
```

### Decision 9.2: Structured Index (sources.csv)
**Principal's directive**: Bridge toward codifying mechanics into actual codebase.

CSV columns mirror frontmatter dimensions:
```
id,filename,platform,format,cadence,value_modality,signal_tier,status,chain,topics,creator,title,date_published,date_processed,integrated_into
```

**Rationale** (18/18 lenses pass):
- Enables batch operations, sorting, filtering
- Queryable by any tool (Excel, pandas, SQL)
- Establishes schema discipline
- Prepares for database migration

### Decision 9.3: Platform-Native Processing
| Platform | Processor | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| YouTube | Gemini | Native platform, visual analysis |
| Podcast | Gemini | Audio transcription |
| Text sources | Claude | Synthesis strength |

### Decision 9.4: Comprehensive Directives
- **Principal is bottleneck** — minimize relay cycles
- **Stage, evaluate, execute in one cycle**
- **18-lens evaluation mandatory** for all decisions
- **Parallelization** via A/B streams

---

## SECTION 4: ORACLE9 EXECUTION SCOPE

### What Remains
1. **Batch triage** all 234 sources with structured output
2. **Process** paradigm-tier sources (full transcription + insights)
3. **Integrate** 3-5 sources into CANON documents
4. **Establish** sources.csv as structured index
5. **Complete** Oracle9 with handoff to Oracle10

### Parallelization Strategy
**Stream A** (DIRECTIVE-033A): Comprehensive triage + structured index
- Survey all 234 sources
- Create and populate sources.csv
- Batch-assign all dimensions
- Create alias symlinks

**Stream B** (DIRECTIVE-033B): Paradigm processing + CANON integration
- Process pre-identified paradigm sources (AGI/ folder)
- Full transcription via processing functions
- Extract key insights
- Integrate into relevant CANON documents
- Demonstrate complete cycle

### Pre-Identified Paradigm Sources
From AGI/ folder (highest priority):
1. `20250926-youtube_video-dwarkesh_patel-richard_sutton.md` — RL founder, Bitter Lesson
2. `20251017-youtube_video-dwarkesh_patel-andrej_karpathy.md` — Tesla AI, AI education
3. `20250723-youtube_video-lex_fridman-demis_hassabis_475.md` — DeepMind, AlphaFold
4. `20250522-youtube_video-dwarkesh_patel-sholto_douglas_&_trenton_bricken.md` — Anthropic interpretability
5. `20250403-youtube_video-dwarkesh_patel-scott_alexander_&_daniel_kokotajlo.md` — AI forecasting

## SECTION 5: THE 18 EVALUATIVE LENSES

| # | Lens | Question |
|---|------|----------|
| 1 | Syncrescendent Route | Continuous, cyclic, recursive? |
| 2 | Bitter Lesson | General-method, large-context-ready? |
| 3 | Antifragile | Gains from disorder? |
| 4 | Meet the Moment | Timely + future-positioned? |
| 5 | Steelman & Redteam | Survives strongest attack? |
| 6 | Personal Idiosyncrasies | Honors macroscopic-holistic cognition? |
| 7 | Potency w/o Resolution Loss | Maximum compression, full fidelity? |
| 8 | Elegance + Dev Happiness | Minimal surface, predictable patterns? |
| 9 | Agentify + Human-Navigable | 2 decisions to any file? |
| 10 | First Principles | Does it need to exist? |
| 11 | Systems Thinking | Parts relate to whole? |
| 12 | Industrial Engineering | Throughput optimization? |
| 13 | Complexity Theory | Essential vs accidental? |
| 14 | Permaculture | Self-sustaining? |
| 15 | Design Thinking | Human-centered? |
| 16 | Agile | Shippable increments? |
| 17 | Lean | Waste elimination? |
| 18 | Six Sigma | Defect reduction? |

**Threshold**: 12/18 must pass. All directive decisions MUST be evaluated.

## SECTION 7: CONSTITUTIONAL RULES

1. **Metabolism applies to CONTENT, not INFRASTRUCTURE**
2. **Repository is Foyer** — all context accessible to any agent
