# Office Physicalization Tranche 01

**Date**: 2026-03-02  
**Status**: completed tranche  
**Purpose**: record the first live physicalization of office law inside the successor shell

## What Changed

The successor shell now has a lawful office lane:

- [offices](/Users/system/syncrescendence/offices)

It also now has explicit executive sublanes preserving the old `-SOVEREIGN` functions without reviving its topology:

- [executive/briefings](/Users/system/syncrescendence/executive/briefings)
- [executive/escalations](/Users/system/syncrescendence/executive/escalations)
- [executive/summits](/Users/system/syncrescendence/executive/summits)

## Offices Instantiated

- [commander](/Users/system/syncrescendence/offices/commander)
- [adjudicator](/Users/system/syncrescendence/offices/adjudicator)
- [ajna](/Users/system/syncrescendence/offices/ajna)
- [cartographer](/Users/system/syncrescendence/offices/cartographer)
- [psyche](/Users/system/syncrescendence/offices/psyche)

Each office now has:

- `inbox/`
- `memory/`
- `scratchpad/`
- `outbox/`
- `platform/`

## Playbook Consequence

The office layer is no longer directory-only.
It now has first office playbooks for:

- Commander
- Adjudicator
- Ajna
- Cartographer
- Psyche

These sit under [playbooks](/Users/system/syncrescendence/playbooks) and formalize office-local native grain.

## Operator Consequence

Office creation is reproducible through:

- [bootstrap_office.py](/Users/system/syncrescendence/operators/bootstrap_office.py)

The sandbox Makefile now exposes:

- `make bootstrap-office NAME=office-name`

## Why This Matters

This tranche preserves one of the strongest parts of the pre-syncrephoenix shell:

- real local offices
- local memory and scratch space
- local staging before federal promotion

without preserving what made that shell decay:

- dashed topologies
- duplicate global logistics
- hidden canonical memory
- response graveyards

## Verification

- [OFFICE-LAW-v1.md](/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/state/impl/OFFICE-LAW-v1.md)
- [OFFICES-LAYOUT-v1.md](/Users/system/syncrescendence/orchestration/state/impl/OFFICES-LAYOUT-v1.md)
- `make check-artifact-law`
