# CC76 CLI/Web Gap Follow-Up Assessment

**Date**: 2026-03-02  
**Purpose**: record what the second Oracle and Perplexity follow-up round actually settled about Cowork, Claude in Chrome, and the first fused relay implementation path

## Landed Artifacts

- [RESPONSE-ORACLE-cc76-cli-web-gap-followup.md](/Users/system/syncrescendence/communications/responses/RESPONSE-ORACLE-cc76-cli-web-gap-followup.md)
- [RESPONSE-PERPLEXITY-cc76-cli-web-gap-followup.md](/Users/system/syncrescendence/communications/responses/RESPONSE-PERPLEXITY-cc76-cli-web-gap-followup.md)

Both were bridged into the event ledger and ontology.

## What Is Now Settled

## 1. Cowork + Claude in Chrome is the correct v1 prototype path

This is now the strongest practical recommendation.

Not because it is the final architecture.
Because it is the fastest real path to testing whether the bridge can close on subscription surfaces without writing custom browser infrastructure first.

The follow-up responses converge on:

- use Cowork + Claude in Chrome now for prototype execution
- do not mistake it for the permanent primary execution fabric
- treat custom local browser workers as the likely v2 primary

That is the key decision.

## 2. Cowork is strong enough for folder-based relay

The most important verified point from the Perplexity follow-up is:

- Cowork has real local file access
- folder grounding is officially supported
- folder instructions can act as the persistence contract across sessions

This means a designated folder is a real operational primitive, not a fantasy.

## 3. Claude in Chrome is strong enough for a Perplexity relay prototype now

The Perplexity follow-up provides enough official support to treat this as a valid immediate prototype:

- multi-step browser workflows
- multi-tab work
- repeated workflows
- browser interaction from the Claude ecosystem

So Perplexity is the right first candidate.

## 4. NotebookLM upload remains plausible but not fully ratified

The most important unresolved point is still:

- third-party file uploads via Claude in Chrome are plausible
- but not explicitly documented enough to treat as settled fact

So NotebookLM should be treated as:

- worth prototyping
- not yet the first safe architecture anchor

## 5. Cowork should not become the permanent primary

The Oracle follow-up was strongest on this point.

Cowork is best treated as:

- execution surface
- planning surface
- transitional prototype layer

Not:

- truth plane
- permanent dispatch authority
- long-term replacement for a deterministic local orchestrator

---

## What This Means

The architecture is now effectively phased:

## v1

Use:

- repo packet
- designated local folder
- Cowork grounded in that folder
- Claude in Chrome for the web interaction
- returned artifact written back to disk
- reconciliation into repo/event/ontology

This is the fastest real test of fusion.

## v2

Build:

- local queue/orchestrator
- custom browser-profile workers
- likely Playwright-based or equivalent
- optional MCP wrapping over those workers

This becomes the durable execution plane once the workflow is proven.

---

## Safe Decision-Grade Conclusions

These are safe to act on now:

1. Prototype the bridge with Cowork + Claude in Chrome first.
2. Use a designated folder and one file per job, not a shared document.
3. Start with a Perplexity job type before NotebookLM upload complexity.
4. Preserve repo/event/ontology as truth plane.
5. Treat Cowork as transitional execution, not permanent orchestration.

---

## Immediate Next Build

The next highest-leverage implementation is:

1. create a designated local relay folder
2. define a minimal one-file job format
3. write Cowork folder instructions for processing the inbox
4. run a Perplexity round-trip test
5. only then decide whether NotebookLM upload should be the second prototype

That is now a falsifiable build sequence rather than a conceptual discussion.

## Live Prototype Result

On 2026-03-02, the first live Perplexity round-trip succeeded through the v1 relay:

- Cowork was grounded to `orchestration/relay/cowork-v1`
- Claude in Chrome submitted the staged Perplexity packet
- Cowork wrote the returned markdown and status JSON into the relay folder
- Hazel detected the status file and ran the finalization script
- the response landed back in repo truth and projected through the existing event/ontology path

This does not prove the final architecture.
It does prove the core v1 claim:

- a designated local folder
- Cowork execution
- Claude in Chrome browser control
- Hazel edge triggering
- repo/event/ontology normalization

is already strong enough to close the loop for a real subscription-surface relay.

The remaining work is now about hardening and generalizing the pattern, not guessing whether the pattern exists.
