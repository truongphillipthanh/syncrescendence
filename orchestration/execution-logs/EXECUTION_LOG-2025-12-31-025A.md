# EXECUTION LOG: DIRECTIVE-025A
## Documentation & Extraction Stream
**Date**: 2025-12-31
**Agent**: Claude 2 (Desktop)
**Directive**: DIRECTIVE-025A
**Parallel Stream**: Claude 3 handles DIRECTIVE-025B (Structural Execution)

## DIRECTIVE CONTEXT

### Principal's Words (Quoted from Oracle7)
> "This is not some simple nominal or tactical fix. REVIEW EVERY CONVERSATION..."

> "Given such abject failure of context engineering go to the maximum resolution."

> "The Claudes have no visibility into our decisions. The repository was supposed to be a Foyer, where all context is accessible."

### Oracle's Interpretation
Seven Oracle threads produced strategic decisions, but context engineering failed catastrophically. This directive establishes maximum-resolution documentation to remediate the visibility failure.

## Phase A: Documentation Infrastructure

### A1: Core Files Installed

| File | Location | Size | Status |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| ORACLE_DECISIONS.md | `orchestration/state/` | ~8K | ✓ CREATED |
| THREAD_CONTEXT.md | `orchestration/state/` | ~4K | ✓ CREATED |
| STANDARDS.md | `orchestration/state/` | ~6K | ✓ CREATED |

**Notes**: All three core documentation files created with comprehensive content covering:
- Complete decision log from Oracle 0-7
- Thread summary and pattern recognition
- 18-lens evaluative framework with methodology

**Phase A Status**: ✓ COMPLETE

---

## Phase B: System Prompt Extraction

### B1: Audit Findings

**Raw Exports Examined**: 14 files across 4 platforms

| Platform | Files | Total Size | Unique Value Found |
|----------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| ChatGPT | 6 | ~16K | Author profile, behavioral traits |
| Claude | 2 | ~4K | Persona specifications |
| Gemini | 4 | ~4K | 4-slot architecture pattern |
| Grok | 2 | ~4K | Instruments framework |

**Key Finding**: "Archetype Engineering" era documented — detailed persona specifications per platform that have been superseded by "Reception Calibration" approach.

### B2: Extractions Made

| Content | Destination | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Archetype Engineering pattern | DESIGN_DECISIONS.md | Historical learning |
| Platform-specific → Unified evolution | DESIGN_DECISIONS.md | Architecture decision |
| Memory accumulation lessons | DESIGN_DECISIONS.md | Pattern identification |
| 4-slot separation lessons | DESIGN_DECISIONS.md | Platform constraint ≠ info architecture |
| Aesthetic vs Analytical tension | DESIGN_DECISIONS.md | Feature, not bug |
| Instruments framework | DESIGN_DECISIONS.md | Evocative, worth preserving |

**DESIGN_DECISIONS.md created**: ~5K characters of extracted learnings

### B3: Verification

**File**: `orchestration/state/SYSTEM_PROMPT_EXTRACTION_VERIFICATION.md`

### B4: Deletion Manifest

**Files marked for deletion**: 15
- System prompt exports: 14
- Tech Lunar temporal file: 1 (FrontierModels.md)

**Awaiting Principal approval**: ✓

**File**: `orchestration/state/DELETION_MANIFEST.md`

**Phase B Status**: ✓ COMPLETE

## Phase C: Tech Lunar Prep

### C1: Research_Protocols

| Criterion | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Canonization prep file created | ✓ |
| Proposed ID | CANON-30330-RESEARCH_PROTOCOLS-asteroid-TECH_STACK-comet-INTELLIGENCE.md |
| Current size | ~31K |
| Target size | ~20K (~35% compression) |

**Key Sections to Preserve**:
- Source Triad Method
- Decision-bearing questions
- Verdicting process
- Anti-patterns
- Infrastructure/Tool evaluation patterns

**File**: `orchestration/state/CANONIZATION_PREP_Research_Protocols.md`

### C2: Implementation_Guide

| Criterion | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Canonization prep file created | ✓ |
| Proposed ID | CANON-30340-IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERNS-asteroid-TECH_STACK-comet-INTELLIGENCE.md |
| Current size | ~43K |
| Target size | ~25K (~42% compression) |

**Key Sections to Preserve**:
- Architectural Wisdom (over-engineering lessons)
- Memory System Bootstrapping (5 phases)
- Orchestration Patterns (decision tree + 5 patterns)
- Context Engineering Economics (RAG, caching)
- Security and Governance (threat model, defenses)
- Bootstrap Roadmap (12-month timeline)

**File**: `orchestration/state/CANONIZATION_PREP_Implementation_Guide.md`

### C3: Screenplay_Formatting

| Criterion | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Queue prep file created | ✓ |
| Current files | 5 files (~76K total) |
| Consolidated to | 1 QUEUE item |
| Proposed ID | QUEUE-36200-SCREENPLAY_ORCHESTRATION-Modal2.md |
| Target size | ~30K (~60% reduction) |
| Expiration | 2 cycles from Modal 2 activation |

**File**: `orchestration/state/QUEUE_PREP_Screenplay_Formatting.md`

### C4: FrontierModels

| Criterion | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Unique value found | NO |
| Historical value for GENESIS | NO (point-in-time snapshot) |
| Methodology worth preserving | NO |
| Added to deletion manifest | ✓ |

**Rationale**: October 2025 AI model landscape analysis. Temporal content, already obsolete. No enduring methodology. No historical value for GENESIS (doesn't document our evolution).

**Phase C Status**: ✓ COMPLETE
