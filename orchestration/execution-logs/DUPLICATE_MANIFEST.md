## Category 4: System Files (.DS_Store)

All .DS_Store files should be deleted. They are macOS metadata files that should not be tracked in git. The `.gitignore` already excludes them but they were committed previously.

## Old Naming Convention Files (cosmos/chain/lattice/core/meta)

**Note**: The prior commit (`8ad0dc6`) already deleted all old naming convention files from `9-Canon/`. No additional files with old naming patterns (`CANON-*-cosmos-*`, `CANON-*-chain-*`, `CANON-*-lattice-*`, `CANON-*-core-*`, `CANON-*-meta-*`) exist in the current repository.

## Execution Commands for Claude 3 (Phase C & D)

### Delete Backup Files
```bash
find . -name "*.backup" -delete
```

### Delete Double Extension Files
```bash
find . -name "*.txt.txt" -delete
```

### Delete .DS_Store Files
```bash
find . -name ".DS_Store" -delete
```

### Rename Legacy Files (Manual Review Required)
The `Technology Lunar*` files contain unique content and should be renamed to follow the new naming convention. Suggested format:
- `TECH-XXXX-<DOMAIN>-<NAME>.md`
