## Overview

The Sovereignty Strata define eight concentric layers of system sovereignty, from the irreducible human center (σ₀) to the outermost execution substrate (σ₇). Engineering priority flows **outside-in**: if the execution substrate doesn't work, nothing upstream matters.

These are distinct from the Celestial Cosmology's Transcendence Ring (τ-chain), which addresses orbital position in the SN hierarchy rather than operational sovereignty.

## The Eight Strata

| Layer | Name | Function |
|-------|------|----------|
| **σ₀** | **Sovereign** | The human. Biological substrate. Attention as bottleneck. Constitutional authority. Cannot be delegated. |
| **σ₁** | **Teleology** | Why we act. Intentions, objectives, destinations. The Compass. Intention Archaeology. Modal Sequence. |
| **σ₂** | **Architecture** | How we structure. CANON, cosmology, ontological frameworks. The Schema (CANON-00000). Six Dimensions. Chain Matrix. |
| **σ₃** | **Context Engineering** | What each instance knows. Memory architecture, project files, context transitions, handoff protocols. |
| **σ₄** | **Ground Truth** | Where truth lives. Git repository. Ledgers. State files. "Repository is truth; web apps are cache." |
| **σ₅** | **Intelligence Substrate** | Who does the thinking. Platforms, models, capabilities. Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Grok, Perplexity. |
| **σ₆** | **Access Layer** | How we authenticate. Accounts, entitlements, API keys. Account 1/2/3, OAuth, rate limits. |
| **σ₇** | **Execution Substrate** | What actually runs. CLIs, tools, automations, pipelines. Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Skills, MCP, Hooks. The neo-dev explosion lives here. |

## Principles

### The σ₇-First Principle
Engineering priority flows outside-in. If σ₇ (execution) doesn't work, nothing upstream matters. Build from execution substrate toward teleology.

### Sovereignty Gradient
Authority concentrates at center (σ₀) and diffuses outward. σ₀ decisions override all other layers. Outer layers serve inner layers, never the reverse.

### Layer Independence
Each stratum can be modified without disrupting adjacent strata, provided interfaces are preserved. Replacing a tool at σ₇ shouldn't require architectural changes at σ₂.

## Relationship to Celestial Cosmology

The Sovereignty Strata (σ) and the Celestial Cosmology (SN hierarchy) are **orthogonal systems**:

- **Sovereignty Strata**: Operational layers of system control (WHO has authority over WHAT)
- **Celestial Cosmology**: Knowledge organization hierarchy (HOW content relates to content)

The τ-chain (Transcendence/Wisdom) in the Celestial Cosmology maps to σ₁ (Teleology) in spirit, but they are not equivalent. One organizes knowledge; the other organizes authority.
