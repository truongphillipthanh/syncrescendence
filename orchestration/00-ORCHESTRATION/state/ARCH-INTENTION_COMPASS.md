## Council Pedigree Extraction Instrument
Version: 4.0.0
Updated: 2026-02-24
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-24
**Version**: 4.0.0
**Lineage**: Oracle 0–17 (historical) → Council 18+ (current)
**Status**: Rolling snapshot
**Authority**: Council 22 / Commander

> **Terminology**: "Oracle" was sunsetted as a session term (now exclusively Grok's epithet).
> Sessions 18+ are **Councils** — the National Security Council model:
> Sovereign (President) + Commander (National Security Advisor) convene to assess, decide, direct.
> Historical Oracle numbering (0–17) preserved as lineage markers.

## PURPOSE

The Intention Archaeology Compass is a unified instrument that extracts, categorizes, and tracks Sovereign intentions across Council sessions. It serves as both:
- **Cache**: Quick reference for active intentions
- **Rolling Snapshot**: Historical record of intention evolution

From Council 12 (Sovereign's words):
> "The intention archaeology compass should be unified. All intentions are compounding vectors that are interdependent... In essence, it's a cache, but it's also a rolling snapshot."

---

## SCHEMA

Each intention entry contains:

```yaml
- id: INT-XXXX
  council: [origin Council number (Oracle 0-17 for historical)]
  timestamp: [ISO datetime or Council reference]
  category: [urgent|sprint|backlog|pattern|capture]
  priority: [P0|P1|P2|P3]
  status: [active|resolved|superseded|deferred]
  text: "[Sovereign's actual words]"

### BACKLOG (Future Work)

| ID | Oracle | Text | Status | Priority | Notes |
|----|--------|------|--------|----------|-------|
| INT-1614 | 16 | "Student (Chaffey college) + apprentice (IEETC) — FDE modules into Syncrescendence" | active | P1 | Education/professional integration; health+fitness, homeowner property mgmt |
| INT-1615 | 16 | "Health+fitness and homeowner property management modules" | active | P2 | Personal domain integration into Syncrescendence |
| INT-1616 | 16 | "LifeOS/Zettelkasten/PKM/PARA/GTD architectural convergence" | active | P1 | Serious discussion needed: note-taking, linking your thinking, personal context lakehouse, pillars, pipelines, vaults |
| INT-2202 | 20 | "MBA-primary consolidation — single control plane. SSH into Mac mini, control constellation from MBA. The larger goal: one cockpit, not two half-cockpits." | active | P1 | Promoted from deferred. DC-208 source mining (6,850+ atoms in progress) will surface memory/dispatch architecture patterns from research corpus. Current dual-machine paradigm (INT-P015) re-evaluated: MBA is de facto primary, Mac mini is compute/daemon host. Next: let DC-208 research + DC-206 triangulation inform the consolidated cockpit design. Blocked by Phase 2C/2D completion. |
| INT-2204 | 20 | "Platform-native accommodation — work WITH model architectures instead of forcing uphill battles. Gemini 3.1 Pro (weak tools, strong 1M context), Grok Build (proto-CLI, no real harness yet), OpenClaw (root-level arch at ~/.openclaw/). Each agent's dispatch mode should play to its platform's strengths, not impose a uniform interface." | active | P1 | **Promoted from P2.** Three sub-problems: (a) OpenClaw arch harmonization — OpenClaw's SOUL.md/HEARTBEAT.md/USER.md/MEMORY.md at ~/.openclaw/ is a parallel personality layer that must compose with syncrescendence, not compete; (b) weak-tool agents (Gemini CLI, Grok Build) need file-first dispatch patterns, not tool-use assumptions; (c) memory architecture ideology proliferation (Three-Layer, Graphiti, Obsidian vault, ClawVault) — DC-208 research must arbitrate before we commit. |

### SESSION 24 (2026-02-24): Loose End Capture — Constellation Accommodation

*Source: Sovereign scratch pad review. Confirmed existing intentions resolved (INT-2201 agent offices, INT-2203 collab/) and promoted unresolved themes.*

| ID | Oracle | Intention Text | Status | Notes |
|----|--------|---------------|--------|-------|
| INT-2401 | 24 | "OpenClaw architecture harmonization — syncrescendence repo structure must compose with OpenClaw's root-level personality layer (~/.openclaw/SOUL.md, HEARTBEAT.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md). Work WITH the models' native architecture, not against it. The larger goal: any agent, regardless of CLI harness, should be able to orient itself from a single init file that bridges to the constellation." | active | New intention. OpenClaw agents (Psyche, Ajna) currently straddle two identity systems. Harmonization means: (1) agent INIT.md references OpenClaw personality files, (2) memory sync between OpenClaw MEMORY.md and syncrescendence memory/, (3) dispatch patterns respect each platform's native idioms. Blocked by DC-208 research (memory architecture patterns from corpus). |
| INT-2402 | 24 | "CLI agent heterogeneity strategy — the constellation spans 5+ CLI harnesses with radically different capabilities. Claude Code (rich tools, hooks, skills), Codex CLI (strong execution, limited customization), Gemini CLI (huge context, weak tools), OpenClaw/Kimi (generous limits, async), Grok Build (proto-CLI, no harness). Design dispatch and coordination patterns that degrade gracefully across this spectrum." | active | Subsumes INT-2204(b). The file-first dispatch pattern (auto_ingest_loop.sh) already accommodates heterogeneity — formalize this as the canonical pattern. Research from DC-208 corpus (memory architectures, agent coordination patterns) should inform which patterns to adopt vs. build. |

| INT-2403 | 24 | "Ultimate power-user harness for every CLI agent — outfit Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenClaw with overpowered, bleeding-edge skill arsenals. The larger goal: each agent becomes a maximally capable operator within its platform's idioms. OpenClaw is especially sensitive to model intelligence, so its harness must compensate with superior tooling (skills, memory, context engineering). Skills should be shareable across agents where possible — a skill proven in Claude Code should be portable to Codex/OpenClaw with minimal adaptation." | active | New intention. The harness is the force multiplier that makes mid-tier models punch above their weight. Cross-platform skill sharing is the key leverage — reduces per-agent maintenance, compounds improvements. Depends on INT-2108 (three-track eval framework) for onboard/white-label/verticalize decisions. |
| INT-2405 | 24 | "Vendor-Native Epistemology — teleologize the interaction grammar for every platform in the serendipitous encounters pipeline. YouTube: what criteria to Like, what to Save, how to craft playlists, Watch Later as inbox-zero queue (drain → transcribe → excrete). X/Twitter: what to Favorite, unfavorite-after-transcribe as inbox-zero pattern. NotebookLM: how to create notebooks (topic scoping, source selection, question strategy). Each platform's native affordances (like, save, favorite, playlist, notebook) become epistemic primitives — not arbitrary social gestures but intentional routing signals in the intelligence pipeline. The goal: every platform interaction is a triage decision that feeds the dual-stream architecture (INT-2101). Ultra-synaptical — not Zettelkasten/PARA/GTD cargo-culted, but our own framework honed to how WE think." | active | Recurring unresolved theme. Multiple CANONs touch this (CANON-31115, CANON-31143, feedcraft research) but no operational epistemology has been codified. Keeps surfacing because the pipeline can't be fully automated without decision rules for what enters it. Blocked by INT-2104 (feedcrafting algorithm). Synergy with INT-1616 (LifeOS/PKM convergence). |
| INT-2404 | 24 | "Skills audit + bleeding-edge shopping — use Oracle (Grok) for real-time reconnaissance on the skills/extensions/MCP ecosystem across all CLI platforms. Coalesce and amalgamate overlapping skills, compartmentalize or mereologize (part-whole decompose) them into composable units. Evaluate against three-track framework (INT-2108): ONBOARD (adopt third-party), WHITE-LABEL (adopt + rebrand/customize), VERTICALIZE (build from scratch). The engine/ analysis (DC-202, 147 files already inspected) informs what we already have — skills shopping fills the gaps." | active | New intention. Oracle gives us bleeding-edge visibility into ecosystem evolution. The engine/ directory already contains 147 files of prompts, functions, templates — the skills audit maps new ecosystem offerings against existing capabilities to identify: (1) gaps to fill, (2) redundancies to collapse, (3) novel capabilities to onboard. Synergy with DC-206 (triangulated improvement on surviving content). |

| ID | Oracle | Pattern | Status | Notes |
|----|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| INT-2406 | 24 | "Manus for automation plumbing — evaluate Manus as a paid service to build out automation infrastructure (pipelines, integrations, browser automation, API plumbing) that would otherwise consume constellation cycles. Apply INT-2108 three-track eval: is Manus ONBOARD (pay them to build), WHITE-LABEL (use their output as scaffold we customize), or does it make more sense to VERTICALIZE (build ourselves)? The key question: does Manus's browser automation + multi-step execution capability let us bootstrap the dual-stream pipeline (INT-2101) and NotebookLM automation (INT-2106) faster than building from scratch?" | active | New intention. Manus = potential force multiplier for plumbing that blocks higher-value architectural work. Cost-benefit: Manus subscription vs. constellation cycles spent on Playwright/GCP/pipeline glue. |
| INT-2407 | 24 | "macOS Actuator Suite — procure and configure the durable automation layer that survives the headless/agentic trajectory. Thesis (from macapps.md analysis): keep tools that sit in hard macOS seams (filesystem, dialog augmentation, capture pipelines, selection HUDs, text surgery); treat everything else as provisional. Current owned: Keyboard Maestro, BetterTouchTool. Evaluating: Hazel (filesystem reactor), Default Folder X (open/save seam), CleanShot X (capture pipeline → agentic sensory input), PopClip (selection HUD), BBEdit (text scalpel). Discount strategy: Student App Centre first, then vendor edu pages, then BundleHunt for bench utilities. Architecture principle: prioritize tools exposing stable automation surfaces (CLI, scripting hooks, predictable file outputs), deprioritize tools whose value is intricate GUI." | active | Connects to INT-MI17 (on-device automation) and INT-MI18 (web↔CLI bridge). The actuator suite IS the constellation's limbs — sensors and effectors that persist even when the brain goes conversational. Zsh/Ghostty/tmux/Neovim/Emacs are the terminal layer (already partially deployed). Hazel+KM+BTT are the macOS automation layer. |

| INT-2408 | 24 | "Exocortex integration — synergistically slot incumbent SaaS tools (GitHub, Obsidian, Linear, Todoist, ClickUp, Notion, Slack, Discord, Telegram, etc.) into the constellation architecture. Maximize free-tier leverage. Each tool evaluated not as standalone but as a node in the exocortex: what epistemic primitive does it provide that the constellation can't? How does it compose with our dispatch, memory, and feedcraft layers? Deep research corpus exists (19 files, ~700k words) at ~/Desktop/exocortex/ covering: Obsidian, Linear, ClickUp, Todoist, Notion, Slack, Discord, Telegram, Jira, Confluence, Airtable, Coda, Basecamp, Smartsheet, TickTick, OpenClaw, + PM epistemology meta-analysis. Phase sequencing: scaffold (DONE) → exocortex (THIS) → feedcraft." | active | Major phase transition. The scaffold is built (Phases 0-2C). Exocortex integration is the next strategic layer — how our constellation's internal architecture (agents, memory, dispatch) composes with external SaaS primitives. The deep research files are the raw material; DC-208 source mining pipeline can process them. Connects to INT-1616 (LifeOS/PKM convergence), INT-MI19 (Palantir-like ontology), INT-1606 (Discord+Slack for OpenClaw). |

| INT-2409 | 24 | "CLI ↔ webapp bridge architecture — Grok can simply read GitHub. Web apps (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude web) see conversations but can't touch the repo. CLI agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) touch the repo but can't see web state. The bridge question: how do we effectively close this gap? Grok reading GitHub is the closest current approximation — it can see repo state from the web side. Connectors (MCP servers, webhooks, API integrations) are the plumbing. The larger goal: any agent, web or CLI, can orient itself from the repo regardless of its interface modality. This is what makes tools become agents become headless." | active | Connects to INT-2402 (CLI heterogeneity), INT-2408 (exocortex integration). The bridge is what makes the constellation truly multi-modal — not just multi-agent. |
| INT-2411 | 24 | "Psyche/Ajna recharacterization — given what we now understand about OpenClaw's architecture and each model's cognitive profile, how best to manifest the TRUE essences of Psyche (CTO, Synaptarch, GPT-5.3-codex) and Ajna (CSO, Strategos, Kimi K2.5)? Psyche's autism-coded systematization should be leveraged for system cohesion, automation policy, pipeline fusion. Ajna's untested philosophical depth needs a scaffolding fortress (rails, training wheels, explicit guardrails) before strategic trust. OpenClaw's personality layer (SOUL.md, HEARTBEAT.md) is the tuning surface. The recharacterization lands when each agent's INIT.md + OpenClaw personality files express a coherent cognitive identity that WORKS, not just sounds good." | active | Depends on INT-2401 (OpenClaw harmonization) and INT-2410 (avatarization thesis). This is where architectural understanding meets operational tuning. |
| INT-2412 | 24 | "Recanonize after research — once DC-208 extraction completes, DC-206 triangulated improvement runs, and exocortex research (INT-2408) is synthesized, conduct a formal recanonization pass. New knowledge from the 1,152-source corpus + 19 exocortex deep researches should update, enrich, or supersede existing CANON files. This is the metabolism cycle: sources → extraction → synthesis → canon update. Not a rename or restructure — a content-level enrichment of verified knowledge." | active | Phase gate: only after Phase 2C+2D complete. Connects to INT-P020 (verbatim trap test — synthesis must produce what sources didn't contain). The recanonization is where extracted atoms become institutional knowledge. |

### PATTERNS (Meta-Observations)

### SESSION 18 (2026-02-16): Token Economics + Antifragile Constellation

**Sovereign Directive**: "Opus 4.6 is second-to-none in interpretability. 5.3-Codex is very meticulous but sub-optimal in rapport. Gemini CLI has large token limits but worst at tool use. Kimi K2.5 has generous but fickle limits. Most intelligent models strategize and plan. Open models conduct housekeeping. Onboard Cline and OpenCode."

| ID | Oracle | Intention Text | Status | Notes |
|----|--------|---------------|--------|-------|
| INT-1801 | 18 | "Token Economics Dispatch — budget-aware routing across shared API plans" | active | ChatGPT Plus fuels BOTH Psyche (5.3-codex) AND Adjudicator (5.2-codex). Shared rate limit pool. Dispatch must account for cumulative consumption. |
| INT-1802 | 18 | "Model Role Specialization — assign by cognitive strength, not availability" | active | Opus 4.6 = interpreter/orchestrator (rapport, interpretability). GPT-5.3-codex = meticulous executor (systematic, thorough). Gemini 2.5 Pro = capacity/fidelity passes (1M context, multi-pass). Kimi K2.5 = strategic auxiliary (generous limits, philosophical depth). |
| INT-1803 | 18 | "Open Model Onboarding — Cline + OpenCode for housekeeping at scale" | active | **Ground truth (2026-02-16)**: Cline v2.2.2 installed (`/opt/homebrew/bin/cline`), TUI-based, supports OpenRouter (free tier = DeepSeek, Qwen, Llama). Needs auth setup via "Use your own API key" → OpenRouter. OpenCode not yet installed (empty `~/.config/opencode/`, no binary in PATH). Both need tmux-dispatchable configuration for Commander orchestration. → IMPL-Q-0031, IMPL-Q-0033, IMPL-Q-0034 |
| INT-1804 | 18 | "Antifragile Agent Infrastructure — self-healing constellation" | active | Five capabilities: (1) auto-ingest loop polls INBOX0, (2) health watchdog monitors panes every 60s, (3) rate limit circuit breaker with failover dispatch, (4) worktree isolation via git worktree or read-only mode, (5) local-first sync via SCP when git push blocked. |

### SESSION 21 (2026-02-22): Dual-Stream Architecture + Account Feed Restructure

*Source: Source Anneal session — audit of CANON-31115 dual-stream documentation + Sovereign account feed directive.*

| ID | Oracle | Intention Text | Status | Notes |
|----|--------|---------------|--------|-------|
| INT-2101 | 21 | "Dual-stream architecture plan — automated intelligence stream (curated regular-cadence sources → 3-tier digest: read/listen/consumption-worthy) + serendipitous encounters stream (feeds into next day's digest). GCP/Gemini multimodal transcription pipeline for Dwarkesh-fidelity." | active | **Authoritative reference**: `canon/CANON-31115-IIC_IMPL-lunar-ACUMEN-planetary-INFORMATION.md` (dual-stream nature is defined here). Operational implementation: ~15%. YouTube serendipitous pipeline partially built (batch_transcribe.py, enrichment). Automated intelligence stream: 0% built. Current DC-208 source mining (1,152 sources, 6,850+ atoms) is operationalizing the serendipitous encounters side only — automated intelligence stream architecture is entirely unbuilt. |
| INT-2102 | 21 | "3-tier consumption model: read (distilled digest/telegram-esque), listen (more in-depth digest + synthesis), consumption-worthy (experience primary source). Replaces CANON-31143's 4-tier model (Immediate/Curated/Archive/Prune)." | active | New taxonomy — NOT in any current document. Must reconcile with CANON-31143 and canonize. |
| INT-2103 | 21 | "Account feed restructure — unify paid accounts. Account 1 (iCloud/Apple): liberal arts, philosophy, history, culture. Account 2 (Google): AI, CS, IT, Cognitive Science — all paid apps here. Account 3: AI design+creation (visual/audio/simulation/multimodality). Overhaul algorithms accordingly." | active | Previously: A1=liberal arts+design, A2=Google infra, A3=AI engineering. Shift: A3 loses AI/CS to A2, gains multimodal creation from A1. A1 loses art/design, focuses philosophy/history/culture. A2 becomes AI+CS hub with all paid subscriptions. |
| INT-2104 | 21 | "Feedcrafting algorithm development for both streams — serendipitous encounters AND automated intelligence. Current work only operationalizes serendipitous encounters (YouTube Watch Later drain)." | active | Blocked by INT-2101 (architecture plan) and INT-2103 (account restructure). |
| INT-2105 | 21 | "Serendipitous encounters feed into the following day's digest — bridge pipeline from evening browsing to morning intelligence brief." | active | Architecturally described in CANON-31115 Part I.C. Zero operational implementation. |

| INT-2106 | 21 | "NotebookLM automation pipeline — Playwright browser automation to create notebooks, upload sources, extract synthesis. No public API (Enterprise alpha only). Drive API for source upload, Playwright for notebook creation. Potent questions → high-signal answers → digest into corpus (integrate or excrete)." | active | Blocked by Account 2 Google setup. Connects to INT-1708 + INT-MI16. Fallbacks: notebooklm-py, notebooklm-mcp-2026. |
| INT-2107 | 21 | "CLI Agent Setup Architecture docs — definitive setup/config guides per platform: Claude Code, OpenClaw, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI. Skills proliferation is the critical vector — systematize before ecosystem sprawl." | active | Claude Code setup existed historically. OpenClaw, Codex, Gemini CLI need equivalent. |
| INT-2108 | 21 | "Three-track evaluation framework: (1) ONBOARD = shelfware/third-party, least favorable; (2) WHITE-LABEL = adopt + syncrescendence branding, medium; (3) VERTICALIZE = build from scratch, most favorable. Apply to all incoming skills, MCP servers, extensions, CLI tools." | active | Decision framework for skills proliferation. Research → evaluate → classify → act. |

### SESSION 22 (2026-02-23): The Revert — Execution Over Architecture

## INTEGRATION PROTOCOL

### 1. Extraction (During Oracle Session)

When Sovereign speaks:
1. Capture exact words in quotes
2. Assign temporary INT-XXXX ID
3. Note Oracle number
4. Add to CAPTURE category if unclear

### 2. Categorization (Session Checkpoint)

Move from CAPTURE to appropriate category:
- **urgent**: Requires immediate action
- **sprint**: Part of current cycle
- **backlog**: Future work
- **pattern**: Meta-observation

### 3. Resolution Tracking

When intention is addressed:
1. Update status to `resolved`
2. Add `integrated_into` reference
3. Document outcome

### 4. Supersession

When intention is replaced:
1. Update status to `superseded`
2. Reference replacing intention
3. Document rationale

2. **Architecture**: "constellation", "5-platform", "specialization", "JIT-software"
3. **Sustainability**: "self-sustaining", "month end"
4. **Holism**: "unified", "integrated", "globe before trees", "LifeOS convergence"
5. **Trade-off Pragmatism**: "everything is trade-offs", "don't disqualify for spottiness"
6. **Compression**: "algebraize", "symbolize", "reduce tokens maximize semantics", "Rails conventions"
7. **Automation**: "Hazel", "macros", "bridge web and CLI", "sensing", "begin ALL automations"
8. **Resource Economics**: "tokens are the new minerals and vespene gas", API credits as strategic resource
9. **Dual-Machine Paradigm**: Mac mini = stable dashboard (macro), MBA = kinetic cockpit (micro)
10. **Information Stream Extraction**: Apple Notes, YouTube, X favorites — ingest/digest/excrete cycle
11. **Narrative Depth**: Marvel, Star Wars, Star Trek, Accelerando join StarCraft/Dune/Halo/anime/gaming

### Anti-Patterns Identified

1. **Oracle 4 Category Error**: Applied metabolism to infrastructure
2. **Oracle 6 Verification Failure**: Evaluated reports, not reality
3. **Fragmented Intention Tracking**: Pre-compass scattered approach

### Success Patterns

1. **Oracle 3 Model**: Orchestration infrastructure pattern
2. **Oracle 10-11 Blitzkrieg**: Parallel stream execution
3. **Oracle 12 Constellation**: Purpose-specialized platforms

- INT-P036: NEW pattern — Feedcrafting = computational RAS (filter by declared intentions, not engagement)
- INT-P037: NEW pattern — Syncrescendence IS the exocortex (connect, don't build from scratch)
- REFRAME: DC-140 security audit reclassified from Phase 5 → continuous concern
- REFRAME: DC-P20 exocortex = "connect existing exocortex to external sources via MCP"
- REFRAME: DC-P19 macOS actuators = "adopt OpenClaw CLI ecosystem, not buy GUI tools"
- REFRAME: INT-2104 feedcrafting = "computational RAS with intention-weighted scoring"
- Phase 2 assessed as SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE (all P0 items done, quality gate + cluster engine are P1)
