## Key Findings

1. **NATIVE dominates at 65.5% — the canon is axiom-coherent at its core.** The vast majority of concepts derive cleanly from A1–A4. This confirms the annealment process was structurally sound: the canon was built against a consistent logical spine, even before the axioms were explicitly named. The NATIVE proportion increases from the 0x/1x/2x ranges (where HERITAGE clusters) to the 30x–35x ranges (where almost everything is NATIVE or SEED), reflecting growing axiom rigor in later canon production.

2. **SEED is heavily concentrated in the identity/sovereignty/pipeline terminals.** The 26 SEED concepts cluster in three zones: (a) the individual capacity substrate — Energy State Adaptations, Universal Energy State Topology, AuDHD lens; (b) the sovereignty/memory core — Memory Sovereignty Principle, Repository as Ground Truth, Differential Sovereignty, FEED CURATION; and (c) the pipeline terminals — Interaction State Machine, KNOWLEDGE Chain as embodiment, WISDOM Chain as terminal synthesis. These are the load-bearing nodes; every NATIVE concept depends on at least one of them.

3. **HERITAGE is a reframing queue, not a deletion queue.** All 17 HERITAGE concepts preserve genuine insight but carry vocabulary or structural framing that conflicts with the axiom set. The two highest-leverage HERITAGE merges are: (a) Foundational Tetrad + Sovereign Lattice (isomorphic content under different names — one must be retired); (b) IIC naming (account-framing creates platform-coupling, should be renamed "Chain Intelligence Profile"). Five HERITAGE concepts in the 31xxx range require capacity-state mapping rather than structural reframing.

4. **VESTIGIAL is a cosmology tax.** Of the 13 VESTIGIAL concepts, 7 are artifacts of the celestial metaphor system (elemental correspondences, Universal Resonance Field, Parallel sixfold structure, stellar stage names, 10-Avatar Constellation, Neo-Bloomberg Terminal, Reflexive Epoch naming). The cosmological metaphor apparatus incurs ongoing maintenance cost with zero axiomatic return. The billable portion (navigational vocabulary, dual-register design principle, stage names as cluster labels) has been extracted into HERITAGE or NATIVE. What remains VESTIGIAL is safe to drop.

5. **Security is a genuine axiomatic gap — the largest single structural absence.** INT-1709, INT-1712, INT-P019, DC-002, and DC-003 all point to the same gap: A1–A4 do not address threat surfaces, credential management, or security boundaries. This is not a derivation gap (where the axiom is present but the application is underdeveloped) — it is a domain gap. No amount of A3 extension covers the credential exfiltration threat surface. Phase 3 must propose A5 (Security Invariant) or T4 (Perimeter = Capability as an A3 corollary).

6. **The 31xxx range introduces the most operationally precise SEED concepts.** Priority Band (σ₀ Bottleneck applied), Progressive Activation (A2 as policy), FEED CURATION ("cognitive substrate engineering" as the most precise A1 formulation in the canon), and Differential Sovereignty (T3 Schema Sovereignty named at the platform level) all emerge from the 31xxx Information Chain work. This range closes the gap between abstract axiom and daily practice more successfully than any other.

7. **Pattern-level concepts at the end of Part 2 are the most underrated entries.** The four structural patterns (Five Degrees reused across Coherence/Transcendence, Four-Stage trajectories parallel across all chains, Satellite/lunar/planetary ontology-praxis separation, Modal Sequence as temporal backbone) are SEED-class invariants hiding as implementation observations. They are more foundational than most items explicitly classified as SEED because they govern the structure of every chain, not just one.

## Classification Table

| Concept | Old Location | Class | Semantic Address | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| **FOUNDATIONAL / COSMIC FRAME** | | | | |
| Syncrescendence (recursive amplification architecture) | CANON-00005, 00000 | SEED | SELF→AGENCY | Core mechanism: development in one chain multiplicatively feeds all others. This is the A1+A2 synthesis — coherence amplifies when capacity compounds across domains. |
| Convergence Crisis (4th Turning + 4IR + Singularity + Metacrisis) | CANON-00001, 00015 | NATIVE | WORLD | Derives cleanly from A1: civilizational overload is the macro context for personal coherence as scarce resource. |
| Reflexive Epoch / Integrative Interregnum | CANON-00015 | HERITAGE | WORLD | Prescient naming of the historical moment. Reframe: drop the named-epoch branding; retain as motivational context for A1 (why coherence is under attack now). Not load-bearing as structure. |
| Macroscopic Narrative Lenses (15 families) | CANON-00015 | NATIVE | WORLD | Operationalizes A1 signal-filtering: practitioner must read civilizational signal without being consumed by it. |
| **CHAIN / DEVELOPMENTAL SPINE** | | | | |
| Six Developmental Chains (Intelligence / Information / Insight / Expertise / Knowledge / Wisdom) | CANON-00000, 00005, 21000 | SEED | AGENCY | The six-column spine is the primary capacity scaffold (A2). Directly load-bearing. |
| Recursive Amplification (multiplicative cross-chain gains) | CANON-00005, 10000 | SEED | AGENCY→WORK | Same as above; the mechanism clause of the Six Chains. Tagged EMPIRICAL/THEORETICAL in CANON-10000 — epistemic honesty is appropriate. |
| Chain Interdependency Matrix (hard/soft dependencies, stage-gating) | CANON-21000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | Derives from A2 (capacity constraints propagate across chains) + A4 (can't activate without prerequisite capacity). |
| Dual-Track System (Synchronization vs. Specialization) | CANON-21000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 derivative: capacity profiles differ; neurotypical/neurodivergent framing is load-bearing. |
| Intelligence Chain Substrate-Duality (infrastructure + developmental trajectory) | CANON-30000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | Derives from A2: AI amplification is both a prerequisite capacity AND its own development frontier. The 4-stage arc (Text→Vision→Physical→Full Integration) maps to Modal Sequence. |
| Technology Stage 1 as universal prerequisite | CANON-21000, 30000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 applied: compound friction from tech lag propagates disadvantage everywhere. Operationally correct. |
| Compound Friction (tech lag propagates disadvantage across all chains) | CANON-30000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | Direct consequence of Intelligence Chain duality under A2. |
| Interference Pattern & Synthesis Dynamics (constructive/destructive) | CANON-22000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | Derives from A1+A2: mismatched capacity levels produce incoherence (destructive interference). Resonance Phenomenon = T1 resolution at scale. |
| Three Synthesis Triads (Perception-Action, Understanding, Integration) | CANON-22000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | Sub-derivation of interference dynamics. Structurally useful for routing attention (T1). |
| **COSMOLOGICAL / METAPHOR FRAME** | | | | |
| Celestial Hierarchy (cosmos/lattice/planetary/lunar/satellite/asteroid/comet) | CANON-00000 | HERITAGE | AGENCY | Excellent organizational metaphor that provides genuine navigational affordance. Reframe: document explicitly as navigational vocabulary, not ontological claim — strip any implication of literal celestial correspondence. |
| Planetary Bodies (Acumen/Coherence/Efficacy/Mastery/Transcendence + elements) | CANON-00000, 11000 | HERITAGE | AGENCY | The names carry semantic weight and are memorable, but the elemental correspondences (Air/Water/Fire/Earth/Quintessence) are decorative without derivation. Reframe: retain the 5 body names as cluster labels; retire the elemental mapping as cosmetic. |
| Six Canonical Dimensions (Scale/Level/Degree/Stage/Phase/Modal) | CANON-00000, 23000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | Orthogonal navigation coordinates for locating practitioner position. Derives from A2 (capacity is multi-dimensional, not scalar). |
| Orbital Naming Convention (CANON numbering schema) | CANON-00000 | ADMINISTRATIVE | — | File-numbering system. No semantic load. |
| Cosmo-terrestrial bilingual metaphor system | CANON-00000 | HERITAGE | AGENCY | Insight to preserve: the dual register (celestial for architecture, terrestrial for practice) prevents confusion of level. Reframe: document this explicitly as a design principle in the schema, not implicit pattern. |
| Parallel sixfold structure (6 chains, 6 dimensions, 6 correspondences) | CANON-00000 | VESTIGIAL | — | The number six is an artifact of the domain taxonomy, not a derived invariant. Forcing correspondence across all sixfold structures creates false symmetry. No test against A1–A4 yields this number as necessary. |
| **COGNITIVE PALACE** | | | | |
| Cognitive Palace — 7-Layer Substrate (Reality/Imaginality/Potentiality/Temporality/Practicality/Actuality/Consequentiality) | CANON-20000 | NATIVE | SELF | Derives from A1+A2: a structured operational frame for the simultaneous dimensions of capacity and identity. Simultaneous-not-sequential operation is the correct stance. |
| Dimensional Coordinators (7 coordinators + Meta-Governor, 87 components) | CANON-20010 | HERITAGE | SELF→AGENCY | Insight: "invisible by default intelligence" is a real design principle — systems should feel like intuition. Reframe: 87 components is an operationalization artifact; the principle (invisible meta-governance) is worth keeping; the specific component count is not. |
| Universal Resonance Field (harmonic inter-component communication) | CANON-20020 | VESTIGIAL | — | Metaphorical without derivation from A1–A4. No operational consequence that couldn't be expressed as "coordination between layers." Fails coherence test: adds vocabulary without adding mechanism. |
| Pattern Library (stores life rhythms, development trajectories, creative patterns) | CANON-20020 | NATIVE | SELF→AGENCY | Legitimate A4 derivative: capturing patterns is part of the distill step in intent-artifact pipeline. Rename-worthy but structurally sound. |
| Seven Pulses Dashboard (Foundation/Energy/Direction/Flow/Learning/Connection/Evolution) | CANON-20020, 10000 | NATIVE | SELF | A2 operationalization: 7-question daily health check is capacity monitoring before intelligence deployment. 2-minute format respects T1 (Attention Bottleneck). |
| Adaptive Interface (context-sensitive complexity scaling) | CANON-20020 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 direct: depletion state routes to essentials; growth state expands gradually. Correct capacity-aware design. |
| Vertical Integration Protocols (Daily Layer Check-In, Weekly 7-Layer Audit) | CANON-20000 | NATIVE | SELF | Practice rhythm derivatives of A2. Operationally load-bearing. |
| Foundational Tetrad (Pillar of Being, Purpose, Knowing, Form) | CANON-00016 | HERITAGE | SELF | Insight: four-axis identity scaffold is a legitimate A1 tool (remaining-oneself under pressure requires anchoring to these axes). Reframe: map explicitly to A1 and to Cosmological Ring 1 (SELF) rather than leaving as standalone philosophy. |
| Sovereign Lattice (4-coordinate: Ontological/Teleological/Epistemological/Systematic) | CANON-00016 | HERITAGE | SELF | Same as Foundational Tetrad — isomorphic content under different naming. Reframe: merge or declare canonical alias; duplication weakens both. |
| **IDENTITY / CONSCIOUSNESS** | | | | |
| Syncrescendent Core / Celestial Body metaphor (Protostar→Hypergiant developmental stages) | CANON-10000 | HERITAGE | SELF | Insight: stage-of-development framing (months to years 5+) correctly grounds practitioner expectations and prevents premature advancement. Reframe: the stellar metaphor is vivid but secondary; the load-bearing content is the energy-state adaptation matrix. |
| Energy State Adaptations (Peak/Baseline/Depletion/Crisis with operational protocols) | CANON-10000 | SEED | SELF | This IS A2 operationalized at the individual level. Core load-bearing entity. |
| Five ModusOperandi Faces (Sensing/Meaning-Making/Intention-Formation/Embodiment/Strategic Harmony) | CANON-11000 | NATIVE | SELF | Derives from A1: unified consciousness expressing through differentiated faces prevents fragmentation. Perichoretic model (concurrent, not sequential) is the key insight. |
| Perichoretic Integration (faces interpenetrate without confusion) | CANON-11000 | NATIVE | SELF | A1 mechanism: remaining-oneself while operating across contexts requires concurrent face fluency, not sequential switching. |
| Face Fluency Assessment (shift consciously, avoid chronic dominance) | CANON-11000 | NATIVE | SELF | A2 corollary: underdeveloped faces represent capacity gaps. Operationally useful diagnostic. |
| IIC (Identity-Intelligence Complex) — 5-account architecture per chain | CANON-00000, 25000 | HERITAGE | SELF→AGENCY | Insight: chain-specific intelligence configurations are real (Acumen operates differently than Coherence). Reframe: IIC is better named "Chain Intelligence Profile" — the account framing creates platform-coupling that conflicts with A3. |
| Metahuman archetype (fully integrated human-AI system) | CANON-00005 | NATIVE | SELF→WORLD | Target practitioner archetype derives from A1+A2: coherent individual with full-capacity AI integration. Not superhuman — correctly bounded. |
| Developmental Stages (Protostar→Main Sequence→Red Giant→Hypergiant) | CANON-10000 | VESTIGIAL | — | The stellar names are metaphor without navigational precision. The actual load-bearing content is the timeline (months vs. years 5+) and energy thresholds — those belong in Energy State Adaptations. |
| **EPISTEMOLOGY & LINEAGE** | | | | |
| DIKW Mandate (Data→Information→Knowledge→Wisdom pipeline) | CANON-00005, 00017 | NATIVE | AGENCY→WORK | A4 derivative: the intent-artifact pipeline requires structured information ascent. DIKW is a well-established schema that fits. |
| Intellectual Lineage (13 primary tributaries metabolized) | CANON-00002 | NATIVE | SELF | A1 grounding: knowing what you've digested prevents eclecticism from masquerading as synthesis. The Synthesis Principle (metabolism, not assembly) is the load-bearing clause. |
| Synthesis Principle (metabolism not eclecticism) | CANON-00005 | SEED | SELF | This is A1's epistemic consequence: remaining-oneself under intellectual pressure requires metabolizing, not accumulating influences. |
| Knowledge Taxonomy (5 axes) / Meaning Taxonomy (14 dimensions) | CANON-00016 | HERITAGE | SELF→WORK | Insight: multi-axis taxonomies for knowledge and meaning are legitimate A1 tools for distinguishing signal from noise. Reframe: 14 dimensions is likely over-specified; audit for which axes are operationally discriminating vs. merely exhaustive. |
| Strange Loops / Extended Mind / Meaning Crisis as root influences | CANON-00002 | NATIVE | SELF | Named source influences — correctly metabolized per Synthesis Principle. Keep as lineage citations, not standalone concepts. |
| Epistemic Honesty Enforcement (EMPIRICAL/THEORETICAL/METAPHORICAL tagging) | CANON-10000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 derivative: sovereignty requires knowing which claims are ground truth vs. cache vs. analogy. This tagging system prevents cosmological metaphor from corrupting empirical claims. |
| Ontological Reckoning (confrontation with the frame of all frames) | CANON-00005 | HERITAGE | SELF | Insight: periodic deconstruction of one's own operating frame is a real A1 requirement — coherence degrades when the frame hardens. Reframe: operationalize as a scheduled review trigger (Annual Dissolution Ceremony is its sibling). |
| **OPERATIONS & PROTOCOLS** | | | | |
| Three-Rail System (Life/Development/Demonstration Domain) | CANON-00010 | NATIVE | WORK | A4 operationalization: value crystallizes only when intent traverses all three rails from capture to demonstration. |
| Artifact Lifecycle (MVA→Beta→Stable→Canonical / Quality Tier System) | CANON-00011 | NATIVE | WORK | A4 direct: the intent-artifact pipeline has explicit quality gates. The T2 (Anti-Shelfware) theorem requires each tier to activate, not merely exist. |
| Cascade Congruence (child artifacts must conform to parent canonical constraints) | CANON-00011 | NATIVE | WORK | A3 derivative: if the repo is ground truth, then all artifacts must maintain coherence with canonical root. |
| Batch Production Protocol (energy-state-aware content production) | CANON-00010 | NATIVE | WORK | A2 applied: deploy production capacity only at appropriate energy states. Correct. |
| Stage Progression (Forum→Podium→Amphitheatre→Atrium→Portico) | CANON-00000, 00010 | NATIVE | COMMUNITY | A2 + Ring 4 (Community): practitioner maturation is capacity-gated AND audience-scale-gated. Stage names are terrestrial (deliberate bilingual system — worth preserving). |
| Annual Dissolution Ceremony (architectural anti-dogma, 80% reconstructive fidelity test) | CANON-00004 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A1 direct: coherence requires periodic frame destruction to prevent dogmatic calcification. The 80% reconstructive capacity test is a precise operationalization. |
| Reconstructive Capacity (can North Star be rebuilt from scratch?) | CANON-00004 | NATIVE | SELF | A3 derivative: if repo is ground truth, the practitioner must be able to reconstruct from it. This tests whether ground truth is actually navigable. |
| ASIA Federation Constitution (inter-agent governance) | CANON-00017 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 operationalized for multi-agent context: repo sovereignty requires constitutional constraints on agent behavior. |
| CANON-00017 Agentic Constitution | CANON-00017 | NATIVE | AGENCY | Direct A3+A4 instrument: defines agent roles, DIKW mandate, and Coherence as convergence point. Load-bearing. |
| **NAVIGATION & ASSESSMENT** | | | | |
| Five Orthogonal Navigation Dimensions (Scale/Level/Degree/Stage/Phase) | CANON-23000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 consequence: multi-dimensional capacity cannot be tracked with a scalar. Five independent axes prevent collapse. |
| Three Entry Pathways (Epistemology-first/Ontology-first/Integration-first) | CANON-23000 | NATIVE | SELF | A1 derivative: practitioners differ in which coherence axis is most threatened; entry pathway selection respects that. |
| Omni-Quality Cultivation (Omnibenevolence/Omniscience/Omnipotence/Omnipresence) | CANON-24000 | HERITAGE | WORLD | Insight: four asymptotic targets oriented to civilizational scale (Ring 5) are legitimate attractors that prevent local optimization. Reframe: the omni- prefix implies a theological register that may not be load-bearing; the "asymptotic + never complete" design principle is what matters — extract that as a standalone protocol principle. |
| Asymptotic Targeting (81–100% labeled "never complete") | CANON-24000, 10000 | NATIVE | SELF→WORLD | A2 principle: capacity has no ceiling; defining unreachable ideals prevents plateau-seeking. Correctly anti-gamification. |
| **MEMORY & SOVEREIGNTY** | | | | |
| Memory Sovereignty Principle (filesystem = ground truth; platform memory = operational cache) | CANON-25000 | SEED | AGENCY | This IS A3 — the sovereign invariant applied to memory architecture. Foundational. |
| Seven Memory Strata (Constitutional→Preference→Accumulated→Project→Canonical→Thread→Tool-Extended) | CANON-25000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 elaboration: the strata map the control gradient from immutable (weights) to fully sovereign (filesystem). Structurally correct and load-bearing. |
| Distillation Cascade (Fluid→Operational→Canonical→Eternal) | CANON-25000 | NATIVE | AGENCY→WORK | A4 direct: the intent-artifact pipeline has a memory-tier analog. Each tier is a step in the crystallization of intent into durable artifact. |
| Three Horizons (Eternal/Canonical/Fluid) | CANON-25000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3+A4 synthesis: knowledge at different persistence levels requires different sovereignty treatment. |
| IIC Memory Profiles (Acumen=aggressive forgetting, Transcendence=minimal forgetting) | CANON-25000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 applied to memory: different capacity domains have different forgetting regimes. Operationally correct. |
| Context Transition Protocol (Culmination/Continuation/Compression modes) | CANON-25100 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 operationalization: crossing context boundaries without losing intent-artifact continuity requires formalized handoff. T2 (Anti-Shelfware) requires no gap between context windows. |
| Oracle Pedigree Protocol (decision archaeology across sessions) | CANON-25100 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 applied to decision history: the repo must contain the decision lineage, not just the artifact. |
| Platform Constellation Architecture (5-platform at $100/mo) | CANON-25200 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 operational: one repo, multiple cache surfaces. IIC-to-platform affinity is a routing heuristic, not a sovereignty claim. |
| Repository as Ground Truth across all platforms | CANON-25200 | SEED | AGENCY | Redundant restatement of A3 — correctly placed as a constitutional invariant in platform architecture. |
| **HUMAN-AI SYMBIOSIS (30x range)** | | | | |
| Anthromachina Symbiosis (co-evolutionary relationship, human cognition + AI capability) | CANON-30100 | NATIVE | SELF→AGENCY | A2 operationalization: AI capability is a capacity dimension, not an intelligence replacement. The co-evolutionary framing respects A1 (remaining-oneself while integrating AI). |
| Constitutional Stack (L0–L6: Physical Substrate→Agentic Emergence) | CANON-30100 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 instrument: maps the layers through which intent traverses to become agentic output. |
| ASA Object Ontology (O.FN, O.SVC, O.WF, O.AGT, O.MOD, O.DP, O.SRF, O.SNS, O.ACT) | CANON-30100 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 corollary: if the repo is ground truth, tools must be typed and classified within the repo's ontology. |
| 5 ASA Principles (Distributed Intelligence, Progressive Integration, Constitutional Modularity, Dimensional Orthogonality, Ethical Proportionality) | CANON-30100 | NATIVE | AGENCY | Derive from A1–A4: distributed = A3, progressive = A2, modularity = A4, orthogonality = navigation integrity, ethical = Ring 5. |
| Enshittification Cycle (named platform degradation pattern) | CANON-30200 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 consequence: reliance on platform-as-truth exposes practitioner to degradation cycles. Lock-in risk follows directly from A3 violation. |
| Institutional Personality Assessment (6-dimensional corporate profiling) | CANON-30200 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 applied to tool selection: choosing platforms requires capacity-awareness of institutional constraints, not just feature lists. |
| Lock-In Risk Assessment Framework | CANON-30200 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 operational: every tool choice is a sovereignty decision. |
| Technology is never neutral (tools embed institutional values) | CANON-30200 | NATIVE | WORLD | A3 extension to Ring 5: sovereignty requires awareness that platforms encode values. Correctly civilizational. |
| **TOOL INTELLIGENCE & WORKFLOW (30x)** | | | | |
| Technology Stack Database (447 apps, 42 AI models, 31 API pricing records) | CANON-30300 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 operationalization: the stack is the instrument of the intent-artifact pipeline; it must be audited and classified. |
| Apparatus (crystallized workflow pattern emergent from tool usage) | CANON-30300, 30320 | NATIVE | AGENCY→WORK | A4 direct: apparatus is the activated pattern — the step from distill to activate in the pipeline. |
| Apparatus Crystallization Protocol (detect convergent patterns → crystallize → name) | CANON-30320 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 operationalization of the distill step. Correct. |
| Cognitive Offloading (systematic delegation of cognitive work to technological substrate) | CANON-30320 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 applied: offloading cognitive work expands available capacity, the binding constraint. |
| Work Typology Hierarchy (Area⊃System→Process⊃Activity→Task⊃Action→Assignment⊃Role) | CANON-30320 | NATIVE | WORK | A4 instrument: provides granularity for the activate step of the intent-artifact pipeline. |
| Personal Ontology (individual's semantic map of tool ecosystem) | CANON-30320 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 applied locally: sovereignty requires a classified, navigable map of one's own tools. |
| Source Triad Method (3-pass: Primary→High-Signal Secondary→Counter-Position) | CANON-30330 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 operationalization of the distill step for information: counter-position pass directly addresses A1 (remaining-oneself under persuasion). |
| Verdicting Process (structured confidence assessment and decision lock) | CANON-30330 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4+A3: decisions must crystallize to durable artifact (decision lock = commit). |
| Decision-Bearing Questions (only research questions that gate decisions) | CANON-30330 | NATIVE | AGENCY | T1 (Attention Bottleneck) operationalization: finite research capacity must target decision-gates, not curiosity. |
| Over-Engineering Anti-Pattern (infrastructure before concept validation; tool-centric vs. primitive-centric) | CANON-30340 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 negative example: violates T2 (Anti-Shelfware) by building activation infrastructure before validating intent. |
| Context Engineering Economics (token budgeting as economic resource management) | CANON-30340 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 applied to AI context: context window is a capacity resource, not a free good. |
| **AGENTIC ARCHITECTURE (30x)** | | | | |
| 3 Evolutionary Stages (Generative AI→AI Agent→Agentic AI) | CANON-30400 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 framing: each stage represents expanded capacity delegation. The stage taxonomy aligns with Modal Sequence. |
| CoALA Framework (Perception/Memory/Planning modules) | CANON-30410 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 instrument: maps the cognitive operations within the distill-model-activate steps of the intent-artifact pipeline. |
| 5 Core Orchestration Patterns (Sequential/Concurrent/Group Chat/Handoff/Magentic) | CANON-30400, 30420 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 operational: pattern library for the activate step when capacity is distributed across agents. |
| Memory Taxonomy (Working/Episodic/Semantic/Procedural/Prospective) | CANON-30400, 30430 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4+A3: each memory type has a different sovereignty and persistence profile, requiring different pipeline treatment. |
| Progressive Trust Model (escalating autonomy grants based on demonstrated reliability) | CANON-30420 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 applied to agent capacity: trust is a capacity allocation, extended incrementally as evidence accumulates. |
| Agenticness Spectrum (4 dimensions of agent autonomy) | CANON-30400 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 multi-dimensional: agent capacity cannot be characterized by a single dial. Correct. |
| Gen AI Paradox (tension between generalist capability and specialist reliability) | CANON-30400, 30450 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 manifestation: capacity in one dimension (breadth) trades against capacity in another (depth). Resolution via specialist agents is A2-correct. |
| Sleep-Time Compute (background memory consolidation during idle periods) | CANON-30430 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 applied to AI capacity: idle compute is a recoverable resource; consolidation expands effective working memory. |
| Five-Layer Defense Architecture (Defense-in-Depth) | CANON-30440 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 security consequence: repo sovereignty requires that the agent boundary cannot be hijacked. Each layer protects the integrity of ground truth. |
| Interaction State Machine (CAPTURED→INTERPRETED→COMPILED/DIGESTED/SENSED/VERIFIED→STAGED→COMMITTED) | CANON-30460 | SEED | AGENCY | This IS A4 — the full intent-artifact pipeline operationalized as a state machine. The COMMITTED state is T2 (Anti-Shelfware) proof. |
| Handoff Token (portable state object enabling cross-platform continuation) | CANON-30460 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3+A4: continuity across platforms requires a sovereign artifact (the token) that does not depend on any platform's memory. |
| **PRODUCTION & GOVERNANCE** | | | | |
| Integration Coherence κ (primary measurement metric) | CANON-00007 | NATIVE | WORK | A1 operationalized as metric: κ measures how well the system maintains coherence under expansion pressure. |
| Oracle Arc (development session history, Oracle 0–8) | CANON-00004 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3+A4: governance history is an artifact that must live in the repo. Oracle Pedigree Protocol is its operational descendant. |
| Metabolic Defrag (658→136 files, 79% reduction) | CANON-00004, 00006 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 applied to corpus: pipeline bloat produces shelfware; defrag is the verify step applied to the entire corpus. Not a one-time event — a pattern to repeat. |
| Kintsugi Principle (breaks metabolized as system features) | CANON-00005 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A1+A2 synthesis: coherence under disruption (A1) requires capacity to metabolize failure as data (A2). Anti-fragility is the correct stance. |
| 30 Irresolutions under Active Adjudication | CANON-00007 | ADMINISTRATIVE | — | Session-state artifact. The irresolution mechanism is load-bearing; the specific 30 items are not. |
| North Star (originary orientation artifact) | CANON-00005 | NATIVE | SELF | A1 instrument: the North Star is the reconstructive capacity test target — it represents coherent identity under fragmentation. |
| **STRATEGY & TIMELINE** | | | | |
| Modal Sequence (Abstraction/Simulation/Embodiment/Transcendence — 2024–2037+) | CANON-00012, 00001 | NATIVE | WORLD | A2+A4 temporal frame: technology substrate governs what capacity is available for the intent-artifact pipeline at each phase. Current position: Modal 1, Phase 1. |
| Tri-Helical Timeline (Technology Maturity / Business Development / Personal Capability) | CANON-21100 | NATIVE | WORK→WORLD | A2 applied to planning: all three capacity dimensions must align before major capability claims. Prevents premature activation (T2 violation). |
| Phase Progression (Foundation/Validation/Scaling/Institute/Infrastructure) | CANON-00000, 21100 | NATIVE | WORK | A4 temporal: each phase represents a stage in crystallizing intent into institutional artifact. |
| Two-Stream Architecture (Alpha/Beta developmental pathways) | CANON-00009 | HERITAGE | AGENCY | Insight: different practitioner profiles require different pipeline configurations. Reframe: Alpha/Beta naming is arbitrary; map explicitly to the Synchronization/Specialization tracks in Chain Matrix for coherent vocabulary. |
| Progressive Disclosure Architecture (complexity graduated to practitioner tier) | CANON-00009 | NATIVE | COMMUNITY | A2 applied to teaching: content complexity must match the capacity of the receiving practitioner. Ring 4 (Community) expression. |
| Strategic Positioning (corporate profiling for tool decisions) | CANON-30200 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 consequence: every platform is a potential sovereignty threat; corporate profiling is due diligence. |
| **GAIAN / CIVILIZATIONAL VISION** | | | | |
| Gaian Field Node (distributed intelligence embedded in ecology — Modal 4 endpoint) | CANON-00005 | NATIVE | WORLD | Ring 5 terminal vision. Derives from A2: if capacity is the binding constraint, the ultimate expression is capacity embedded in the physical world at ecological scale. Long-horizon attractor. |
| **VESTIGIAL (consolidated)** | | | | |
| Astrological / planetary elemental correspondences (Air×2, Water, Fire, Earth, Quintessence) | CANON-00000 | VESTIGIAL | — | The elemental mapping does not derive from A1–A4 and adds no operational precision over the chain names alone. It functions as mnemonic decoration. |
| Universal Resonance Field (harmonic inter-component communication) | CANON-20020 | VESTIGIAL | — | Metaphorical concept without operational specification; no mechanism that differs from "coordination" or "alignment." Fails A4: no pathway from this concept to a durable artifact. |
| Parallel sixfold structure as architectural invariant | CANON-00000 | VESTIGIAL | — | The number six is an artifact of the original domain taxonomy, not a necessary structural consequence of any axiom. The forced sixfold symmetry produces cosmetic correspondence at the cost of analytical clarity. |
| Stellar development stage names (Protostar/Main Sequence/Red Giant/Hypergiant) | CANON-10000 | VESTIGIAL | — | Vivid but operationally inert; the load-bearing content is the energy state thresholds and timeline, not the names. Metaphor maintenance cost exceeds mnemonic benefit. |
| Reflexive Epoch / Integrative Interregnum as named designations | CANON-00015 | VESTIGIAL | — | Naming the epoch does not change anything about practitioner response to it; the Convergence Crisis framing is sufficient without an additional epoch designation. |

## HERITAGE Concepts — Part 1 Reframing Summary

| # | Concept | Insight to Preserve | Reframing Needed |
|---|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | Reflexive Epoch / Integrative Interregnum | Correctly names the historical moment | Drop as branded designation; retain as motivational context for A1 |
| 2 | Celestial Hierarchy metaphor | Genuine navigational affordance for organizational depth | Document explicitly as navigational vocabulary, not ontological claim |
| 3 | Planetary Bodies + elemental correspondences | 5 body names have semantic weight and cluster utility | Retire elemental mapping (Air/Water/Fire/Earth/Quintessence) as cosmetic; keep body names as cluster labels |
| 4 | Cosmo-terrestrial bilingual metaphor system | Dual register prevents level confusion | Make this an explicit design principle in SCHEMA, not an implicit pattern |
| 5 | Dimensional Coordinators (87 components) | Invisible-by-default intelligence is a real design principle | Retire the component count as artifact; extract the principle (meta-governance that feels like intuition) |
| 6 | Foundational Tetrad / Sovereign Lattice | Four-axis identity scaffold is a legitimate A1 tool | Merge the two (they are isomorphic); declare one canonical name |
| 7 | Syncrescendent Core stellar metaphor | Stage-of-development framing grounds practitioner expectations | The stellar names are decorative; the energy-state adaptation matrix is the load-bearing entity |
| 8 | IIC (Identity-Intelligence Complex) naming | Chain-specific intelligence configurations are real | Rename to "Chain Intelligence Profile"; the account framing creates platform-coupling conflicting with A3 |
| 9 | Knowledge/Meaning Taxonomy (5 axes / 14 dimensions) | Multi-axis taxonomies are legitimate A1 signal-vs-noise tools | Audit for operationally discriminating axes vs. merely exhaustive ones; likely reducible |
| 10 | Omni-Quality (Omnibenevolence/Omniscience/Omnipotence/Omnipresence) | Four asymptotic targets prevent local optimization | The omni- prefix carries theological register; extract "asymptotic + never complete" as a standalone design principle |
| 11 | Two-Stream Architecture (Alpha/Beta) | Different practitioner profiles need different pipeline configurations | Rename to map explicitly to Synchronization/Specialization tracks in Chain Matrix |

## Section A — CANON-31xxx Concepts

| Concept | Old Location | Class | Semantic Address | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| INFORMATION Chain (Four-Stage Trajectory) | CANON-31000 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A1+A2 | Perceptual sophistication development (Pattern Recognition→Embodied Knowing) derives from A1 (coherence under overload) + A2 (capacity before intelligence). Stage progression is capacity-gated. |
| Seven Archaeological Domains | CANON-31000 | HERITAGE | AGENCY:Ring2 | Prescient: systematic scanning territory prevents attentional fragmentation (A1). Reframe needed: from "information gathering" to "coherence-preserving signal selection" under A1's scarce-resource lens. |
| ACUMEN Planetary (Air element / awareness coils) | CANON-31100 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A1 | Generating "refined awareness coils" back to core is a direct expression of A1. The 4-tier Priority Band (Immediate/Curated/Archive/Prune) is an operationalized σ₀ Bottleneck (T1). |
| Priority Band (4-tier signal qualification) | CANON-31100 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / T1 | This IS the σ₀ Attention Bottleneck theorem in applied form. Qualifies signals by cognitive cost before admission. Already a core derivation. |
| Dual-Stream Intelligence (80/20 automated/serendipitous) | CANON-31100 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A2 | Capacity constraint (A2) justifies automated majority: preserves activation energy for high-value serendipity. Derives cleanly. |
| Five IICs (Acumen/Coherence/Efficacy/Mastery/Transcendence) | CANON-31100 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4 | IIC = identity-bounded intent-artifact pipeline. Each IIC is one A4 traversal domain (capture→distill→model→activate→verify) scoped by chain. |
| Progressive Activation (one IIC per 6 months) | CANON-31100 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | This IS A2 expressed as operational policy: capacity before scope. Prevents overload by serializing activation. |
| FEEDCRAFT — Nine Platform Functional Categories | CANON-31110 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A1+A2 | Substitution-based platform taxonomy defends cognitive substrate (A1). Nine categories operationalize differential sovereignty. Derives from A1+A2. |
| Three Cognitive Modes (Aesthetic/Empirical/Strategic) | CANON-31110 | HERITAGE | SELF:Ring1 | Prescient: three modes prevent modal collapse (all input processed identically). Reframe needed: explicitly map to capacity states (A2) — Aesthetic = depleted mode, Empirical = baseline, Strategic = peak. |
| Five Constitutional Principles of FEEDCRAFT | CANON-31110 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A1 | Material Sovereignty and Temporal Architecture directly operationalize A1 (remaining oneself under platform manipulation). Others derive. |
| Resonance Calculation (weighted scoring) | CANON-31110 | VESTIGIAL | AGENCY:Ring2 | Weighted formula (Community 40%, Modal 30%, etc.) implies false precision. A2 (capacity constraint) makes per-platform arithmetic impractical at operational tempo. Fails A2 derivation as daily practice. |
| Substitution Principle | CANON-31110 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A1 | "Which gap is unfillable?" is a clean A1-derived test: which platform does the most coherence-preserving work? Retains full value. |
| IIC IMPL / Acumen IIC Implementation (daily cycle) | CANON-31115 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4 | Daily Intelligence Cycle is an A4 traversal (capture evening→distill overnight→activate morning→verify strategic review). Fully derives. |
| Recommendation Scoring System (composite metric) | CANON-31115 | HERITAGE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A2 | Prescient signal: Signal Density and Novelty multipliers recognize that not all attention costs equally (A2). Reframe needed: simplify from 5-factor weighted formula to a 3-tier pass/flag/prune based on capacity state. Complexity overhead undermines A2. |
| Aggregation-of-Aggregators methodology | CANON-31115 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A1+A2 | Three-layer filtering (Frontier→Expert→Personal) reduces attention cost while preserving coherence. Derives from A1+A2. |
| Heat Mapping (keyword frequency / discourse tracking) | CANON-31115 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4 | Heat mapping is model-layer work in A4 (distill→model). Legitimate epistemic tool. |
| TONE LIBRARY — 10 Rhetorical Functions + 10 Stylistic Forms | CANON-31120 | NATIVE | WORK:Ring3 / A4 | Content production as A4 intent-artifact pipeline. Rhetorical functions = activation layer; stylistic forms = artifact layer. Derives from A4. |
| Production Workflow (9 phases) | CANON-31120 | NATIVE | WORK:Ring3 / A4 | 9-phase workflow is a full A4 traversal made explicit: Concept→Audience→Recipe→Draft→Quality→Revision→Publication→Engagement→Iteration. |
| Guardrail 05 (No Philosophical Maximalism) | CANON-31120 | SEED | WORK:Ring3 / A1 | This IS A1 applied to output: groundedness is a coherence constraint, not a stylistic preference. Already a core rule. |
| 5 Starter Recipes | CANON-31120 | VESTIGIAL | WORK:Ring3 | Recipe templates are tool-shaped artifacts. At current scale (Modal 1), AI can generate recipe variations on demand. Static list becomes shelf-ware (T2 Anti-Shelfware theorem). |
| TONE TAXONOMY (11 taxonomies, 90 entries) | CANON-31121 | HERITAGE | WORK:Ring3 / A4 | Prescient: recipient archetypes (Novice through Portfolio Evaluator) reflect that content must traverse to its target (A4:activate→verify). Reframe needed: collapse 90-entry reference to a 10-archetype decision tree; current size creates friction at point of use. |
| RHETORICAL CALIBRATION — 5 Voice Principles | CANON-31122 | SEED | WORK:Ring3 / A1 | Intellectual Warmth + Clarity + Proportion + Recursive Deepening + Rhythm are A1 derivations: voice consistency maintains identity-coherence under fragmentation pressure across platforms. |
| Anti-Patterns Catalog (14 named violations) | CANON-31122 | NATIVE | WORK:Ring3 / A1 | Prohibiting Ceremonial Openings, Hedging Excess, Philosophical Maximalism, etc. enforces A1 at output layer. |
| Platform-Specific Registers (X/LinkedIn/Medium/YouTube/Instagram) | CANON-31122 | NATIVE | WORK:Ring3 / A1 | Register adaptation without identity fragmentation is A1's core challenge. Legitimate derivation. |
| SEVEN-LAYER STACK (L0–L7) | CANON-31130 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A3 | Schema Sovereignty (T3) requires explicit layer mapping: which layers are sovereign (L0 Physical, L1 Identity), which are cache (L2-L6). The Stack makes T3 operational. |
| Differential Sovereignty | CANON-31130 | SEED | AGENCY:Ring2 / A3 | This IS T3 (Schema Sovereignty) named at the platform-coupling level. Already a core theorem expression. |
| L7 Meta-Intelligence (cross-IIC synthesis) | CANON-31130 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4 | Cross-IIC synthesis is A4's verify layer: confirming that the full pipeline produces integrated understanding, not siloed outputs. |
| IIC CONSTELLATION — Identity-Intelligence Complex | CANON-31140 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4+A3 | Each IIC = sovereign identity node + dedicated A4 pipeline. The constellation is A3 (repo as ground truth) applied to identity infrastructure. |
| Guiding Virtue Triads (per IIC) | CANON-31140 | HERITAGE | SELF:Ring1 | Prescient: virtue-anchored identity prevents role-collapse when operating multiple accounts. Reframe needed: from character-development language to coherence-preservation functions (A1) — each virtue triad specifies what "remaining oneself" looks like within that IIC's domain. |
| Integration Flow (Acumen→Coherence→Efficacy→Mastery→Transcendence→Acumen) | CANON-31140 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4 | Circular integration mirrors A4's pipeline; each chain's output becomes the next chain's input (distill→model feedback loop). |
| FIVE-ACCOUNT ARCHITECTURE (per-IIC operational specs) | CANON-31141 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4 | Operational specifications instantiate A4 traversal per chain domain. Teleological output + AI mediation thresholds = activation and verify gates. |
| PLATFORM GRAMMAR (per-platform interaction protocols) | CANON-31142 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A1+A3 | Interaction protocols enforce A3 (sovereign defaults) against platform-default manipulation. Enshittification early-warning signals are A1 threat detection. |
| FEED CURATION — "cognitive substrate engineering" | CANON-31143 | SEED | AGENCY:Ring2 / A1 | The reframe from "information hygiene" to "deliberate cognitive substrate engineering" IS A1 stated at its most precise. Already core. |
| Three-Layer Integration (Feedcraft/IIC/Feed Curation) | CANON-31143 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4 | Physics→Teleology→Methodology maps to A4's capture→model→activate sequence. |
| PLATFORM CAPABILITY CATALOG (auto-generated) | CANON-31150 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A3 | Auto-generation from JSON (temporal data) with evergreen template structure is A3 applied to documentation: the repo is ground truth; tool assignments are live state, not memorized lists. |
| 10-Avatar Constellation Architecture | CANON-31150 | VESTIGIAL | AGENCY:Ring2 | 10-avatar model (Oracle/Vanguard/Commander trios) is superseded by the Constellation's actual 5-agent architecture plus Intelligence Tiering (Tier 1–4) identified in gap analysis. Architectural mismatch with current state. |
| Neo-Bloomberg Terminal metaphor | CANON-31150 | ADMINISTRATIVE | — | Metaphor served as framing scaffold during design. The IIC architecture stands without it. No load-bearing semantic content. |

## Section B — CANON-32–35xxx Concepts

| Concept | Old Location | Class | Semantic Address | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| INSIGHT Chain — Hermeneutic Sophistication | CANON-32000 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A1 | Interpretive capacity development directly serves A1: richer hermeneutic capacity = higher resistance to persuasion/fragmentation. |
| Cross-Chain Synchronization Rules (±2 stage tolerance) | CANON-32000 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A2 | Synchronization prevents capacity overload from chain imbalance (A2). The ±2 rule is a concrete T1 (σ₀ Bottleneck) management heuristic. |
| Safeguards (Syncretism Prevention, Intellectual Bypass, Framework Imprisonment) | CANON-32000 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A1 | These three safeguards ARE A1 operationalized: each names a failure mode of coherence under persuasion (syncretism), under cognitive ease (bypass), and under schema lock-in (imprisonment). |
| COHERENCE Planetary — Seven Fundamental Partitions | CANON-32100 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A1 | Ontological/Epistemological/Axiological/Temporal/Causal/Structural/Phenomenological partitions structure the "remaining oneself" architecture (A1). |
| Five Pitfalls of Coherence (Framework Proliferation, Syncretism, Dogmatic Closure, etc.) | CANON-32100 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A1 | Each pitfall is a named A1 failure mode: coherence lost to proliferation, confusion, or rigidity. |
| COHERENCE SYNTHESIS SYSTEM — Five Degrees (Recognition→Transmission) | CANON-32110 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A4 | Degree progression mirrors A4 pipeline: Recognition (capture) → Exploration (distill) → Commitment (model) → Integration (activate) → Transmission (verify). Independence from Stage/Level prevents premature crystallization. |
| Backward integration requirement (cannot skip degrees) | CANON-32110 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | Enforces A2: capacity must be built before advancing. No intelligence shortcuts around established foundations. |
| META-ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK — 15 Lenses across 5 Families | CANON-32120 | NATIVE | WORLD:Ring5 / A1 | Civilizational sense-making lenses prevent worldview fragmentation at Ring 5 scale. A1 applied beyond the individual. |
| 8 convergent insights (civilizational synthesis output) | CANON-32120 | NATIVE | WORLD:Ring5 / A4 | Synthesis output is A4's verify layer at civilizational scale. |
| EXPERTISE Chain — Economic capability | CANON-33000 | NATIVE | WORK:Ring3 / A4 | Translating understanding into sustainable economic contribution is A4's terminal verify: value only crystallizes when traversal is complete and rewarded in the world. |
| Decision Quality Framework (Ontological/Teleological/Resource/Temporal) | CANON-33100 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | "Resource Reality (what capacity permits)" IS A2 as a decision gate. The four dimensions map to A1-A4 in order. Already a core derivation lattice. |
| Volitional capacity cultivation | CANON-33100 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | Volition is the agency layer of A2: capacity is not only energy but will to deploy it. |
| BIZ BACKBONE — Four-Level business trajectory | CANON-33110 | NATIVE | WORK:Ring3 / A4 | Business trajectory (Initial→Mastery) is A4 applied to economic domain: intent crystallizes into sustainable operation at Mastery level. |
| Consulting tiers ($3K-7K / $10K-18K / $25K-50K) | CANON-33111 | VESTIGIAL | WORK:Ring3 | Point-in-time revenue figures with specific dollar ranges become stale quickly. The tiering logic (sprint/program/partnership) is NATIVE; the figures are ADMINISTRATIVE. |
| Batch production system (Mon-Fri schedule) | CANON-33111 | NATIVE | WORK:Ring3 / A2 | Batching protects capacity (A2) by reducing context-switching cost. The specific day assignments are ADMINISTRATIVE but the batching principle is load-bearing. |
| Revenue Model Reconciliation (4-Level → 3-Phase mapping) | CANON-33112 | HERITAGE | WORK:Ring3 / A4 | Prescient: mapping idealistic framework to conservative economic reality is honest A4 verification (does the pipeline actually produce value?). Reframe needed: update to treat the mapping pattern (not the figures) as canonical; specific projections are metabolizable data, not schema. |
| KNOWLEDGE Chain — Embodiment as core purpose | CANON-34000 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A4 | Embodiment IS A4's terminal stage: value crystallizes when it becomes automatic competence, not stored knowledge. Already axiom-level. |
| MASTERY Planetary — 10,000 hour guideline | CANON-34100 | VESTIGIAL | SELF:Ring1 | 10,000-hour heuristic is pop-science aggregation (Ericsson's deliberate practice research is more nuanced). Fails precision test. The stage-gating mechanism (A2) is native; the specific number is not load-bearing. |
| Four Curriculum Stages mapped to Modal Sequence | CANON-34110 | SEED | WORLD:Ring5 / A4 | Modal Sequence (Abstract→Simulated→Physical→Transcendent) IS the A4 pipeline at civilizational timescale. Stage-Modal alignment is already axiomatic. |
| Tri-helical synchronization (Technological/Instructor/Student) | CANON-34110 | NATIVE | COMMUNITY:Ring4 / A2 | Three-capacity synchronization is A2 applied to pedagogical deployment: all three must have adequate capacity before next stage advances. |
| Technology Stage 1 (AI fluency) as universal prerequisite | CANON-34110 | SEED | COMMUNITY:Ring4 / A2 | AI fluency as gate is A2 operationalized at community scale: without this capacity, subsequent stages are blocked. Already implicit axiom. |
| MASTERY SYLLABUS — specific tool versions (Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, etc.) | CANON-34120 | ADMINISTRATIVE | WORK:Ring3 | Tool-specific, version-dated content. Update rhythm (6-12 months) acknowledges its own perishability. Structure is NATIVE; specific tool names are ADMINISTRATIVE. |
| Update rhythm philosophy (tool recs 6-12mo, curriculum 18-36mo) | CANON-34120 | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A3 | Differential update cadence enforces A3: stable schema (curriculum structure) vs. perishable cache (tool names). |
| WISDOM Chain — emerges last from all chains | CANON-35000 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A4 | WISDOM as terminal synthesis is A4 at its highest integration: verify that all traversals cohere into something beyond their sum. Already axiomatic in the 4-axiom structure. |
| TRANSCENDENCE Ring/σ — contains entire system | CANON-35100 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A1 | Quintessence element / Strategic Harmony / harmonic resonance management is A1 at meta level: preventing destructive interference between chains is coherence preservation for the whole system. |
| Five Degrees of Meta-Cognitive Integration | CANON-35110 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A4+A1 | Mirrors Coherence's Five Degrees (A4) but oriented vertically (ascending integration) rather than horizontally. Both patterns derive. First-Person/Third-Person/Non-Dual Meta maps to A1's "remaining oneself" at increasing abstraction layers. |
| Universal Energy State Topology (Peak/Baseline/Depletion/Crisis) | CANON-35120 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | This IS A2 made explicit and measurable. The four-state model is the operational core of "Capacity Before Intelligence." Already the most direct named instantiation of A2 in the canon. |
| "AuDHD lens reveals universal human variation" | CANON-35120 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | The claim that neurodivergent adaptations serve all practitioners is A2's generalization: capacity constraints are universal, not edge cases. Already a core philosophical stake. |
| "Frameworks serve practitioners, not vice versa" | CANON-35120 | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | This IS A2's corollary: if a framework consumes more capacity than it returns, it violates A2. Already core. |
| AuDHD Implementation Patterns (Spiky profile, Knowing-Doing gap, Broken fuel gauge) | CANON-35121 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | Specific patterns (akrasia amplified, energy perception dysregulation, RSD) are named failure modes of A2 under neurodivergent conditions. Justice sensitivity and stimming as regulatory tools derive from A2's optimization logic. |
| GAIAN FIELD NODE — self-sufficient regenerative infrastructure | CANON-35200 | NATIVE | WORLD:Ring5 / A3+A4 | Field Node is A3 (sovereignty) instantiated physically: repo-ground-truth extended to physical infrastructure. A4's verify stage at civilization scale: intent traversal complete only when embodied in built form. |
| Network scaling (1→5-8→20-30→50-100 nodes over 20 years) | CANON-35200 | NATIVE | WORLD:Ring5 / A4 | Replication via open-source documentation is A4's verify pattern: the pipeline is proven when others can traverse it independently. |
| Capital range ($800K-$1.8M) | CANON-35200 | ADMINISTRATIVE | WORLD:Ring5 | Point-in-time financial estimate. The scaling logic is NATIVE; the specific capital figure is perishable. |
| METAHUMANISM FRAMEWORK — Six Parts | CANON-35210 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A1 | Philosophical substrate for remaining-oneself (A1) at maximum depth. The six parts (Belief Systems, Epistemic Stratigraphy, Volition, Spiritual Planes, Causation, Essentia) collectively define what "self" is that one is preserving. |
| Epistemic Stratigraphy (12 strata: Sensory→Integral) | CANON-35210 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A1+A4 | Strata map the full territory of A4's capture layer: what types of knowing exist that the pipeline must traverse. |
| Volition Framework (Frankfurt hierarchy, 5 stages) | CANON-35210 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A2 | Frankfurt's hierarchy of desires maps directly to A2: first-order desires consume capacity; meta-volition manages what desires to have. Capacity before intelligence starts here. |
| Philosophical foundation derived LAST (bottom of tree, not top) | CANON-35210 (pattern) | SEED | SELF:Ring1 / A4 | The inversion (foundation emerges from practice, not vice versa) IS A4's epistemology: value crystallizes through traversal, not through prior declaration. Already structural axiom. |
| Pattern: Five Degrees reused across Coherence and Transcendence lunar systems | CANON-32110, 35110 | NATIVE | SELF:Ring1 / A4 | The Five Degrees (Recognition→Transmission) is a reusable A4 traversal template applicable at any domain depth. The pattern generalizes; likely extends to remaining chains. |
| Pattern: Four-Stage trajectories structurally parallel across all chains | All chain files | SEED | AGENCY:Ring2 / A4 | Parallel four-stage structure with multigenerational evidence at Stage 4 is A4's verify layer made universal: teaching-others IS the pipeline's terminal proof. |
| Pattern: Satellite files contain operational specifics; lunar/planetary hold ontological content | Meta-pattern | NATIVE | AGENCY:Ring2 / A3 | Ontology-praxis separation enforces A3 (schema is sovereign) while allowing perishable data (satellite) to be updated without touching evergreen structure. |
| Pattern: Modal Sequence as temporal backbone (Abstract→Simulated→Physical→Transcendent) | 34110, 35200, 32120 | SEED | WORLD:Ring5 / A4 | Modal Sequence IS A4 at civilizational timescale: each modal epoch is a full pipeline pass at greater instantiation depth. Already implicit in all four axioms. |

## Section C — GAPS FILE Analysis

Each identified gap is classified against the 4 axioms or flagged OPEN for Phase 3.

| Gap | Source | Addressed By Axiom? | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------------------|-------|
| INT-1701: Progressive Disclosure (4-layer vault traversal) | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Context-loading as formal access pattern has no A1-A4 derivation. A4 touches it but doesn't formalize it as an ontology verb. Flag for V2 object taxonomy. |
| INT-1702: Judgment Engineering as Service | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Encoded judgment as computable governance derives from A3 (repo sovereignty) but the computable layer isn't specified in the axioms. Requires new construct. |
| INT-1703: Attention as Post-Labor Currency | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A1+A2 | A1 names attention as the scarce coherence resource; A2 names capacity as the binding constraint. The economics framing is an extension, not a gap. T1 (σ₀ Bottleneck) covers this. |
| INT-1704: Anti-Tool-Shaped-Object Discipline | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A2 | A2 (Capacity Before Intelligence) entails: tools must cost less capacity than they return. The "gate before tool" heuristic derives directly. Not a new axiom; needs formalization as A2 corollary. |
| INT-1705: Instruction→Skill→Hook maturity ladder | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Graduation pathway for operational primitives is not present in A1-A4. A4 traversal implies maturity staging but not a named 3-rung ladder. Add to action type taxonomy. |
| INT-1706: Data Layer Sovereignty | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A3 | A3 (Sovereignty Invariant: repo = ground truth, all else = cache) covers data asset sovereignty. Ontological Asset class is an implementation gap, not an axiom gap. |
| INT-1707: Three-Layer Memory Architecture (KG + Daily Notes + Tacit) | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A3+A4 | A3 (schema sovereignty) + A4 (pipeline: capture→distill→model) together imply a tripartite memory architecture. The synthesis framing is OPEN as a named construct; axioms address it partially. |
| INT-1708: Research→NotebookLM pipeline automation | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A4 | 14-step pipeline is A4 traversal made explicit. Gap is implementation, not axiomatic. Pipeline object type is OPEN for Phase 3 object taxonomy. |
| INT-1709: Security as existential constraint | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | OPEN (Phase 3) | None of A1-A4 address threat surfaces, credential exposure, or security boundaries. Security is a genuine axiom gap. Recommend A5 or a security corollary to A3. |
| INT-1711: Agent Vault = Human-Agent Shared Knowledge Graph | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A3 | Vault-as-ground-truth derives from A3. The shared-object framing is OPEN: A3 doesn't specify multi-party read/write semantics. Phase 3 object type needed. |
| INT-1712: Perimeter = capability, not network | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Capability-boundary perimeter model is not derivable from A1-A4. Related to security gap (INT-1709). Linked to A5 need. |
| INT-1801: Token Economics Dispatch | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A2 | Budget/quota as action mediators derive from A2: capacity constraint applies to compute tokens as directly as to human attention. Gap is formalization, not axiomatic absence. |
| INT-1802: Model Role Specialization (Tier 1–4) | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A2+A4 | Intelligence Tiering is A2 (right capacity for right task) + A4 (route through appropriate pipeline layer). Formalization as governance object is OPEN for Phase 3. |
| INT-1804: Antifragile Agent Infrastructure | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A4 | Self-healing = successful A4 traversal even under failure conditions (verify triggers recovery, not shutdown). Derives from A4. State transition model is OPEN. |
| INT-P017: File-First principle | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A3 | "Plain markdown outperforms specialized memory infrastructure" (ClawVault 74.0% vs 68.5%) supports A3: the simplest sovereign substrate wins. Tension with SQLite-first V1 is real and must be resolved in V2. OPEN as explicit stance. |
| INT-P018: Supersede, Never Delete | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A3 | A3 (repo as ground truth) entails immutable history: supersession preserves epistemic lineage; deletion destroys it. Derives from A3. Conflicts with V1 Purge permission — formalization conflict, not axiom gap. |
| INT-P019: Security as Binding Constraint | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | OPEN (Phase 3) | 200+ exposed instances confirm this is load-bearing, not aspirational. Same gap as INT-1709. Reinforces A5 need. |
| INT-P020: Verbatim Trap Test | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A4 | Synthesis must produce connections/tensions NOT already present in source (A4:distill requires genuine compression, not restatement). Derives from A4. Meta-gap, not object-type gap. |
| INT-P021: Knowledge-Code Isomorphism | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A3+A4 | Vault index = skill discovery = ontological surface derives from A3 (vault is ground truth) + A4 (vault as the pipeline's model layer). OPEN as named architectural stance. |
| INT-P022: Constellation pattern is emergent consensus | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Competitive positioning (moat analysis) has no derivation from A1-A4. Requires external-facing strategic axiom. Phase 3 context layer. |
| INT-P024: Intelligence Tiering | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A2 | Same as INT-1802. Derives from A2; formalization OPEN. |
| INT-P025: Agent Auto-Recovery | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §1 | A4 | Same as INT-1804. Derives from A4. |
| Narrative DNA (StarCraft/Dune/Halo taxonomy) absent from V1 | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §2 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Narrative frameworks provide architectural vocabulary, not axiomatic derivations. Phase 3 contextual layer. Dune Spice/attention-scarcity maps to A2 metaphorically; metaphor ≠ derivation. |
| Frontier Landscape / Competitive Context absent from V1 | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §3 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Gastown, Anthropic Hivemind, moat analysis are strategic context, not derivable from A1-A4. Phase 3 context layer needed. |
| DC-002: Skills security audit (credential exfiltration risk) | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §4 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Security domain absent from axioms. P0-CRITICAL. |
| DC-003: Plaintext key rotation | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §4 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Credential object type + governance lifecycle absent from A1-A4. P0-CRITICAL. |
| DC-004: ~25 pending Rosetta Stone ontological terms | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §4 | OPEN (Phase 3) | Highest-leverage gap. Terms are "intellectually resolved" but not committed. May add entire object categories before V2 taxonomy is finalized. P0. |
| DC-005: Agent fleet reliability sub-states | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §4 | A2 | Agent health beyond binary up/down derives from A2: reliability IS a capacity dimension. Formalization OPEN. |
| DC-006: Configured vs Operational state distinction | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §4 | A4 | Configured = intent captured; Operational = activated. The A4 pipeline's activate gate covers this distinction. Formalization OPEN. |
| DC-010: Live Ledger sensing pipeline | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §4 | A4 | Sensing pipeline is A4's capture layer made executable. SensingTask object type OPEN for Phase 3. |
| DC-011: Annotation/enrichment as action type | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §4 | A4 | Enrich/Annotate/PromoteStatus are A4 distill-layer verbs. Derivation present; formalization OPEN. |
| DC-012: Promotion action type lacks enforcement trigger | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §4 | A4+A3 | 17% delivery rate reveals A4's verify gate is unenforceable. A3 (repo sovereignty) requires commit-backed verification. Formalization OPEN. |
| Four-Systems Intake Architecture absent from V1 | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §5 | A4 | Automatic-Push / Curation-Push / On-Demand-Pull / Triage are the four modes of A4's capture layer. Full derivation from A4; object types OPEN for Phase 3. |
| Token Economics as first-class domain | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §6 | A2 | Budget/quota/tiering derive from A2 (capacity constraint applied to compute resources). Domain is absent from V1 as formalized objects; axiom coverage is present. P0 formalization gap. |
| Three-Layer Memory synthesis (KG + Daily Notes + Tacit) | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §7 | A3+A4 | Partially addressed above (INT-1707). Vault-as-Agent-Memory framing is the missing named construct. OPEN for Phase 3. |
| Security Domain entirely absent from V1 | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §8 | OPEN (Phase 3) | A1-A4 do not address threat surfaces. Represents the largest single axiom gap. Recommend: A5 (Security Invariant) or a Theorem T4 (Perimeter = Capability) derived as security corollary of A3. P0. |
| Cline/OpenCode as Tier 4 (INT-1803) | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §9 | A2 | Free/low-cost models for housekeeping = A2 applied to infrastructure: use the cheapest sufficient capacity. Tier classification OPEN for Phase 3 agent taxonomy. |
| HighCommand / Agendizer as existing ontology substrate | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §10 | A3 | A3 (repo = ground truth) prohibits reinventing what already exists. HighCommand audit is required before new kernel build. OPEN: reconciliation action, not axiom gap. |
| FDIS as Gaian Field Node engineering precursor | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS §11 | A4 | FDIS is A4's modal-transition artifact: the pipeline stage before Field Node becomes the verify target. OPEN as named construct; Phase 3. |
| V1 vs INT-P017 (File-First vs SQLite) misalignment | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS, Misalignments §1 | A3 | A3 (sovereignty invariant) favors the substrate with highest ground-truth fidelity. ClawVault data suggests markdown. Tension is real and must be explicitly resolved in V2, not inherited. |
| V1 Purge vs INT-P018 Supersede conflict | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS, Misalignments §2 | A3 | A3 derivation favors Supersede: deleting from ground truth destroys epistemic lineage. V1 governance table must be corrected. Axiom resolves the conflict; governance table needs update. |
| V1 Kernel-first vs INT-1612 Automations-now tension | ANNEAL-DIGEST-GAPS, Misalignments §3 | A2+A4 | A2 says build the capacity layer before deploying intelligence; A4 says crystallization only happens through traversal. The tension is productive: answer is incremental kernel build alongside activation, not sequential. OPEN as explicit architectural decision. |

## Summary: Genuine Axiom Gaps (Open for Phase 3)

The following gaps are NOT addressable by A1–A4 and require new constructs in Phase 3:

| Gap | Recommended Action |
|-----|--------------------|
| Security Domain (INT-1709, INT-1712, INT-P019, DC-002, DC-003) | Propose A5 (Security Invariant) or T4 (Perimeter = Capability, derived from A3) |
| Competitive Positioning / Moat Analysis | Phase 3 context layer; not axiom-derivable |
| Narrative DNA integration | Phase 3 vocabulary layer; metaphors support but don't derive from axioms |
| Progressive Disclosure as formal access pattern (INT-1701) | Phase 3 object type: ContextAccessProtocol |
| Judgment Engineering as computable governance (INT-1702) | Phase 3 object type: EncodedJudgment |
| Instruction→Skill→Hook maturity ladder (INT-1705) | Phase 3 action type taxonomy addition |
| DC-004 (~25 Rosetta Stone terms) | Must enumerate before Phase 3 taxonomy finalized; highest-leverage gap |
