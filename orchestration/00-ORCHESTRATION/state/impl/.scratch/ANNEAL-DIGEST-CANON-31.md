### Cluster 2: Platform Sovereignty
Files: 31110, 31130, 31142, 31143

## Notable Patterns

1. **Operational Status uniformly "partial"**: All 31xxx files carry `operational_status: partial` (except 31121/31122 which are "theoretical"). The v2.3 IIC integration is architecturally specified but not fully enacted — design-complete, execution-pending.

2. **Triadic structure throughout**: Seven-Layer Stack (7 layers), Three Cognitive Modes (Aesthetic/Empirical/Strategic), Guiding Virtue triads per IIC, Three-Layer integration frameworks. Three-and-seven recur as organizing numbers.

3. **Auto-generation as canonical pattern**: CANON-31150 is machine-generated from JSON via Python script — establishing a precedent for metabolic separation between temporal data and evergreen structure. Noted explicitly as "demonstrating the metabolic pattern."

4. **Dual-origin files**: All 13 canonical files exist in both `/canon/` and `/canon/sn/` (Semantic Notation mirror). The `sn/` versions appear to be identical content — possibly pre-processed or notation-annotated copies.

5. **Modal Sequence arc embedded**: 31100 explicitly maps Stack sophistication to Modal Sequence (Modal 1: Abstraction 2024-2026, Modal 2: Simulation 2027-2030, Modal 3: Embodiment 2031-2036, Modal 4: Transcendence 2037+). The 31xxx range is squarely Modal 1 infrastructure.

6. **Falsification criteria embedded**: Multiple files (31120, 31122) include explicit falsification criteria — e.g., "This TONE LIBRARY fails if production doesn't accelerate." Empirical approach to framework validity.

7. **Neo-Bloomberg Terminal metaphor**: The Acumen IIC is consistently framed as a "Neo-Bloomberg Terminal for Syncrescendent Intelligence" — signals the civilizational ambition of what is structurally a personal intelligence feed system.

8. **Guardrails as constitutional law**: The prohibition on philosophical maximalism ("cosmic emanations," "species transformation") is enforced at both the TONE LIBRARY level (Guardrail 05) and Rhetorical Calibration level. Groundedness is explicitly constitutional, not aspirational.

9. **Version 2.0.0 across the board**: All files show `version: 2.0.0`, `updated: 2025-12-30` — suggesting a synchronized canonical refresh in late December 2025 that unified formatting and schema.

10. **CANON-31115 classification ambiguity**: Its frontmatter classifies it as `lunar` and its header calls it a "supplement" (non-canonical), yet it is filed in the CANON directory and has a CANON ID. Operational supplement elevated to canonical status through integration.
