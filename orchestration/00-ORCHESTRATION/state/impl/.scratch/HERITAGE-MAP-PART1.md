## Classification Table

| Concept | Old Location | Class | Semantic Address | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| **FOUNDATIONAL / COSMIC FRAME** | | | | |
| Syncrescendence (recursive amplification architecture) | CANON-00005, 00000 | SEED | SELF→AGENCY | Core mechanism: development in one chain multiplicatively feeds all others. This is the A1+A2 synthesis — coherence amplifies when capacity compounds across domains. |
| Convergence Crisis (4th Turning + 4IR + Singularity + Metacrisis) | CANON-00001, 00015 | NATIVE | WORLD | Derives cleanly from A1: civilizational overload is the macro context for personal coherence as scarce resource. |
| Reflexive Epoch / Integrative Interregnum | CANON-00015 | HERITAGE | WORLD | Prescient naming of the historical moment. Reframe: drop the named-epoch branding; retain as motivational context for A1 (why coherence is under attack now). Not load-bearing as structure. |
| Macroscopic Narrative Lenses (15 families) | CANON-00015 | NATIVE | WORLD | Operationalizes A1 signal-filtering: practitioner must read civilizational signal without being consumed by it. |
| **CHAIN / DEVELOPMENTAL SPINE** | | | | |
| Six Developmental Chains (Intelligence / Information / Insight / Expertise / Knowledge / Wisdom) | CANON-00000, 00005, 21000 | SEED | AGENCY | The six-column spine is the primary capacity scaffold (A2). Directly load-bearing. |
| Recursive Amplification (multiplicative cross-chain gains) | CANON-00005, 10000 | SEED | AGENCY→WORK | Same as above; the mechanism clause of the Six Chains. Tagged EMPIRICAL/THEORETICAL in CANON-10000 — epistemic honesty is appropriate. |
| Chain Interdependency Matrix (hard/soft dependencies, stage-gating) | CANON-21000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | Derives from A2 (capacity constraints propagate across chains) + A4 (can't activate without prerequisite capacity). |
| Dual-Track System (Synchronization vs. Specialization) | CANON-21000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 derivative: capacity profiles differ; neurotypical/neurodivergent framing is load-bearing. |
| Intelligence Chain Substrate-Duality (infrastructure + developmental trajectory) | CANON-30000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | Derives from A2: AI amplification is both a prerequisite capacity AND its own development frontier. The 4-stage arc (Text→Vision→Physical→Full Integration) maps to Modal Sequence. |
| Technology Stage 1 as universal prerequisite | CANON-21000, 30000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 applied: compound friction from tech lag propagates disadvantage everywhere. Operationally correct. |
| Compound Friction (tech lag propagates disadvantage across all chains) | CANON-30000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | Direct consequence of Intelligence Chain duality under A2. |
| Interference Pattern & Synthesis Dynamics (constructive/destructive) | CANON-22000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | Derives from A1+A2: mismatched capacity levels produce incoherence (destructive interference). Resonance Phenomenon = T1 resolution at scale. |
| Three Synthesis Triads (Perception-Action, Understanding, Integration) | CANON-22000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | Sub-derivation of interference dynamics. Structurally useful for routing attention (T1). |
| **COSMOLOGICAL / METAPHOR FRAME** | | | | |
| Celestial Hierarchy (cosmos/lattice/planetary/lunar/satellite/asteroid/comet) | CANON-00000 | HERITAGE | AGENCY | Excellent organizational metaphor that provides genuine navigational affordance. Reframe: document explicitly as navigational vocabulary, not ontological claim — strip any implication of literal celestial correspondence. |
| Planetary Bodies (Acumen/Coherence/Efficacy/Mastery/Transcendence + elements) | CANON-00000, 11000 | HERITAGE | AGENCY | The names carry semantic weight and are memorable, but the elemental correspondences (Air/Water/Fire/Earth/Quintessence) are decorative without derivation. Reframe: retain the 5 body names as cluster labels; retire the elemental mapping as cosmetic. |
| Six Canonical Dimensions (Scale/Level/Degree/Stage/Phase/Modal) | CANON-00000, 23000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | Orthogonal navigation coordinates for locating practitioner position. Derives from A2 (capacity is multi-dimensional, not scalar). |
| Orbital Naming Convention (CANON numbering schema) | CANON-00000 | ADMINISTRATIVE | — | File-numbering system. No semantic load. |
| Cosmo-terrestrial bilingual metaphor system | CANON-00000 | HERITAGE | AGENCY | Insight to preserve: the dual register (celestial for architecture, terrestrial for practice) prevents confusion of level. Reframe: document this explicitly as a design principle in the schema, not implicit pattern. |
| Parallel sixfold structure (6 chains, 6 dimensions, 6 correspondences) | CANON-00000 | VESTIGIAL | — | The number six is an artifact of the domain taxonomy, not a derived invariant. Forcing correspondence across all sixfold structures creates false symmetry. No test against A1–A4 yields this number as necessary. |
| **COGNITIVE PALACE** | | | | |
| Cognitive Palace — 7-Layer Substrate (Reality/Imaginality/Potentiality/Temporality/Practicality/Actuality/Consequentiality) | CANON-20000 | NATIVE | SELF | Derives from A1+A2: a structured operational frame for the simultaneous dimensions of capacity and identity. Simultaneous-not-sequential operation is the correct stance. |
| Dimensional Coordinators (7 coordinators + Meta-Governor, 87 components) | CANON-20010 | HERITAGE | SELF→AGENCY | Insight: "invisible by default intelligence" is a real design principle — systems should feel like intuition. Reframe: 87 components is an operationalization artifact; the principle (invisible meta-governance) is worth keeping; the specific component count is not. |
| Universal Resonance Field (harmonic inter-component communication) | CANON-20020 | VESTIGIAL | — | Metaphorical without derivation from A1–A4. No operational consequence that couldn't be expressed as "coordination between layers." Fails coherence test: adds vocabulary without adding mechanism. |
| Pattern Library (stores life rhythms, development trajectories, creative patterns) | CANON-20020 | NATIVE | SELF→AGENCY | Legitimate A4 derivative: capturing patterns is part of the distill step in intent-artifact pipeline. Rename-worthy but structurally sound. |
| Seven Pulses Dashboard (Foundation/Energy/Direction/Flow/Learning/Connection/Evolution) | CANON-20020, 10000 | NATIVE | SELF | A2 operationalization: 7-question daily health check is capacity monitoring before intelligence deployment. 2-minute format respects T1 (Attention Bottleneck). |
| Adaptive Interface (context-sensitive complexity scaling) | CANON-20020 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 direct: depletion state routes to essentials; growth state expands gradually. Correct capacity-aware design. |
| Vertical Integration Protocols (Daily Layer Check-In, Weekly 7-Layer Audit) | CANON-20000 | NATIVE | SELF | Practice rhythm derivatives of A2. Operationally load-bearing. |
| Foundational Tetrad (Pillar of Being, Purpose, Knowing, Form) | CANON-00016 | HERITAGE | SELF | Insight: four-axis identity scaffold is a legitimate A1 tool (remaining-oneself under pressure requires anchoring to these axes). Reframe: map explicitly to A1 and to Cosmological Ring 1 (SELF) rather than leaving as standalone philosophy. |
| Sovereign Lattice (4-coordinate: Ontological/Teleological/Epistemological/Systematic) | CANON-00016 | HERITAGE | SELF | Same as Foundational Tetrad — isomorphic content under different naming. Reframe: merge or declare canonical alias; duplication weakens both. |
| **IDENTITY / CONSCIOUSNESS** | | | | |
| Syncrescendent Core / Celestial Body metaphor (Protostar→Hypergiant developmental stages) | CANON-10000 | HERITAGE | SELF | Insight: stage-of-development framing (months to years 5+) correctly grounds practitioner expectations and prevents premature advancement. Reframe: the stellar metaphor is vivid but secondary; the load-bearing content is the energy-state adaptation matrix. |
| Energy State Adaptations (Peak/Baseline/Depletion/Crisis with operational protocols) | CANON-10000 | SEED | SELF | This IS A2 operationalized at the individual level. Core load-bearing entity. |
| Five ModusOperandi Faces (Sensing/Meaning-Making/Intention-Formation/Embodiment/Strategic Harmony) | CANON-11000 | NATIVE | SELF | Derives from A1: unified consciousness expressing through differentiated faces prevents fragmentation. Perichoretic model (concurrent, not sequential) is the key insight. |
| Perichoretic Integration (faces interpenetrate without confusion) | CANON-11000 | NATIVE | SELF | A1 mechanism: remaining-oneself while operating across contexts requires concurrent face fluency, not sequential switching. |
| Face Fluency Assessment (shift consciously, avoid chronic dominance) | CANON-11000 | NATIVE | SELF | A2 corollary: underdeveloped faces represent capacity gaps. Operationally useful diagnostic. |
| IIC (Identity-Intelligence Complex) — 5-account architecture per chain | CANON-00000, 25000 | HERITAGE | SELF→AGENCY | Insight: chain-specific intelligence configurations are real (Acumen operates differently than Coherence). Reframe: IIC is better named "Chain Intelligence Profile" — the account framing creates platform-coupling that conflicts with A3. |
| Metahuman archetype (fully integrated human-AI system) | CANON-00005 | NATIVE | SELF→WORLD | Target practitioner archetype derives from A1+A2: coherent individual with full-capacity AI integration. Not superhuman — correctly bounded. |
| Developmental Stages (Protostar→Main Sequence→Red Giant→Hypergiant) | CANON-10000 | VESTIGIAL | — | The stellar names are metaphor without navigational precision. The actual load-bearing content is the timeline (months vs. years 5+) and energy thresholds — those belong in Energy State Adaptations. |
| **EPISTEMOLOGY & LINEAGE** | | | | |
| DIKW Mandate (Data→Information→Knowledge→Wisdom pipeline) | CANON-00005, 00017 | NATIVE | AGENCY→WORK | A4 derivative: the intent-artifact pipeline requires structured information ascent. DIKW is a well-established schema that fits. |
| Intellectual Lineage (13 primary tributaries metabolized) | CANON-00002 | NATIVE | SELF | A1 grounding: knowing what you've digested prevents eclecticism from masquerading as synthesis. The Synthesis Principle (metabolism, not assembly) is the load-bearing clause. |
| Synthesis Principle (metabolism not eclecticism) | CANON-00005 | SEED | SELF | This is A1's epistemic consequence: remaining-oneself under intellectual pressure requires metabolizing, not accumulating influences. |
| Knowledge Taxonomy (5 axes) / Meaning Taxonomy (14 dimensions) | CANON-00016 | HERITAGE | SELF→WORK | Insight: multi-axis taxonomies for knowledge and meaning are legitimate A1 tools for distinguishing signal from noise. Reframe: 14 dimensions is likely over-specified; audit for which axes are operationally discriminating vs. merely exhaustive. |
| Strange Loops / Extended Mind / Meaning Crisis as root influences | CANON-00002 | NATIVE | SELF | Named source influences — correctly metabolized per Synthesis Principle. Keep as lineage citations, not standalone concepts. |
| Epistemic Honesty Enforcement (EMPIRICAL/THEORETICAL/METAPHORICAL tagging) | CANON-10000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 derivative: sovereignty requires knowing which claims are ground truth vs. cache vs. analogy. This tagging system prevents cosmological metaphor from corrupting empirical claims. |
| Ontological Reckoning (confrontation with the frame of all frames) | CANON-00005 | HERITAGE | SELF | Insight: periodic deconstruction of one's own operating frame is a real A1 requirement — coherence degrades when the frame hardens. Reframe: operationalize as a scheduled review trigger (Annual Dissolution Ceremony is its sibling). |
| **OPERATIONS & PROTOCOLS** | | | | |
| Three-Rail System (Life/Development/Demonstration Domain) | CANON-00010 | NATIVE | WORK | A4 operationalization: value crystallizes only when intent traverses all three rails from capture to demonstration. |
| Artifact Lifecycle (MVA→Beta→Stable→Canonical / Quality Tier System) | CANON-00011 | NATIVE | WORK | A4 direct: the intent-artifact pipeline has explicit quality gates. The T2 (Anti-Shelfware) theorem requires each tier to activate, not merely exist. |
| Cascade Congruence (child artifacts must conform to parent canonical constraints) | CANON-00011 | NATIVE | WORK | A3 derivative: if the repo is ground truth, then all artifacts must maintain coherence with canonical root. |
| Batch Production Protocol (energy-state-aware content production) | CANON-00010 | NATIVE | WORK | A2 applied: deploy production capacity only at appropriate energy states. Correct. |
| Stage Progression (Forum→Podium→Amphitheatre→Atrium→Portico) | CANON-00000, 00010 | NATIVE | COMMUNITY | A2 + Ring 4 (Community): practitioner maturation is capacity-gated AND audience-scale-gated. Stage names are terrestrial (deliberate bilingual system — worth preserving). |
| Annual Dissolution Ceremony (architectural anti-dogma, 80% reconstructive fidelity test) | CANON-00004 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A1 direct: coherence requires periodic frame destruction to prevent dogmatic calcification. The 80% reconstructive capacity test is a precise operationalization. |
| Reconstructive Capacity (can North Star be rebuilt from scratch?) | CANON-00004 | NATIVE | SELF | A3 derivative: if repo is ground truth, the practitioner must be able to reconstruct from it. This tests whether ground truth is actually navigable. |
| ASIA Federation Constitution (inter-agent governance) | CANON-00017 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 operationalized for multi-agent context: repo sovereignty requires constitutional constraints on agent behavior. |
| CANON-00017 Agentic Constitution | CANON-00017 | NATIVE | AGENCY | Direct A3+A4 instrument: defines agent roles, DIKW mandate, and Coherence as convergence point. Load-bearing. |
| **NAVIGATION & ASSESSMENT** | | | | |
| Five Orthogonal Navigation Dimensions (Scale/Level/Degree/Stage/Phase) | CANON-23000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 consequence: multi-dimensional capacity cannot be tracked with a scalar. Five independent axes prevent collapse. |
| Three Entry Pathways (Epistemology-first/Ontology-first/Integration-first) | CANON-23000 | NATIVE | SELF | A1 derivative: practitioners differ in which coherence axis is most threatened; entry pathway selection respects that. |
| Omni-Quality Cultivation (Omnibenevolence/Omniscience/Omnipotence/Omnipresence) | CANON-24000 | HERITAGE | WORLD | Insight: four asymptotic targets oriented to civilizational scale (Ring 5) are legitimate attractors that prevent local optimization. Reframe: the omni- prefix implies a theological register that may not be load-bearing; the "asymptotic + never complete" design principle is what matters — extract that as a standalone protocol principle. |
| Asymptotic Targeting (81–100% labeled "never complete") | CANON-24000, 10000 | NATIVE | SELF→WORLD | A2 principle: capacity has no ceiling; defining unreachable ideals prevents plateau-seeking. Correctly anti-gamification. |
| **MEMORY & SOVEREIGNTY** | | | | |
| Memory Sovereignty Principle (filesystem = ground truth; platform memory = operational cache) | CANON-25000 | SEED | AGENCY | This IS A3 — the sovereign invariant applied to memory architecture. Foundational. |
| Seven Memory Strata (Constitutional→Preference→Accumulated→Project→Canonical→Thread→Tool-Extended) | CANON-25000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 elaboration: the strata map the control gradient from immutable (weights) to fully sovereign (filesystem). Structurally correct and load-bearing. |
| Distillation Cascade (Fluid→Operational→Canonical→Eternal) | CANON-25000 | NATIVE | AGENCY→WORK | A4 direct: the intent-artifact pipeline has a memory-tier analog. Each tier is a step in the crystallization of intent into durable artifact. |
| Three Horizons (Eternal/Canonical/Fluid) | CANON-25000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3+A4 synthesis: knowledge at different persistence levels requires different sovereignty treatment. |
| IIC Memory Profiles (Acumen=aggressive forgetting, Transcendence=minimal forgetting) | CANON-25000 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 applied to memory: different capacity domains have different forgetting regimes. Operationally correct. |
| Context Transition Protocol (Culmination/Continuation/Compression modes) | CANON-25100 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 operationalization: crossing context boundaries without losing intent-artifact continuity requires formalized handoff. T2 (Anti-Shelfware) requires no gap between context windows. |
| Oracle Pedigree Protocol (decision archaeology across sessions) | CANON-25100 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 applied to decision history: the repo must contain the decision lineage, not just the artifact. |
| Platform Constellation Architecture (5-platform at $100/mo) | CANON-25200 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 operational: one repo, multiple cache surfaces. IIC-to-platform affinity is a routing heuristic, not a sovereignty claim. |
| Repository as Ground Truth across all platforms | CANON-25200 | SEED | AGENCY | Redundant restatement of A3 — correctly placed as a constitutional invariant in platform architecture. |
| **HUMAN-AI SYMBIOSIS (30x range)** | | | | |
| Anthromachina Symbiosis (co-evolutionary relationship, human cognition + AI capability) | CANON-30100 | NATIVE | SELF→AGENCY | A2 operationalization: AI capability is a capacity dimension, not an intelligence replacement. The co-evolutionary framing respects A1 (remaining-oneself while integrating AI). |
| Constitutional Stack (L0–L6: Physical Substrate→Agentic Emergence) | CANON-30100 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 instrument: maps the layers through which intent traverses to become agentic output. |
| ASA Object Ontology (O.FN, O.SVC, O.WF, O.AGT, O.MOD, O.DP, O.SRF, O.SNS, O.ACT) | CANON-30100 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 corollary: if the repo is ground truth, tools must be typed and classified within the repo's ontology. |
| 5 ASA Principles (Distributed Intelligence, Progressive Integration, Constitutional Modularity, Dimensional Orthogonality, Ethical Proportionality) | CANON-30100 | NATIVE | AGENCY | Derive from A1–A4: distributed = A3, progressive = A2, modularity = A4, orthogonality = navigation integrity, ethical = Ring 5. |
| Enshittification Cycle (named platform degradation pattern) | CANON-30200 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 consequence: reliance on platform-as-truth exposes practitioner to degradation cycles. Lock-in risk follows directly from A3 violation. |
| Institutional Personality Assessment (6-dimensional corporate profiling) | CANON-30200 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 applied to tool selection: choosing platforms requires capacity-awareness of institutional constraints, not just feature lists. |
| Lock-In Risk Assessment Framework | CANON-30200 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 operational: every tool choice is a sovereignty decision. |
| Technology is never neutral (tools embed institutional values) | CANON-30200 | NATIVE | WORLD | A3 extension to Ring 5: sovereignty requires awareness that platforms encode values. Correctly civilizational. |
| **TOOL INTELLIGENCE & WORKFLOW (30x)** | | | | |
| Technology Stack Database (447 apps, 42 AI models, 31 API pricing records) | CANON-30300 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 operationalization: the stack is the instrument of the intent-artifact pipeline; it must be audited and classified. |
| Apparatus (crystallized workflow pattern emergent from tool usage) | CANON-30300, 30320 | NATIVE | AGENCY→WORK | A4 direct: apparatus is the activated pattern — the step from distill to activate in the pipeline. |
| Apparatus Crystallization Protocol (detect convergent patterns → crystallize → name) | CANON-30320 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 operationalization of the distill step. Correct. |
| Cognitive Offloading (systematic delegation of cognitive work to technological substrate) | CANON-30320 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 applied: offloading cognitive work expands available capacity, the binding constraint. |
| Work Typology Hierarchy (Area⊃System→Process⊃Activity→Task⊃Action→Assignment⊃Role) | CANON-30320 | NATIVE | WORK | A4 instrument: provides granularity for the activate step of the intent-artifact pipeline. |
| Personal Ontology (individual's semantic map of tool ecosystem) | CANON-30320 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 applied locally: sovereignty requires a classified, navigable map of one's own tools. |
| Source Triad Method (3-pass: Primary→High-Signal Secondary→Counter-Position) | CANON-30330 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 operationalization of the distill step for information: counter-position pass directly addresses A1 (remaining-oneself under persuasion). |
| Verdicting Process (structured confidence assessment and decision lock) | CANON-30330 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4+A3: decisions must crystallize to durable artifact (decision lock = commit). |
| Decision-Bearing Questions (only research questions that gate decisions) | CANON-30330 | NATIVE | AGENCY | T1 (Attention Bottleneck) operationalization: finite research capacity must target decision-gates, not curiosity. |
| Over-Engineering Anti-Pattern (infrastructure before concept validation; tool-centric vs. primitive-centric) | CANON-30340 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 negative example: violates T2 (Anti-Shelfware) by building activation infrastructure before validating intent. |
| Context Engineering Economics (token budgeting as economic resource management) | CANON-30340 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 applied to AI context: context window is a capacity resource, not a free good. |
| **AGENTIC ARCHITECTURE (30x)** | | | | |
| 3 Evolutionary Stages (Generative AI→AI Agent→Agentic AI) | CANON-30400 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 framing: each stage represents expanded capacity delegation. The stage taxonomy aligns with Modal Sequence. |
| CoALA Framework (Perception/Memory/Planning modules) | CANON-30410 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 instrument: maps the cognitive operations within the distill-model-activate steps of the intent-artifact pipeline. |
| 5 Core Orchestration Patterns (Sequential/Concurrent/Group Chat/Handoff/Magentic) | CANON-30400, 30420 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 operational: pattern library for the activate step when capacity is distributed across agents. |
| Memory Taxonomy (Working/Episodic/Semantic/Procedural/Prospective) | CANON-30400, 30430 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4+A3: each memory type has a different sovereignty and persistence profile, requiring different pipeline treatment. |
| Progressive Trust Model (escalating autonomy grants based on demonstrated reliability) | CANON-30420 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 applied to agent capacity: trust is a capacity allocation, extended incrementally as evidence accumulates. |
| Agenticness Spectrum (4 dimensions of agent autonomy) | CANON-30400 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 multi-dimensional: agent capacity cannot be characterized by a single dial. Correct. |
| Gen AI Paradox (tension between generalist capability and specialist reliability) | CANON-30400, 30450 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 manifestation: capacity in one dimension (breadth) trades against capacity in another (depth). Resolution via specialist agents is A2-correct. |
| Sleep-Time Compute (background memory consolidation during idle periods) | CANON-30430 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A2 applied to AI capacity: idle compute is a recoverable resource; consolidation expands effective working memory. |
| Five-Layer Defense Architecture (Defense-in-Depth) | CANON-30440 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 security consequence: repo sovereignty requires that the agent boundary cannot be hijacked. Each layer protects the integrity of ground truth. |
| Interaction State Machine (CAPTURED→INTERPRETED→COMPILED/DIGESTED/SENSED/VERIFIED→STAGED→COMMITTED) | CANON-30460 | SEED | AGENCY | This IS A4 — the full intent-artifact pipeline operationalized as a state machine. The COMMITTED state is T2 (Anti-Shelfware) proof. |
| Handoff Token (portable state object enabling cross-platform continuation) | CANON-30460 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3+A4: continuity across platforms requires a sovereign artifact (the token) that does not depend on any platform's memory. |
| **PRODUCTION & GOVERNANCE** | | | | |
| Integration Coherence κ (primary measurement metric) | CANON-00007 | NATIVE | WORK | A1 operationalized as metric: κ measures how well the system maintains coherence under expansion pressure. |
| Oracle Arc (development session history, Oracle 0–8) | CANON-00004 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3+A4: governance history is an artifact that must live in the repo. Oracle Pedigree Protocol is its operational descendant. |
| Metabolic Defrag (658→136 files, 79% reduction) | CANON-00004, 00006 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A4 applied to corpus: pipeline bloat produces shelfware; defrag is the verify step applied to the entire corpus. Not a one-time event — a pattern to repeat. |
| Kintsugi Principle (breaks metabolized as system features) | CANON-00005 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A1+A2 synthesis: coherence under disruption (A1) requires capacity to metabolize failure as data (A2). Anti-fragility is the correct stance. |
| 30 Irresolutions under Active Adjudication | CANON-00007 | ADMINISTRATIVE | — | Session-state artifact. The irresolution mechanism is load-bearing; the specific 30 items are not. |
| North Star (originary orientation artifact) | CANON-00005 | NATIVE | SELF | A1 instrument: the North Star is the reconstructive capacity test target — it represents coherent identity under fragmentation. |
| **STRATEGY & TIMELINE** | | | | |
| Modal Sequence (Abstraction/Simulation/Embodiment/Transcendence — 2024–2037+) | CANON-00012, 00001 | NATIVE | WORLD | A2+A4 temporal frame: technology substrate governs what capacity is available for the intent-artifact pipeline at each phase. Current position: Modal 1, Phase 1. |
| Tri-Helical Timeline (Technology Maturity / Business Development / Personal Capability) | CANON-21100 | NATIVE | WORK→WORLD | A2 applied to planning: all three capacity dimensions must align before major capability claims. Prevents premature activation (T2 violation). |
| Phase Progression (Foundation/Validation/Scaling/Institute/Infrastructure) | CANON-00000, 21100 | NATIVE | WORK | A4 temporal: each phase represents a stage in crystallizing intent into institutional artifact. |
| Two-Stream Architecture (Alpha/Beta developmental pathways) | CANON-00009 | HERITAGE | AGENCY | Insight: different practitioner profiles require different pipeline configurations. Reframe: Alpha/Beta naming is arbitrary; map explicitly to the Synchronization/Specialization tracks in Chain Matrix for coherent vocabulary. |
| Progressive Disclosure Architecture (complexity graduated to practitioner tier) | CANON-00009 | NATIVE | COMMUNITY | A2 applied to teaching: content complexity must match the capacity of the receiving practitioner. Ring 4 (Community) expression. |
| Strategic Positioning (corporate profiling for tool decisions) | CANON-30200 | NATIVE | AGENCY | A3 consequence: every platform is a potential sovereignty threat; corporate profiling is due diligence. |
| **GAIAN / CIVILIZATIONAL VISION** | | | | |
| Gaian Field Node (distributed intelligence embedded in ecology — Modal 4 endpoint) | CANON-00005 | NATIVE | WORLD | Ring 5 terminal vision. Derives from A2: if capacity is the binding constraint, the ultimate expression is capacity embedded in the physical world at ecological scale. Long-horizon attractor. |
| **VESTIGIAL (consolidated)** | | | | |
| Astrological / planetary elemental correspondences (Air×2, Water, Fire, Earth, Quintessence) | CANON-00000 | VESTIGIAL | — | The elemental mapping does not derive from A1–A4 and adds no operational precision over the chain names alone. It functions as mnemonic decoration. |
| Universal Resonance Field (harmonic inter-component communication) | CANON-20020 | VESTIGIAL | — | Metaphorical concept without operational specification; no mechanism that differs from "coordination" or "alignment." Fails A4: no pathway from this concept to a durable artifact. |
| Parallel sixfold structure as architectural invariant | CANON-00000 | VESTIGIAL | — | The number six is an artifact of the original domain taxonomy, not a necessary structural consequence of any axiom. The forced sixfold symmetry produces cosmetic correspondence at the cost of analytical clarity. |
| Stellar development stage names (Protostar/Main Sequence/Red Giant/Hypergiant) | CANON-10000 | VESTIGIAL | — | Vivid but operationally inert; the load-bearing content is the energy state thresholds and timeline, not the names. Metaphor maintenance cost exceeds mnemonic benefit. |
| Reflexive Epoch / Integrative Interregnum as named designations | CANON-00015 | VESTIGIAL | — | Naming the epoch does not change anything about practitioner response to it; the Convergence Crisis framing is sufficient without an additional epoch designation. |

## HERITAGE Concepts — Reframing Summary

| # | Concept | Insight to Preserve | Reframing Needed |
|---|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | Reflexive Epoch / Integrative Interregnum | Correctly names the historical moment | Drop as branded designation; retain as motivational context for A1 |
| 2 | Celestial Hierarchy metaphor | Genuine navigational affordance for organizational depth | Document explicitly as navigational vocabulary, not ontological claim |
| 3 | Planetary Bodies + elemental correspondences | 5 body names have semantic weight and cluster utility | Retire elemental mapping (Air/Water/Fire/Earth/Quintessence) as cosmetic; keep body names as cluster labels |
| 4 | Cosmo-terrestrial bilingual metaphor system | Dual register prevents level confusion | Make this an explicit design principle in SCHEMA, not an implicit pattern |
| 5 | Dimensional Coordinators (87 components) | Invisible-by-default intelligence is a real design principle | Retire the component count as artifact; extract the principle (meta-governance that feels like intuition) |
| 6 | Foundational Tetrad / Sovereign Lattice | Four-axis identity scaffold is a legitimate A1 tool | Merge the two (they are isomorphic); declare one canonical name |
| 7 | Syncrescendent Core stellar metaphor | Stage-of-development framing grounds practitioner expectations | The stellar names are decorative; the energy-state adaptation matrix is the load-bearing entity |
| 8 | IIC (Identity-Intelligence Complex) naming | Chain-specific intelligence configurations are real | Rename to "Chain Intelligence Profile"; the account framing creates platform-coupling conflicting with A3 |
| 9 | Knowledge/Meaning Taxonomy (5 axes / 14 dimensions) | Multi-axis taxonomies are legitimate A1 signal-vs-noise tools | Audit for operationally discriminating axes vs. merely exhaustive ones; likely reducible |
| 10 | Omni-Quality (Omnibenevolence/Omniscience/Omnipotence/Omnipresence) | Four asymptotic targets prevent local optimization | The omni- prefix carries theological register; extract "asymptotic + never complete" as a standalone design principle |
