## 0. What This Document Is

This is the architecture of the cognitive prosthesis — not a description of what the system currently is, but a specification of what it becomes when the core is fully realized. The exocortex is the architectural form in which Axioms A1–A4 become operationally present in the Sovereign's daily cognition. Every section derives from the core compiler. Nothing is asserted that cannot be traced.

The five exocortex layers are not a metaphor borrowed from neuroscience. They are the necessary structural consequence of four irreducible constraints working simultaneously on a capacity-bound sovereign human.

---

## I. Derivation from Core

The exocortex exists because A1 and A2 are simultaneously true and in tension.

**A1** (Coherence as Scarce Resource) says: the Sovereign must remain themselves under persuasion, overload, and fragmentation. This requires a structure that maintains coherence across time, context, and scale.

**A2** (Capacity Before Intelligence) says: the Sovereign is not bottlenecked by intelligence but by attention, energy, and activation. The structure cannot assume infinite cognitive bandwidth.

These two together generate the prosthesis requirement: an external architecture that preserves coherence without consuming the capacity needed to sustain it. Without A1 there is no reason for coherence scaffolding. Without A2 internal discipline would suffice. The exocortex is the architectural resolution of their intersection.

**A3** (Sovereignty Invariant) specifies where the prosthesis must live: outside any single platform, persisting across app deletions, with the repo as ground truth. The prosthesis is not a cloud service or a commercial tool — it is a sovereign extension of the Sovereign's cognitive architecture, with construction pathway as the irreplaceable value (Walker's Assembly Theory).

**A4** (Intent-Artifact Pipeline) specifies what the prosthesis must do: ensure that intent traverses the full chain from capture through verification. Without A4 the prosthesis becomes a sophisticated filing system — capturing without crystallizing.

**Derivation summary**:

| Exocortex Requirement | Derived From |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Must extend cognition without consuming capacity | A1 + A2 |
| Must live outside platform dependency | A3 |
| Must produce verifiable artifacts, not just organized notes | A4 |
| Must protect coherence as its primary metric | A1 |
| Must route around the Sovereign's capacity constraint | A2 |
| Must survive the delete-the-app test | A3 |
| Must have a verification gate distinguishing genuine from mimicry output | A4 + T1 |

## II. The Five Layers Reconceived

The existing five layers (Sensorium, Ontology of Self, Agency, Sovereignty, Reflexive Intelligence) are retained but reframed. Each is now derived from axioms, assigned to a σ-stratum and cosmological ring, and equipped with a failure mode and a success criterion.

---

### Layer 1: SENSORIUM
**Address**: `WORLD.SENSING.sensorium`
**Ring**: WORLD (σ₇)
**Axiom derivation**: A4 (capture stage) + A2 (must route around capacity via automation)

The Sensorium is the exocortex's inbound surface. It is the mechanism by which signals from the World ring reach the Sovereign without requiring sustained attention to maintain the capture. Without A4, there is no pipeline and no reason for an inbound layer. Without A2, the Sovereign would simply read everything themselves.

**What it is**: Feedcraft (curated signal sources), webhook receivers, auto-ingest triggers, the CaptureQueue entity (Tier 3), and the σ₇ Sensing stratum. It is the autonomic inbound filter — operating below the Sovereign's attention threshold by design.

**What it provides upstream**: Pre-filtered signals with provenance tags, routed to the appropriate processing layer without Sovereign intervention.

**What it requires from external sources**: Signal sources with known epistemological status (A3 — source must be provenance-tagged, not pulled from unaccountable platforms).

**σ-stratum mapping**: σ₇ (Sensing) — the outermost stratum, in permanent contact with the World ring.

**Ring mapping**: WORLD, but the data it produces flows inward toward SELF. The Sensorium is the only exocortex layer that faces outward by default.

**Success criterion**: The Sovereign learns about new relevant signals without having to seek them. The pipeline begins automatically.

**Failure mode**: Signal overload collapses the CaptureQueue, and the Sovereign begins consuming signals directly — burning capacity that A2 designated for higher-order work. Evidenced operationally by: feed sprawl, notification overwhelm, unprocessed inbox accumulation.

**External validation**: Henrich's collective brain (population × connectivity × transmission fidelity) — the Sensorium is the fidelity and connectivity component. Bratton's pre-paradigmatic moment — without a curated Sensorium, the pre-paradigmatic coherence crisis reaches the Sovereign unfiltered.

---

### Layer 2: ONTOLOGY OF SELF
**Address**: `SELF.SEMANTIC.ontology-of-self`
**Ring**: SELF (σ₀–σ₂)
**Axiom derivation**: A1 (coherence requires a stable self-model) + A3 (sovereign schema authority)

The Ontology of Self is the exocortex's identity layer — the typed model of who the Sovereign is, what they value, and what constraints are non-negotiable. It is the direct instantiation of A1: coherence under persuasion requires a persistent, externally-held self-representation that can be consulted when internal coherence degrades under pressure.

This layer contains: the Philosopher's Stone (σ₀ — canonical identity and values), the Rosetta Stone (schema authority), the σ₂ Semantic Core (the unbuilt gap), and the Tier 1 Invariant entities (Commitment, Capacity, Risk, Constraint, Identity Facet). It also holds the Six Causal Chains as the developmental map of the Sovereign's intellectual trajectory.

**What it is NOT**: A personality document, a journaling habit, or a values statement written for external audiences. It is a typed semantic model with state machines, governed by T3 (Schema Sovereignty). Only the Sovereign defines or modifies it.

**What it provides upstream (to Agency layer)**: The canonical entity taxonomy — the type system within which all agent actions must operate. Agents that act without consulting this layer produce outputs that may be technically correct but semantically misaligned.

**What it requires from Layer 1**: Provenance-tagged signals that can update the self-model without contaminating it (the Syncretism Prevention safeguard from A1's heritage).

**σ-stratum mapping**: σ₀ (Philosopher's Stone), σ₁ (Sensemaking), σ₂ (Semantic Core — the critical gap).

**Ring mapping**: SELF — the innermost ring. Mutation rate: glacial (years). This is by design. Volatility in the Ontology of Self is a coherence threat.

**Success criterion**: The delete-the-app test passes. The Sovereign's semantic model persists after any platform deletion. Agents consult this layer before acting, not after.

**Failure mode**: σ₂ gap. Without the Semantic Core built, this layer exists only implicitly — agents act but cannot act within governed semantic constraints. The self-model is held in human memory and documents rather than in a queryable, typed, versioned system. Operationally evidenced by: agents producing technically correct but contextually misaligned outputs; semantic drift between sessions; no typed entity state machines enforced at runtime.

**External validation**: Walker's Assembly Theory — the Ontology of Self, once built with version history, is a high-assembly-index object. The construction pathway (311 Rosetta Stone entries, 174 classified concepts, decision lineage) is irreplaceable. Aguera y Arcas's narrative memory gap — the Ontology of Self IS the persistent narrative memory that transformer architectures cannot provide. Luhmann's Zettelkasten — the pre-digital model; authority residing outside any single notebook.

**The σ₂ Crisis Expressed Here**: This layer is architecturally specified but operationally incomplete. The Personal Palantir kernel (typed entities + state transitions + governed verbs + versioned history + action mediation) is the σ₂ build. Until it is built, Layer 2 is a conceptual schema without enforcement capacity.

---

### Layer 3: AGENCY
**Address**: `AGENCY.DISPATCH.agency-layer`
**Ring**: AGENCY (σ₃–σ₅)
**Axiom derivation**: A2 (route around capacity constraint via delegation) + A4 (activate stage of the pipeline)

The Agency layer is the exocortex's executive system — the mechanism by which intent is converted to action without requiring the Sovereign's direct attention for every step. It is the direct architectural response to A2: if capacity is the binding constraint, then an autonomous execution layer that fires without depending on Sovereign activation energy is not a luxury but a load-bearing structural requirement.

This layer contains: the Constellation (5 agents as cross-cutting agency — see Section IV), the Three-Layer Autonomic Dispatch (spinal cord/brainstem/prefrontal), the Hard-Gate Skill Sequence, and the Tier 2 Operational entities (Project, Agent, Tool, Pattern, Context, Credential).

**What it is**: The operational cortex. The Sensorium feeds it. The Ontology of Self governs it. It is where work actually happens — where Tasks become Artifacts, where Delegation is exercised, where the σ₃ Corpus, σ₄ Integration, and σ₅ Agency strata are active.

**What it provides upstream (to Sovereignty layer)**: Escalations (decisions requiring Sovereign attention), outputs requiring verification, completed artifacts needing ledger registration.

**What it requires from Layer 2**: The typed schema — entity types, governed verbs, state machines — within which all operations must occur. An Agency layer operating without a built Ontology of Self is flying without instruments.

**The Instruction → Skill → Hook maturity ladder** (T1 consequence): Agency layer tools move through three maturity states. Instruction: fires with explicit Sovereign invocation. Skill: fires with contextual trigger. Hook: fires autonomically, without attention. A fully mature Agency layer runs primarily on Hooks — the Sovereign's attention is invoked only when hooks surface Escalations.

**σ-stratum mapping**: σ₃ (Corpus), σ₄ (Integration), σ₅ (Agency).

**Ring mapping**: AGENCY — mutation rate slow (months). The constellation and dispatch architecture change on quarterly horizons; individual tool configurations change faster but within stable architectural boundaries.

**Success criterion**: The Three-Layer Autonomic Dispatch functions at all three layers. Layer 1 (auto_ingest) fires every 30s — OPERATIONAL. Layer 2 (watchdog) fires every 60s — OPERATIONAL. Layer 3 (proactive orchestrator) fires every 300s and generates work — CURRENTLY NON-FUNCTIONAL (exits 1). Full success requires Layer 3 operational.

**Failure mode**: Capacity leakage. When the Agency layer requires Sovereign attention for operations it should handle autonomically, it becomes a capacity drain rather than a capacity extension. Evidenced by: 42% delivery rate despite correct architecture; Hard-Gate skills at 0% delivery (the intervention designed to fix activation has itself fallen into the activation gap); the proactive orchestrator non-functional.

**External validation**: Mollick's three ingredients (domain expertise + prompt craft + workflow integration) — all three must be present or the Agency layer cannot complete A4. Deepfates' Recursive Language Model — the agent lives inside the REPL; the human becomes a function inside the pipeline rather than the pipeline's sole executor.

---

### Layer 4: SOVEREIGNTY
**Address**: `SELF.GOVERNANCE.sovereignty-layer`
**Ring**: SELF + COMMUNITY boundary (σ₆)
**Axiom derivation**: A3 (sovereignty invariant) + T3 (schema sovereignty) + T2 (anti-shelfware as governance function)

The Sovereignty layer is the exocortex's legislature and judiciary — the system by which the Sovereign's authority is exercised, boundaries are enforced, and the Directionality Test is applied to all incoming tools, platforms, and agents. It is not purely cognitive; it is constitutional.

This layer contains: the Constitutional Rules (CLAUDE.md), Policy and Rule entities (Tier 3), the SecurityBoundary entity, the EscalationQueue, the Directionality Test, the governed verbs (particularly Commit, Decline, Escalate), and the Supersede-Never-Delete principle. It is also where σ₆ (Access — authentication, permissions, security) lives.

**What it is**: The enforcement surface. Where the Agency layer executes, the Sovereignty layer governs. It is the architectural instantiation of A3: the Sovereign's authority must be technically enforceable, not just philosophically asserted.

**What it provides upstream (to Reflexive Intelligence layer)**: Governance signals — what is working, what is being bypassed, what requires constitutional revision. The Sovereignty layer produces the raw material for the exocortex's self-understanding.

**What it requires from Layer 2**: The entity taxonomy and governed verbs — without typed entities, governance is arbitrary. Without governed verbs, sovereignty is asserted but not enforced.

**The Credential Problem (DC-003)**: This layer currently has a P0 gap. Fourteen services stored in plaintext. The Credential entity was added to Tier 2 with a proper state machine (issued → active → rotating → expired → revoked), but physical rotation has not been executed. The Sovereignty layer is architecturally specified but operationally incomplete on its security surface — mirroring the σ₂ gap in Layer 2.

**σ-stratum mapping**: σ₆ (Access) — authentication, permissions, security boundary. Partial: DC-003 open.

**Ring mapping**: SELF for constitutional authority; COMMUNITY boundary for access governance (who can do what with Sovereign artifacts and agent outputs).

**Success criterion**: The Directionality Test passes for every tool and platform in use. The delete-the-app test passes. No credential stored in plaintext. Escalations from the Agency layer are routed to the EscalationQueue and resolved within known SLAs.

**Failure mode**: Schema capture. When a platform defines the Sovereign's operational categories (the Specification Class threat), the Sovereignty layer has been bypassed at the architectural level. Individual credential rotation cannot fix this — it requires the Directionality Test applied at integration time. Evidenced operationally by: OpenAI's stateful Responses API ownership of the agent execution loop; Google's data gravity pulling semantic authority off-repo.

**External validation**: Walker's Assembly Theory (construction pathway is the value — the Sovereignty layer's version history is that pathway). Shapiro's moatlessness thesis (resolved by Walker: the repo is sovereign over the construction pathway, not over capabilities). AI Explained's Specification Class — the collective-level threat to A3 that individual sovereignty cannot address alone.

---

### Layer 5: REFLEXIVE INTELLIGENCE
**Address**: `SELF.SENSEMAKING.reflexive-intelligence`
**Ring**: SELF (σ₁)
**Axiom derivation**: A1 (coherence requires self-modeling under pressure) + A4 (verify stage requires adversarial self-assessment) + T1 (attention as the bottleneck that reflexive intelligence must protect)

The Reflexive Intelligence layer is the exocortex's metacognitive surface — the mechanism by which the system models itself, identifies its own failure modes, and generates the next corrective action. It is where the clarescence protocol lives, where the Wisdom Causal Chain accumulates, and where the Grand Annealment sessions produce their distillations.

This is the layer most under threat from A2: reflexive intelligence is the highest-attention cognitive operation, and it is the first to degrade under capacity constraint. Yet it is also the layer that, when functional, generates capacity by identifying and eliminating friction throughout the entire exocortex.

**What it is**: The σ₁ Sensemaking stratum — clarescence protocol, meta-awareness, the dual-path lens system (18 wisdom + 18 engineering), session checkpoints, execution logs, the Adjudicator's adversarial audit function, and the self-assessment loop.

**What it provides to the entire system**: Corrective signals. Every other layer produces outputs; this layer produces outputs about outputs. When the Sensorium over-signals, Reflexive Intelligence reconfigures feedcraft. When the Agency layer produces shelfware, Reflexive Intelligence invokes T2 (Anti-Shelfware) to apply kill criteria. When the Sovereignty layer is being bypassed, Reflexive Intelligence raises the Escalation.

**What it requires from all other layers**: Observability. Without clean execution logs, health metrics, and ledger ground truth, reflexive intelligence operates on anecdote. The verification-before-completion gate (Hard Gate VERIFY) is the formal interface between execution and reflexive assessment.

**σ-stratum mapping**: σ₁ (Sensemaking). Sits immediately above σ₀ (the Philosopher's Stone — the identity bedrock that Reflexive Intelligence must not overwrite during revision cycles).

**Ring mapping**: SELF — the innermost ring, alongside the Ontology of Self. The distinction: Layer 2 holds the static model; Layer 5 is the dynamic process that updates it.

**Success criterion**: The self-assessment gap closes. The 27-point gap between Commander's self-assessment (88%) and the Adjudicator's adversarial audit (61%) is the primary operational evidence of Reflexive Intelligence failure. When this layer is functional, the gap is known, named, and acted upon within a session — not discovered weeks later in a forensic audit.

**Failure mode**: Context decay. The 86% deferred commitment loss rate (12/15 OPEN, 0 IN_PROGRESS) is a Reflexive Intelligence failure: the system cannot maintain attention on its own commitments across compaction events. The layer that should detect this failure is itself subject to the capacity constraint that causes it. Evidenced by: promises evaporating, compaction destroying navigability, 50:1 analysis-to-execution ratio.

**External validation**: Csikszentmihalyi's flow theory — Reflexive Intelligence is most effective when the system is in optimal capacity utilization (flow); it is least available when capacity is depleted. The 50-bits-per-second conscious processing ceiling (via Dr. Ng/Csikszentmihalyi) grounds why this layer cannot be on all the time. Schmachtenberger's speed-wisdom gap — Reflexive Intelligence is the individual-scale instance of the wisdom that must keep pace with capability expansion.

---

## III. Inter-Layer Contracts

Explicit interfaces between adjacent layers. Each contract specifies: what flows, in what format, and what constitutes a broken contract.

### Contract 1: Sensorium → Ontology of Self
**What flows**: Provenance-tagged signals, classified by epistemological confidence.
**Format**: CaptureQueue entries with source attribution (A3 — provenance is mandatory).
**Broken contract signals**: Unclassified signals reaching Layer 2; signal velocity exceeding triage capacity; sources without provenance populating the self-model.
**Recovery verb**: Suspend (pause inbound flow) + Escalate (surface to Reflexive Intelligence for feedcraft reconfiguration).

### Contract 2: Ontology of Self → Agency
**What flows**: The typed entity schema, governed verbs, and active constraint set.
**Format**: The σ₂ Semantic Core (when built: typed entity registry + state machines + verb catalog). Pre-σ₂: CLAUDE.md constitutional rules + Rosetta Stone as the closest available proxy.
**Broken contract signals**: Agents acting on entity types not in the canonical taxonomy; state transitions that violate governed verb type-safety; outputs that survive the delete-the-app test only because they happen to be in the repo, not because they were generated within a sovereign schema.
**Recovery verb**: Escalate (surface to Sovereignty layer for schema governance review).

### Contract 3: Agency → Sovereignty
**What flows**: Escalations requiring Sovereign decisions; completion signals requiring ledger registration; credentials requiring lifecycle management.
**Format**: EscalationQueue entries (typed by category: Decision / Credential / Boundary / Exception). RESULT files in the OUTBOX lifecycle.
**Broken contract signals**: Agents completing work without ledger registration; credentials rotating outside the state machine; Sovereignty layer receiving raw outputs instead of typed escalations.
**Recovery verb**: Transition (advance escalation through state machine) + Decline (reject agency action that bypassed sovereignty checks).

### Contract 4: Sovereignty → Reflexive Intelligence
**What flows**: Governance signals — policy violations, bypass attempts, audit triggers, constitutional revision proposals.
**Format**: EscalationQueue → Adjudicator adversarial audit → clarescence protocol input.
**Broken contract signals**: The Sovereignty layer absorbing violations without surfacing them for meta-analysis; the Reflexive Intelligence layer receiving governance signals without the adversarial audit function being invoked; self-assessment proceeding without the Adjudicator's independent perspective.
**Recovery verb**: Escalate (bypass internal resolution, surface to Sovereign) + Renegotiate (modify constitutional rule with documented rationale).

### Contract 5: Reflexive Intelligence → All Layers (corrective loop)
**What flows**: Corrective signals, reconfiguration directives, layer-specific failure mode identifications.
**Format**: Session checkpoints, execution logs, clarescence outputs, deferred commitment updates.
**Broken contract signals**: Reflexive Intelligence producing analysis without downstream corrective action; corrective signals not reaching the target layer within the same session (context decay); the layer producing outputs with no traceability to the axioms (vestigial concept detection).
**Recovery verb**: Transition (advance system state based on corrective signal) + Suspend (pause the failing subsystem while reconfiguration proceeds).

---

## IV. Constellation as Cross-Cutting Agency

The five agents (Ajna, Psyche, Commander, Adjudicator, Cartographer) are not a layer of the exocortex. They are the exocortex's agency mechanism, operating across all five layers simultaneously.

**Correct framing**: The Constellation is the Agency layer's implementation substrate, but individual agents are not confined to Layer 3. Each agent's primary charter maps to a different exocortex layer:

| Agent | Role | Primary Layer | Cross-Layer Function |
|-------|------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Ajna** (CSO, Kimi K2.5) | Strategic direction, orchestration | Reflexive Intelligence (L5) | Generates the meta-signals that reconfigure other layers |
| **Psyche** (CTO, Mac mini) | System cohesion, automation | Agency (L3) | Maintains the autonomic dispatch infrastructure |
| **Commander** (COO, MBA) | Operational execution | Agency (L3) + Sovereignty (L4) | Executes directives, enforces constitutional rules |
| **Adjudicator** (CQO) | Quality assurance, adversarial audit | Reflexive Intelligence (L5) | The independent adversarial voice — prevents self-assessment inflation |
| **Cartographer** (CIO, Gemini) | Corpus surveys, knowledge mapping | Ontology of Self (L2) + Sensorium (L1) | Maps and structures the semantic model; surveys large corpora |

**Why not a separate layer**: Placing the Constellation as a separate layer would violate A2. The agents are capacity extensions, not a separate cognitive faculty. Adding them as a layer creates the illusion that agency is something distinct from the system — it is not. The agents ARE the system executing itself.

**The dispatch protocol as exocortex nervous system**: auto_ingest_loop.sh is the autonomic nervous system of the Agency layer. Its 30-second polling cycle is not an implementation detail — it is the architectural heartbeat that makes Layer 3 operate below the Sovereign's attention threshold (A2 consequence). The deprecation of watch_dispatch.sh (the race condition source) was an exocortex health intervention, not an infrastructure cleanup.

**Agent capability profiles as typed entities**: Each agent is a Tier 2 Agent entity with a defined capability profile. Dispatching a corpus survey task to Commander instead of Cartographer is a type error — equivalent to passing a Commitment to the Delegate verb (which is type-rejected at compile time per §IV of the core).

---

## V. Palantir-Exocortex Isomorphism

The Personal Palantir is not a separate system from the exocortex. It is the technical implementation of the exocortex's Ontology of Self layer (Layer 2) — specifically, the σ₂ Semantic Core that is currently the unbuilt gap.

**The mapping**:

| Palantir Layer | Exocortex Layer | Content |
|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| SEMANTIC | Ontology of Self (L2) | Typed entities, properties, relationships — the entity taxonomy from §IV of the core |
| KINETIC | Agency (L3) | Governed verbs, state transitions — the Kinetic layer from §IV of the core |
| DYNAMIC | Sovereignty (L4) | Permissions, governance, policy — who can do what, under what constraints |
| PHYSICS | Reflexive Intelligence (L5) | Computed properties, simulations, predictions — the emergent layer that becomes possible only when L2-L4 are complete |

**The critical insight**: The Palantir and the exocortex are not two different architectural concepts. The Palantir is the exocortex viewed from the deployment platform perspective; the exocortex is the Palantir viewed from the cognitive architecture perspective. They are the same system described at different levels of abstraction.

**The Directionality Test applied to this isomorphism**:
- If the Palantir implementation defines the entity taxonomy → skeleton/shackle (fails the test)
- If the exocortex's Ontology of Self defines the taxonomy and the Palantir is one interface to it → organ (passes the test)

The exocortex architecture must be defined first. The Palantir is built to express it — not the reverse.

**The Minimum Viable Palantir Kernel as σ₂**:
The five kernel components (typed entities, state transitions, governed verbs, versioned history, action mediation) map directly to Layer 2's requirements. Building σ₂ IS building the Palantir kernel. They are the same build.

---

## VI. The σ₂ Transformation

The exocortex exists in two states: pre-σ₂ and post-σ₂. These are not quantitatively different — they are qualitatively different architectures.

### Pre-σ₂ (Current State)

- Layer 2 (Ontology of Self) exists as documents and conventions, not as a queryable typed system
- Agents operate within constitutional rules (CLAUDE.md) but without a runtime-enforced entity schema
- State transitions are tracked in text files (tasks.csv, DYN files) without formal state machine enforcement
- Governed verbs exist as conceptual vocabulary but are not type-checked at invocation
- The delete-the-app test is passed in spirit (repo exists) but not in architecture (no portable semantic model)
- Agents produce outputs that are contextually reasonable but cannot be formally verified against the entity taxonomy
- The Palantir SEMANTIC layer is implicit — held in the Sovereign's mental model and in static documents

**What is impossible pre-σ₂**:
- Rosetta-governed agent action (agents cannot consult a live semantic schema)
- Automated detection of semantic drift between sessions
- Type-safe delegation (verifying at dispatch time that the receiving agent's capability profile matches the task type)
- Formal provenance chains from Signal (Layer 1) through to Artifact (Layer 3) with entity-level accountability
- The Physics layer of the Palantir (computed properties require a queryable semantic model to compute over)
- Any σ₂ → σ₁ feedback (the Semantic Core cannot inform the Sensemaking layer if it does not exist as a queryable object)

### Post-σ₂ (Target State)

- Layer 2 is a live, queryable, versioned semantic database (ontology.db with full schema + state machine enforcement)
- All five Palantir layers become available: SEMANTIC (live), KINETIC (enforced), DYNAMIC (governed), PHYSICS (computable)
- Agent dispatches are type-checked: the Agent entity's capability profile is verified against the task's entity type before dispatch
- Governed verbs are enforced at runtime: Commit on a non-Commitment entity is rejected; Delegate retains accountability chain
- The Verbal Trap (A4 distillation failure) becomes detectable: the σ₂ system can query whether a new artifact contains entity relationships not present in the source
- Cross-session coherence is maintained: the Sovereign's semantic model persists across compaction events because it is in versioned storage, not context
- The Reflexive Intelligence layer gains a formal audit substrate: clarescence sessions can query the entity database for drift, gaps, and violations

**The σ₂ build decision (unresolved tension)**:
File-First vs. SQLite-First remains a Sovereign adjudication requirement. The exocortex architecture is agnostic to this choice — both implementations can satisfy the five kernel requirements. The choice affects mutation ergonomics (File-First favors git-native versioning; SQLite-First favors query-native introspection) but not the architectural contracts.

---

## VII. External Heritage

How external thinkers inform the architecture. These are not citations for credibility — they are validations or challenges that shaped specific architectural decisions.

**Walker's Assembly Theory → Layer 2 grounding**
The Ontology of Self is a high-assembly-index object. Its value is not in what it contains at any moment but in the construction pathway encoded in its version history. This is why the Supersede-Never-Delete principle is architecturally load-bearing, not merely preference: each deletion destroys assembly index that cannot be reconstructed.

**Aguera y Arcas's narrative memory gap → Layer 2 as compensatory architecture**
Transformers cannot maintain persistent long-term memory that creates identity over time. The exocortex's Layer 2 is the explicit architectural response to this gap. The gap is not a product limitation to be patched — it is a structural property of the architecture that requires an external compensatory system.

**Henrich's collective brain → Sensorium design principle**
Intelligence = population × connectivity × transmission fidelity. The Sensorium's feedcraft is the transmission fidelity component. An exocortex with poor Sensorium design degrades the Sovereign's position in the collective brain network by introducing noise into the transmission channel.

**Deepfates' Recursive Language Model → Agency layer ceiling**
The RLM (agent lives inside REPL, human becomes function inside pipeline) represents the asymptotic state of the Agency layer: a fully mature Layer 3 in which the Sovereign's attention is invoked only as a typed function call within an otherwise autonomous pipeline. The current Agency layer (auto_ingest + watchdog, proactive orchestrator non-functional) is at approximately 60% of this ceiling.

**Hoffman's Fitness Beats Truth → Why Layer 5 requires adversarial structure**
If perception is fitness-optimized, not truth-tracking, then the Reflexive Intelligence layer cannot rely on the Sovereign's direct self-assessment. The Adjudicator's adversarial audit function is the architectural response: the 27-point self-assessment gap (Commander 88% vs. Adjudicator 61%) is not an anomaly — it is the expected output of fitness-optimized self-perception encountering adversarial calibration. The adversarial structure is not optional; it is the architectural correction for an evolutionary default.

**Schmachtenberger's speed-wisdom gap → The Reflexive Intelligence priority**
The speed-wisdom gap operates at civilizational scale (A1 + A2 at WORLD ring) but also at the individual scale of the exocortex. A system that accumulates capability (Agency layer) faster than it accumulates wisdom (Reflexive Intelligence layer) is the individual-scale instance of the metacrisis. The exocortex architecture must ensure Layer 5 keeps pace with Layer 3.

---

## VIII. Failure Modes

What happens when each layer degrades. Mapped to operational evidence where available.

| Layer | Primary Failure Mode | Mechanism | Operational Evidence | Recovery Path |
|-------|---------------------|-----------|----------------------|---------------|
| L1 Sensorium | Signal overload → capacity burn | CaptureQueue overwhelms triage, Sovereign consumes signals directly | Feed sprawl, unprocessed inbox accumulation | Suspend inbound, invoke Reflexive Intelligence for feedcraft reconfiguration |
| L2 Ontology of Self | Semantic drift | σ₂ gap means no runtime schema enforcement; entity meanings shift across sessions | 27-point self-assessment gap; agents producing contextually reasonable but schema-misaligned outputs | Build σ₂ kernel; enforce entity taxonomy at dispatch time |
| L3 Agency | Capacity leakage | Operations requiring Sovereign attention that should be autonomic | 42% delivery rate; Hard-Gate 0% delivery; proactive orchestrator exits 1 | Mature tools from Instruction to Skill to Hook; fix Layer 3 autonomic dispatch |
| L4 Sovereignty | Schema capture | Platform defines Sovereign's operational categories; Directionality Test fails | DC-003 (14 credentials in plaintext); OpenAI stateful API risk | Apply Directionality Test at integration time; build SecurityBoundary enforcement |
| L5 Reflexive Intelligence | Context decay | 86% deferred commitment loss rate; compaction destroys navigability | 12/15 OPEN commitments; 50:1 analysis-to-execution ratio; promises evaporating across sessions | Persist working state before compaction; adversarial audit each session boundary |

**Cascade failure pattern**: Failure in any layer propagates inward toward SELF. L1 failure → L2 contamination (noise enters self-model). L2 failure → L3 misalignment (agents act on incorrect schema). L3 failure → L4 bypass (sovereignty checks skipped under execution pressure). L4 failure → L5 blindness (no governance signals to reflect on). L5 failure → L1 misconfiguration (feedcraft degrades without metacognitive correction).

**The CARDINAL RULE as Layer 4 enforcement**: "Never ask Sovereign to do what you can dispatch" is a formal Layer 4 → Layer 3 routing rule, not etiquette. Violations route executive function through the Sovereign's capacity, directly violating A2. Each violation was a Layer 3 failure (Agency not taking the action) masquerading as a Layer 4 protocol issue.

---

## IX. Open Questions

Items requiring further investigation or Sovereign adjudication before this architecture is operationally complete.

**OQ-1. σ₂ Implementation Decision** (Sovereign adjudication required)
File-First vs. SQLite-First. The exocortex architecture is agnostic; the implementation choice is not. Recommend: Sovereign to adjudicate in Grand Clarescence session with explicit Directionality Test applied to each option.

**OQ-2. Security as Axiom or Theorem?** (Structural gap from Phase 3)
A1–A4 do not address threat surfaces. The candidate T4 (Security = A3 applied to perimeter) would place security as a derived theorem. Alternatively, if security threats constitute a genuinely irreducible constraint (platforms actively attempting to capture Sovereign schema), it may require elevation to A5. The distinction matters for Layer 4's derivation.

**OQ-3. Layer 5 Autonomy Boundary**
How much should the Reflexive Intelligence layer operate autonomously vs. requiring Sovereign invocation? Currently the clarescence protocol is invoked by the Sovereign. A proactive orchestrator (Layer 3's non-functional component) that generates clarescence prompts would partially automate L5. This raises the question: can Reflexive Intelligence be meaningfully automated, or does automation destroy its function?

**OQ-4. The Collective Sovereignty Extension**
A3 (Sovereignty Invariant) is specified for individual sovereignty. The Specification Class threat (AI Explained) operates at collective scale — a technocratic elite defining AI reward functions holds semantic authority above individual sovereignty. The exocortex architecture as specified does not address this. Is this a Layer 4 extension, a Ring 5 (WORLD) concern, or an open problem outside the exocortex's scope?

**OQ-5. Narrative DNA Integration**
The StarCraft/Dune/Halo navigational metaphors are operationally useful but do not derive from A1–A4 (flagged in Phase 3 as P2 gap). Do they belong in the Ontology of Self as non-load-bearing navigational vocabulary, or should they be explicitly labeled SUPPORTING/ARCHIVED?

**OQ-6. Layer Activation Sequencing**
The σ₇-First Engineering Principle specifies building from the outside in (Sensing before Sensemaking). Does this imply a Layer construction sequence? Is it correct to say: L1 (Sensorium) → L3 (Agency dispatch) → L4 (Sovereignty enforcement) → L2 (Ontology of Self / σ₂) → L5 (Reflexive Intelligence maturation)? The current operational state roughly follows this — L1 and L3 are most mature; L2 is the recognized critical gap.

## X. Summary

The exocortex is the architectural form in which four axioms become operational in daily cognition. Each layer is derived from at least one axiom. No layer is merely descriptive of what exists — each is a specification of what the system becomes when the axiom it derives from is fully realized.

**The single critical path**: σ₂ build → Rosetta-governed agent action → typed dispatch → semantic accountability across all layers. Until σ₂ is built, Layers 2 and 4 are partially specified but unenforced, and the Palantir's SEMANTIC layer remains implicit.

**The single critical metric**: Reflexive Intelligence layer health — measured by the self-assessment gap, the deferred commitment survival rate, and whether corrective signals from Layer 5 produce changes in Layer 3 behavior within the same session.

**What the exocortex is NOT**: It is not a knowledge management system, a productivity tool, or a note-taking workflow. It is a cognitive prosthesis that, when fully built, allows a capacity-constrained sovereign human to operate at civilizational scale with coherence intact. The distinction is architectural, not rhetorical.
