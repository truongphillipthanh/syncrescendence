# CLARESCENCE: BLITZKRIEG — MBA Execution Debt Clearance + Constellation Synergy

**Date**: 2026-02-12
**Agent**: Commander (MacBook Air)
**Fidelity**: Operational (0 + 1-7)
**Passes Run**: 0 + 1-7

---

## Phase 0: Orient & Situate

- **Fingerprint**: c332459 (start of session)
- **Branch**: main
- **Working tree**: 6 modified DYN-* files (hook artifacts) — committed in Phase 0
- **Inbox**: 20 CONFIRM/RESULT/EXECLOG files from 9 completed tasks (6 Adjudicator, 2 Psyche, 1 Psyche dispatch)
- **Fleet**: Commander (MBA+mini), Psyche (mini, active), Adjudicator (mini, degraded), Ajna (MBA, 234 skills), Cartographer (HIBERNATED)
- **Tier**: T1a (repo-operational)

---

## Pass 1: Triumvirate Calibration

- **Destination**: INT-1612 (P0, begin ALL automations), INT-1504 (cascade deployment), INT-P015 (dual-machine paradigm), INT-1202 (heavy machinery velocity)
- **Current state**: MBA Commander operational with 17 skills installed. DA-12 stuck on infrastructure. 20 inbox items unprocessed. git-sync dormant.
- **Fit verdict**: CLOSES GAPS — clears execution debt, completes MBA kinetic setup, dispatches to reinforcements

## Pass 2: Lens Sweep — 17/18

All lenses PASS except Lens 14 (Canon alignment) which requires COCKPIT.md update — included in plan.

## Pass 3: CANON Coherence

- COCKPIT.md stale: Commander listed as Mac mini only → updated to dual-residency
- Hooks section stale: "NOT registered" → corrected to "registered on both machines"

## Pass 4: Omni-Qualities

- Omniscience: IMPROVED (dual-machine sensing)
- Omnipresence: IMPROVED (Commander dual-resident)
- Omnipotence: PARTIAL (MBA has network, no MCP yet)
- Omnibenevolence: ALIGNED

## Pass 5: Five Faces

- Sensing: IMPROVED | Meaning: STABLE | Intention: ALIGNED | Embodiment: PARTIAL | Harmony: IMPROVING

## Pass 6: Rosetta Precision

- "Execution debt" proposed for Rosetta entry
- "HF signal skills" = Psyche's temporal intelligence suite — new term

## Pass 7: Backlog Coherence

- Unblocks: SYN-35 (MBA setup → ~95%), INT-1612 (automation sprint)
- Creates: inbox_cleanup.sh automation, ACKNOWLEDGE ledger event type
- Net T1a↔T2: POSITIVE

## Convergent Path

5-lane BLITZKRIEG with 3 Commander subagents + 3 cross-agent dispatches:

1. **Subagent A**: Inbox cleanup — create inbox_cleanup.sh, add ACKNOWLEDGE to ledger, process 20 items
2. **Subagent B**: Fix git-sync launchd plist (KeepAlive + rebase-abort safety)
3. **Subagent C**: COCKPIT.md dual-residency + this clarescence record
4. **Dispatch → Psyche**: OpenClaw 6 must-adopt actions sprint
5. **Dispatch → Adjudicator**: codex-sonnet smoke test + SYN-53 Todoist attempt
6. **Dispatch → Ajna**: INT-1612 automation audit (classify ACTIVE/DORMANT/NEEDS-SOVEREIGN)

## Decision Atoms

- **DA-14**: Commander dual-residency in COCKPIT.md (INT-P015, INT-1504)
- **DA-15**: ACKNOWLEDGE event type in ledger protocol (INT-P003)

## Falsifier

If inbox cleanup takes >10 minutes or git-sync fix breaks other launchd services, the phased approach is undercosted.

## Confidence

High (88%) — Phases 1-2 are mechanical with verified state. Cross-agent results are async.

## Dependencies

- Builds on: DA-13 (reinit prompt), DA-12 (onboarding pivot), DA-01 (Cartographer hibernate)
- Feeds into: INT-1612 (automation sprint), SYN-35 (MBA completion)
