## SUCCESS CRITERIA VERIFICATION

- [x] ARCHIVE/ created with compressed distillation (prior session)
- [x] CANON-30400 exists with YAML frontmatter
- [x] CANON-30410-30450 created (5 asteroids)
- [x] QUEUE/PENDING_REVIEW/tech/ deleted
- [x] Commit meaningful with clear message
- [x] Execution report saved (this file)
- [ ] CURRENT_STATE.md updated (next)
- [ ] BACKLOG.md updated (next)

---

## NOTES

1. CANON-30500 (Platform Primitives) deferred to next cycle per directive
2. Pre-existing staged changes (Transcendence/ reorganization) included in commit
3. All CANON files follow postpositive naming convention
4. All CANON files have YAML frontmatter per schema
