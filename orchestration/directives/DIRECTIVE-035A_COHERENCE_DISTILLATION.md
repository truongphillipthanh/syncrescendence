# DIRECTIVE-035A: COHERENCE QUALIFIED DISTILLATION + INTEGRATION
## Stream A: The Correct Defrag — Absorption, Integration, Archival
**Issued**: 2026-01-02
**Authority**: Oracle9 under Principal direction
**Classification**: CRITICAL — Completing the Work Oracle4 Should Have Done
**Execution**: Claude Code
**Parallel Stream**: DIRECTIVE-035B handles Tech Lunar + Source Processing

---

## PRINCIPAL'S MANDATE

> "Incredible. Full recovery. And now we have the structures to actually determine if we've successfully complete our goals. Knowing what we know now, produce the directives to complete the absorption and integration and (if appropriate to our standards, archival.) Essentially we're running the correct Defragging process."

---

## WHAT THE CORRECT DEFRAG MEANS

Oracle4's error: **Applied metabolism uniformly without verification**. Claimed "2.8M → 85K (97% compression)" but:
- Never verified absorption completeness
- Deleted source before distillation confirmed
- Lost 99% of content through procedural failure

The CORRECT process:
1. **EXAMINE** — Read source content thoroughly
2. **COMPARE** — Cross-reference against existing CANON/GENESIS
3. **IDENTIFY** — What's absorbed vs unique
4. **DECIDE** — 18-lens evaluation per section
5. **VERIFY** — Confirm distillation completeness
6. **DELETE** — Only after verification
7. **DOCUMENT** — Decisions and rationale

## 18-LENS EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

For each content section, evaluate:

| # | Lens | Question | Weight |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Syncrescendent Route | Does this advance the continuous, cyclic, recursive flow? | HIGH |
| 2 | Bitter Lesson | Will this scale with compute? Or be obsoleted? | CRITICAL |
| 3 | Antifragile | Does preserving this make us stronger from disorder? | HIGH |
| 4 | Meet the Moment | Is this timely for current capability? | MEDIUM |
| 5 | Steelman/Redteam | Can this survive strongest criticism? | HIGH |
| 6 | Personal Idiosyncrasies | Does this honor Principal's cognitive style? | MEDIUM |
| 7 | Potency w/o Resolution Loss | Maximum compression with full fidelity? | CRITICAL |
| 8 | Elegance | Minimal surface, predictable patterns? | MEDIUM |
| 9 | Agentify + Human-Navigable | 2 decisions to any file? | HIGH |
| 10 | First Principles | Does this NEED to exist? | CRITICAL |
| 11 | Systems Thinking | Do parts relate coherently to whole? | HIGH |
| 12 | Industrial Engineering | Does this optimize throughput? | MEDIUM |
| 13 | Complexity Theory | Essential or accidental complexity? | HIGH |
| 14 | Permaculture | Self-sustaining or requiring maintenance? | MEDIUM |
| 15 | Design Thinking | Human-centered? | MEDIUM |
| 16 | Agile | Shippable increment? | MEDIUM |
| 17 | Lean | Waste eliminated? | HIGH |
| 18 | Six Sigma | Defects minimized? | MEDIUM |

**Threshold**: 12/18 HIGH/CRITICAL lenses must pass for CANON. 8/18 for ARCHIVE. Below 8 = RELEASE.

- CANON-20030: META_GOVERNOR — The orchestrating intelligence specification

**ARCHIVE Expansion**:
- ARCHIVE-COGNITIVE-PALACE-ARTIFACTS.md — The 60 artifact specifications compressed
- ARCHIVE-COGNITIVE-PALACE-MATRICES.md — The 7 cross-layer integration patterns

### 1.4 Execution

**Score**: 13-14/18 = **CANON** tier

### 2.3 Decision: CANON-35xxx Expansion

Create CANON-35xxx satellites in Wisdom chain:

**Note**: morphologism.md and fundamental-essentia.md may integrate into the above rather than separate satellites.

### 2.4 Execution

```bash
# Phase 2A: Cross-reference with GENESIS-001-LINEAGE
cat CANON/CANON-00002-*LINEAGE* 2>/dev/null || echo "Check GENESIS location"

# Phase 2B: Read each source file, identify what GENESIS absorbed vs unique
for file in Coherence/4-Roadmap/Coherence_Lunar_Metahumanism-*.md; do
  echo "=== EXAMINING: $file ==="
  wc -c "$file"

## PHASE 3: MENTAL MODELS (564K)

### 3.1 Current State Analysis

**Source**: `Coherence/3-Mental Models/` (5 files)
- Ontological Container
- Knowledge Taxonomy + Culmination
- Meaning Taxonomy + Culmination

**Related CANON**:
- CANON-31100 (Acumen/Information)
- CANON-34100 (Mastery/Knowledge)

### 3.2 18-Lens Evaluation

| Lens | Assessment | Score |
|------|------------|-------|
| 1-11 | Similar pattern to Metahumanism | 11/11 ✓ |
| 12-18 | More operational than philosophical | 5/7 ✓ |

**Score**: 12-13/18 = **CANON** tier (integrate into existing chains)

### 3.3 Decision: Integrate into Existing CANON

Rather than new satellites, INTEGRATE into:
- CANON-31100 (Acumen): Add Meaning Taxonomy section
- CANON-34100 (Mastery): Add Knowledge Taxonomy section
- Create CANON-00016-ONTOLOGICAL_FRAMEWORK as cosmos-level reference

### 3.4 Execution

```bash
# Phase 3A: Read source content
cat "Coherence/3-Mental Models/Coherence_Lunar_Ontological Container.md"
cat "Coherence/3-Mental Models/knowledge/"*
cat "Coherence/3-Mental Models/meaning/"*

# Phase 3B: Read target CANON documents
cat CANON/CANON-31100-*ACUMEN*
cat CANON/CANON-34100-*MASTERY*

# Phase 3C: Create integration patches or new CANON-00016
```

## PHASE 4: ARTIFACTS (684K)

### 4.1 Current State Analysis

**Source**: `Coherence/1-Artifacts/` (87 files)
- Human corpus (21 artifacts)
- Machine corpus (21 artifacts)
- Synthesis documents

**Current CANON**: CANON-00007 (Artifact Production Protocol)

### 4.2 18-Lens Evaluation

| Lens | Assessment | Score |
|------|------------|-------|
| 2. Bitter Lesson | **CRITICAL**: 21-artifact system may be obsoleted | ⚠️ |
| 3. Antifragile | Pattern language survives; implementations may not | ⚠️ |
| 10. First Principles | Pattern language YES; all implementations NO | PARTIAL |

**Score**: 7-8/18 = **ARCHIVE** tier (pattern reference, not CANON)

### 4.3 Decision: ARCHIVE as Pattern Language

Create: ARCHIVE-ARTIFACT-PATTERN-LANGUAGE.md
- Index of 21 artifacts
- Pattern descriptions (not full implementations)
- Machine/Human distinction preserved

### 4.4 Execution

```bash
# Phase 4A: Extract pattern index
ls -la "Coherence/1-Artifacts/"
ls -la "Coherence/1-Artifacts/- Artifact Corpus - Human/"
ls -la "Coherence/1-Artifacts/- Artifact Corpus - Machine/"

# Phase 4B: Create distilled ARCHIVE
```

## PHASE 5: META-NARRATIVE SCHEMAS (35K)

### 5.1 Current State

**Source**: `intelligence architecture/meta_narrative_and_perspectival_schemas.md`
**Related CANON**: CANON-00015-MACROSCOPIC_NARRATIVES (just created)

### 5.2 Decision: CANON-00016 or Integrate

**Option A**: Create CANON-00016-META_NARRATIVE_SCHEMAS as companion
**Option B**: Integrate into CANON-00015 as "Meta-Framework" section

**Recommended**: Option B — Integrate into CANON-00015

### 5.3 Execution

```bash
# Read source
cat "intelligence architecture/meta_narrative_and_perspectival_schemas.md"

# Update CANON-00015 with Meta-Framework section
```

**Source**: `Transcendence/` directory (from ACTUAL_TREE lines 2106-2153)
- Metaphysicalism (7 files)
- Monotheism (8 files)
- Nontheism (7 files)
- Profile/Autopsychography
- Way of Life/Code of Conduct (7 files)

**Related CANON**: CANON-35xxx (Wisdom chain)

### 6.2 18-Lens Evaluation

These represent the Principal's spiritual/philosophical research methodology. The 7-document pattern (taxonomy → dialectical → synthesis → culmination) is systematic.

**Score**: 10-11/18 = **CANON candidate** for selective integration

### 6.3 Decision: Selective CANON Integration + ARCHIVE

**CANON candidates** (inform CANON-35xxx):
- Metaphysicalism culmination
- Code of Conduct synthesis

**ARCHIVE**:
- Full research corpus as reference
- Autopsychography (founder context, restricted)
