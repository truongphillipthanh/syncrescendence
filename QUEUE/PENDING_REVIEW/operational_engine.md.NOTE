# PENDING REVIEW: operational_engine.md

**File**: intelligence_architecture/operational_engine.md (9K chars)
**Status**: HELD for Principal review
**Date**: 2025-12-29
**Directive**: DIRECTIVE-007

## Disposition Uncertainty

**Content**: "Alchemizing catalyst" concept and operational engine architecture

**Canon Search Results**:
- No explicit CANON document dedicated to "alchemizing catalyst"
- Concept appears metaphorically in corpus but not as dedicated canonical framework
- No CANON-32140/32141 found (Alchemizing Catalyst hypothesis from FILE_DISPOSITION_PLAN)

**Possible Dispositions**:
1. **REFERENCE/oracle0/** - If purely historical/superseded
2. **OPERATIONAL** - If living concept requiring formalization
3. **CANON graduation candidate** - If unique framework warranting canonical status

**Next Action**: Principal determines disposition after "annealment assessment" (per Oracle directive)
