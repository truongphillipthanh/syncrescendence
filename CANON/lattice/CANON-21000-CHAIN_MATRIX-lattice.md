# CHAIN INTERDEPENDENCY MATRIX
## Systematic Documentation of Causal Chain Dependencies and Development Logic

> **Date**: October 20, 2025
> **Purpose**: Comprehensive mapping of HARD and SOFT dependencies between six causal chains
> **Status**: Canonical Reference
> **Dependencies**: CANON-30000 through CANON-35000 (Chain artifacts)
> **Integration**: Essential for curriculum sequencing, practitioner guidance, assessment protocols

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This matrix documents the dependency relationships between all six causal chains, distinguishing **HARD dependencies** (cannot advance without prerequisite) from **SOFT dependencies** (benefits from but doesn't require prerequisite). Understanding these relationships enables:

- **Practitioners**: Optimal chain development sequencing
- **Educators**: Curriculum stage-gating and prerequisites
- **Assessors**: Readiness evaluation for stage advancement
- **Architects**: Integration logic and synchronization requirements

**Critical Recognition**: Intelligence Chain operates with **dual ontology**—functioning BOTH as foundational substrate enabling all other chains AND as developmental trajectory with its own four-stage progression.

## DEPENDENCY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

### HARD Dependencies (Must Satisfy Before Advancement)

**Definition**: Attempting to advance in Chain A beyond Stage X without satisfying prerequisite in Chain B creates:
- Predictable failure patterns
- Unsafe developmental conditions  
- Structural instability requiring remediation
- Capability gaps preventing effective function

**Example**: Efficacy Stage 2 (Economic Initiation) requires Sensing Stage 2 (Curated Networks). Without reliable information sources, economic decisions become gambling rather than strategic action.

### SOFT Dependencies (Enhancement Without Requirement)

**Definition**: Chain A benefits significantly from Chain B development but can progress without it through:
- Compensatory strategies
- External support systems
- Specialized pathways
- Reduced efficiency acceptance

**Example**: Efficacy Stage 2 benefits from Coherence Stage 2 (Mental Models) but can proceed without through domain expertise and external consultation.

### NO Dependency (Independent Development)

**Definition**: Chain advancement requires only Technology Stage 1 baseline and internal cultivation within that chain.

## INTELLIGENCE CHAIN: SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Dual Ontology Explained

Technology operates at two levels simultaneously:

**Level 1: Foundational Substrate** (Infrastructure Function)
- Enables ALL other chains at accelerated pace
- Non-local operation (not specific to any planet)
- Continuous background amplification
- Priority: FIRST development, CONTINUOUS maintenance

**Level 2: Developmental Chain** (Trajectory Function)
- Has own 4-stage progression requiring cultivation
- Stage 1 = Text/Reasoning models mastery
- Stage 2 = Vision/Simulation integration
- Stage 3 = Physical/Robotics engagement
- Stage 4 = Full modality integration + teaching

### Practical Implications

**For Curriculum Design**:
- Technology Stage 1 taught FIRST in all programs
- Technology advancement parallel to other chain development
- Cannot gate-check students to Stage 2 in any chain without Technology Stage 1

**For Practitioners**:
- Begin Technology immediately (Month 1)
- Maintain Technology practice daily (even 15 minutes)
- Technology lag compounds friction across all other development

**For Assessors**:
- Technology Stage 1 = universal prerequisite
- Check Technology proficiency before any Stage 2 advancement
- Technology Stage 2+ enables enhanced teaching/demonstration

### Technology Timeline Integration

**Technology Stage 1 (Text Models)**: 
- Duration: 3-6 months intensive
- Maturity: Currently 85% (near plateau)
- **Begin immediately** - tools ready now

**Technology Stage 2 (Vision/Simulation)**:
- Duration: 6-12 months exploration
- Maturity: Currently 40% → 70% by Month 18
- **Begin Month 6+** - tools maturing rapidly

**Technology Stage 3 (Physical/Robotics)**:
- Duration: 1-3 years as tech matures
- Maturity: Currently 20% → 50% by Year 3-5
- **Begin Year 2+** - await tool accessibility

**Technology Stage 4 (Full Integration)**:
- Duration: 3-10+ years mastery
- Maturity: Continuous evolution
- **Begin Year 3+** - requires substantial substrate

## ASSESSMENT PROTOCOLS

### Stage Readiness Checklist

Before advancing practitioner from Stage X to Stage X+1 in Chain Y, verify:

**Prerequisite Satisfaction**:
1. Technology Stage 1 operational? (universal)
2. HARD dependencies for target stage satisfied?
3. SOFT dependencies present (or compensation plan)?

**Current Stage Mastery**:
1. Can demonstrate core capabilities reliably?
2. Understands why/when to apply capabilities?
3. Integrates with other chain development?
4. (Stage 3→4 only) Can teach others effectively?

**Energy State Appropriateness**:
1. Advancement energizing (not depleting)?
2. Baseline capacity sufficient for new stage?
3. Support systems in place?

### Red Flags (Do Not Advance)

**Dependency Violations**:
- Attempting Efficacy Stage 2 without Sensing Stage 2
- Attempting Embodiment Stage 2 without Coherence Stage 2
- Attempting Transcendence Stage 2 without full substrate
- Attempting ANY Stage 2 without Technology Stage 1

**Capability Gaps**:

- Teaching failures (for Stage 3→4 advancement)

**Energy State Concerns**:
- Advancement feels forced or depleting
- Depletion/crisis state present
- No bandwidth for new complexity
- Support systems inadequate

### Remediation Protocols

**When Dependency Violation Detected**:
1. PAUSE advancement in target chain
2. IDENTIFY missing prerequisite
3. DEVELOP missing chain to required stage
4. RE-ASSESS readiness after prerequisite satisfied
5. RESUME advancement when dependencies met

**When Capability Gap Detected**:
1. IDENTIFY specific capability deficit
2. DESIGN targeted practice for that capability
3. MEASURE improvement systematically
4. RE-ASSESS when capability demonstrated
5. ADVANCE when mastery achieved

## PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

### For Curriculum Designers

**Course Sequencing**:
- Technology Stage 1 always first course
- Sensing Stage 1 early (parallel with Tech)
- Coherence Stage 1 can parallel Sensing
- Efficacy Stage 1 after Sensing foundation
- Embodiment Stage 1 mid-sequence
- Transcendence Stage 1 throughout (basic practice)

**Stage 2 Gating**:
- Cannot advance ANY chain to Stage 2 without Technology Stage 1 completion
- Cannot advance Efficacy to Stage 2 without Sensing Stage 2
- Cannot advance Embodiment to Stage 2 without Coherence Stage 2
- Cannot advance Transcendence to Stage 2 without ALL chains Stage 2

**Teaching Readiness**:
- Cannot teach (Stage 4 in any chain) without Transcendence Stage 2
- Teaching requires both domain mastery AND wisdom integration

### For Practitioners

**Self-Assessment Questions**:
1. Is my Technology development keeping pace with other chains?
2. Am I respecting hard dependencies before advancing?
3. Is my advancement pattern synchronization or specialization?
4. Are my weak chains supported by external systems?
5. Am I forcing balanced development when specialization better fits?

**Development Priority Tool**:
```
IF Technology Stage 1 incomplete:
   THEN Technology = TOP PRIORITY (everything else blocked)
   
ELIF following Synchronization Track:
   THEN advance weakest chain to synchronize with others
   
ELIF following Specialization Track:
   THEN advance strength chains, maintain baseline in others
   
ELIF Transcendence desired AND substrate insufficient:
   THEN develop prerequisite chains first (don't force wisdom)
```

### For Business Operations

**Consultant Intake Assessment**:
1. What's their Technology Stage? (If Stage 1 incomplete, begin there)
2. What's their natural track? (Synchronization vs. Specialization)
3. What are hard dependency gaps? (Priority remediation)
4. What's their advancement timeline? (Realistic stage progression)

**Curriculum Offering Design**:
- Beginner: Technology Stage 1 + Sensing Stage 1 (3-6 months)
- Intermediate: All chains Stage 1→2 (9-12 months)
- Advanced: Specialization depth or Synchronization breadth (1-2 years)
- Mastery: Teaching practicum + wisdom integration (2-5 years)

## INTEGRATION WITH TRI-HELICAL TIMELINE

The chain dependency logic synchronizes with three developmental timelines:

**Timeline 1: Technological Maturity** (External Pacing Clock)
- Language Models: 85% mature → Technology Stage 1 ready NOW
- Vision/Simulation: 40% → 70% by Month 18 → Technology Stage 2 Month 6+
- Physical/Robotics: 20% → 50% by Year 3-5 → Technology Stage 3 Year 2+

**Timeline 2: Business Development** (Operational Execution)
- Foundation Phase (Months 1-3): Build Technology Stage 1 + content capability
- Validation Phase (Months 4-6): Demonstrate teaching (requires Transcendence Stage 2 minimum)
- Scaling Phase (Months 7-12): Multiple cohorts across chains

**Timeline 3: Personal Capability** (Founder Development)
- Current: Technology Stage 2 beginning, Sensing Stage 2, Efficacy Stage 1, others Stage 1
- Months 1-6: Technology Stage 2, Sensing Stage 2, Efficacy Stage 2, Coherence Stage 2, Embodiment Stage 1, Transcendence Stage 1-2
- Months 6-12: Begin teaching (Transcendence Stage 2 achieved), Technology Stage 2, multiple chains Stage 2
- Year 2+: Technology Stage 3, multiple chains Stage 2-3, teaching maturity

**Synchronization Principle**: Content delivered based on Technology maturity, curriculum gated on personal capability, revenue scales with teaching validation.

## CONCLUSION: DEPENDENCY-AWARE DEVELOPMENT

Understanding chain interdependencies transforms development from haphazard exploration to systematic cultivation. Key recognitions:

**Intelligence Chain Priority**: Begin immediately, maintain continuously—it's both substrate and chain

**Hard Dependencies Matter**: Violating these creates predictable failures requiring remediation

**Soft Dependencies Enhance**: Benefits significant but advancement possible with compensation

**Dual Tracks Legitimate**: Synchronization and Specialization both valid based on cognitive profile

**Stage Gates Protect**: Advancement without prerequisites creates unsafe conditions

**Wisdom Requires Substrate**: Cannot force Transcendence without substantial foundation

**Teaching Needs Integration**: Stage 4 in any chain requires Transcendence Stage 2+ for wisdom-informed transmission

The matrix provides navigation logic. Your cognitive profile, energy capacity, and natural inclinations determine optimal path. The architecture serves you—you don't serve the architecture.

**Engage development systematically. Respect dependencies. Honor your natural pattern. The chains await your cultivation.**
