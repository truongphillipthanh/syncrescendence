Unify these reports. 

Produce the most current, bleeding-edge version of the FLAGSHIP Frontier Model capabilities in order to produce the most efficacious, definitive Frontier Model Comparative Advantage/Teleology artifact. 

Include all impactful frontier labs and Chinese labs. Lead with comparative advantage–the strength(s) in which the model dominates, but it terms of pure achievement, capability,  and/or intelligence, NOT optimization. EXCLUDE ANY ACHIEVEMENTS OF RESOURCE ALLOCATION GAINS. But do highlight weaknesses as well in order to characterize the model holistically. Give it a characterization. 

DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OUTDATED VERSIONS OF MODELS, IF THERE IS A NEW ONE. USE ONLY THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF ANY FLAGSHIP MODEL. DOUBLE CHECK. TRIPLE CHECK.  Today is October 15, 2025.

It should be framed as an index to know which models ARE THE BEST at what. BEST CANNOT MEAN THEY'RE CHEAPER TO USE.

Fomatting:
- Intro
- Each lab gets a section
- Different flagship model PER LAB gets their own subsection
- Conclusion.

Optimize for recursive argumentative coherence, crystallized intellectual density, semantic precision with conceptual resonance, architectonic structural elegance, and efficacy that demonstrates and declares clarity. Draft as though originary, prioritize lucid cogent expression—where form and content achieve mutual necessity.
Revise so that there is no trace or semblance of antithesis or opposition (it's not X, it's/but Y). Optimize in active voice for directness. Prioritize readability and listenability–flow. Cadence and transitions should be fluid, progressive, rhetorical.
This is meant to be used with the 'Read Aloud' feature. Ensure NO inclusion of textual formatting that would impede listenability.
