## The Five-Step Framework for Systemizing a Lean Business

The typical advice for systemizing a business—starting with complex charts, breaking down every task by person, and writing extensive, multi-page templates—often creates more work, which is precisely what busy business owners are trying to avoid. The alternative to this jargon-filled, heavy approach is a simpler, more relaxed, and predictable five-step process for building business systems.

This framework is specifically designed for **lean teams, startups, small business owners (SMBs), and sole proprietors** who seek operational smoothness without sacrificing speed or becoming bogged down by bureaucracy, unread charts, or constant updates. Each step builds upon the last, necessitating a complete understanding of the entire structure for successful implementation.

### Step 1: Define What You Do (The 'What')

The essential first step in building business systems is to accurately capture **what** the business actually does. While this may seem simple for long-established businesses, experience working with over 1,700 companies reveals that relying on memory alone almost always results in forgetting crucial activities, such as client offboarding or supplementary content production.

The goal of this step is to create a comprehensive list or chart outlining **every action** in your business, even those that are not top-of-mind. For instance, managing a YouTube channel can be broken down into three categories of work: **producing videos, editing videos, and publishing videos**.

The ultimate aim is to document everything to ensure all activities can eventually be systemized. This process should be undertaken **iteratively**:
* **Initial Capture:** Record what you do now.
* **Ongoing Observation:** Write down new activities as they arise over the week.
* **Periodic Review:** Brainstorm what was missed a few weeks or months later.

Seeking perfection in the first pass is counterproductive, as virtually no business captures everything accurately the first time. At this stage, the documentation should focus on **high-level categories of work** (e.g., Produce, Edit, Publish). Solopreneurs will likely keep this simple, while more mature businesses may have more detailed, delegated categories. When a process, like editing, applies to multiple areas (e.g., YouTube videos and courses), document them separately for now, with consolidation deferred to a later stage.

### Step 2: Define When You Do It (The 'When')

After defining the "what," the next step is to define the **cadence**, or **frequency**, of these activities—the "when". If a process, such as producing, editing, and publishing a video, is a recurring action, its cadence might be defined as **once a week**.

To organize the expanding volume of information, it is highly recommended to introduce a **task manager** or **work management tool** at this stage. Tools like **ClickUp** and **SmartSuite** are recommended as they facilitate organizing the "what" and allow for the addition of dates without cluttering the calendar.

For non-repeating, on-demand work—such as a sign shop making a sign only when an order arrives—the cadence should be recorded as a **turnaround time**. Examples include "creating customer orders in one week" or "answering emails in one business day". This time-based metric is a valuable tool for later systemization.

### Step 3: Define How You Do It (The 'How')

The third step, the **"how,"** is about executing the processes—the actual **recipes** for what your business does. This is the stage often associated with business systems, but it requires the "what" and the "when" as prerequisites.

The "how" is typically documented using two categories:

#### Process Mapping
This is essentially a **flowchart** that visually represents a process, illustrating complex, branching decisions (If this happens, then that happens). Process maps are best viewed as a **brainstorming tool** or a snapshot in time, rather than a living document requiring sophisticated, ongoing maintenance.

#### Process Equipment
This refers to **living, breathing documents** that are small, easily editable, and accessible within day-to-day tools. These bite-sized pieces are easier to maintain and find than a single, massive process map. Forms of equipment include:
* **Checklists:** Sequential steps for a task (e.g., "before you hit record checklist").
* **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Detailed, step-by-step instructions—the "recipes" (e.g., SOP for publishing a video).
* **Templates:** Copy-and-paste structures (e.g., templated task lists, emails, or pre-set file/folder structures).
* **Decision Trees:** Mini flowcharts to aid in decision-making during unusual situations.

Building business systems often equates to simply creating more **process equipment** to make work easier, faster, and more consistent.

The amount of guidance required is subjective and depends on the business's stage:
* **Goal:** Write down only as much as needed to make work easier, more consistent, and to reduce mistakes.
* **Avoid Over-Systemization:** Do not document everything for the sake of it; time is finite and should be spent on useful documentation.
* **Growth/Delegation:** Businesses with growth goals, an expanding team, or plans for the owner to step back will have a higher threshold for documentation than solopreneurs who plan to be involved daily.

For organization, the instructions and equipment should be placed in the chosen **work management software** for centralized searchability, rather than being scattered across multiple tools like Word or Google Docs.

Finally, it is **not mandatory** to complete all documentation before hiring. A job description often only requires the "what" and "when" (e.g., "produce one video every week"). The "how" can be provided during onboarding and training, or the new hire may bring their own established knowledge.

### Step 4: Define Who Does What (The 'Who')

The fourth step, the **"who,"** is about assigning responsibility for each defined process. While static **reference charts** or job descriptions can define responsibility, a more modern and effective approach is to use the **Assignee Field** within a work management tool.

Responsibilities can be assigned to either:
1.  **Human Names:** (e.g., Layla, Alex).
2.  **Roles:** (e.g., Content Creator, Production Assistant). Assigning by role is a useful way to **future-proof** the system, as it prevents having to update the assignment when personnel change seats.

For the **solopreneur**, documenting the "who" is still valuable, as the owner currently fills every role. Breaking tasks out by job title helps visualize which roles can eventually be delegated to a contractor, an employee, or even an automation/AI tool.

The sequence of this step can shift based on funding:
* **Outside Funding (Venture Capital, Large Loan):** The "who" step should be prioritized first. A well-funded business can hire the right person who will then define the "when" and "how" themselves, essentially creating the systems.
* **Self-Funded (Most Businesses):** The default path is to complete the "what," "when," and "how" first, allowing the business to hire for lower-level execution roles rather than high-cost experts.

### Step 5: Continuous Process Improvement

The final, and perpetual, step in the business systems journey is **improvement**. Systemization is not a one-time switch but an **ongoing organizational fitness** regime, much like physical health. The first four steps build the system's foundation, and this step ensures the ongoing refinement of the "who," "what," "when," and "how".

Three methods for process improvement are:

| Method | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Good: Tracking Ideas** | Log and manage suggestions for new launches, fixes, or better ways of working from team members or internal observations. | An idea to borrow a humorous device from another video. |
| **Better: Tracking Metrics** | Track key business numbers (e.g., 5-10 weekly/monthly). A negative trend line inspires an improvement action. | A drop in thumbnail click-through rate spurs the implementation of split testing in the publishing process. |
| **Best: Tracking Errors** | Log and review all instances where things went wrong to identify and prevent recurring problems. This ensures improvements are based on **actual, known problems** rather than mere hypotheses, which may not be real issues. | A video is published with an audio level error. The mistake is logged, leading to an improvement idea to add a specific "check audio levels" step to the editing checklist. |

The best improvement ideas often reside within the existing team, especially those performing the day-to-day work. While external expertise and consultants can be valuable, they are **not necessary to begin**. By simply capturing the organization's existing, in-house knowledge, a business can become more systemized than the vast majority of competitors.

When all five steps are documented and maintained, the business gains a **game plan** for every situation—it knows what will happen, when, how to handle it, and who is responsible. This preparedness allows the business to run smoothly in both normal and uncertain circumstances. The first four steps establish a baseline foundation, which is a one-time task that is maintained through continuous improvement.
