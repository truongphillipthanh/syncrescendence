If your business can't run without you,
0:01
you have a job, not a business. I was
0:04
shocked to my core when I read this
0:06
quote from Sam Carpenters's book,
0:07
business as a definition implies that
0:09
one does not have to show up in order to
0:11
earn money. And I was like, what do you
0:14
mean? What do you mean? Imagine right
0:16
now in your business, what happens if
0:17
you go right now with no warning and
0:20
take a 7-day vacation. So, if you say
0:21
something to the tune of, "Oh, I think
0:23
my business would burn down. Oh, my
0:24
customers would be furious, potentially
0:26
bankruptcy, all of the above. We're
0:29
going to be fixing this today. In this
0:30
video, I'm going to show you exactly how
0:32
I transformed my 40-hour job into a 200k
0:35
plus business that can operate without
0:37
me if I wanted to. I would say most
0:39
business owners have a business that
0:41
looks a little something like this. They
0:42
are essentially trapped inside the
0:44
swirling chaos tornado of their
0:46
business, right? And everything
0:49
everything
0:51
Hey. Hey. They were trying to mimic the
0:55
chaos tornado for you guys. Okay.
0:59
So all the people are being managed by
1:00
the CEO. Every single task has to be
1:02
approved by the CEO. Everything has to
1:04
flow through you because essentially
1:06
instead of creating the business as a
1:07
separate entity, you are saying you're
1:09
the system. So the cost of not having
 the cost of no systems
1:11
systems is about a million things long.
1:13
Number one, the business only exists in
1:15
the business owner's brain. And that is
1:17
the worst place to store a business.
1:18
There's this great quote from David
1:20
Allen where he says, "The brain is great
1:22
for having ideas, not storing them."
1:23
Number two, it takes way more mental
1:25
energy to accomplish a task because you
1:27
have to manually think about how it gets
1:28
done instead of just having a process,
1:30
having a system that you can follow
1:32
every single time. If every single time
1:34
I make a thumbnail, I have to think,
1:35
okay, what's the first step again? Okay,
1:37
I have to do this. Okay. And then, oh
1:39
yeah, and then I can't forget that.
1:40
Okay. Okay. I can't forget that. Okay.
1:42
That's chaos. We don't want that. Third
1:44
thing is if you don't have processes,
1:46
you don't have systems, you cannot
1:47
delegate anything properly, which means
1:50
you can't hire and outsource, which
1:51
means you cannot scale, which means you
1:53
are on your own forever. I know a lot of
1:56
business owners do this. Instead of
1:57
creating systems and processes, they
1:59
just think hiring is the answer. Let me
2:00
just hire people, a bunch of people
2:01
really quick. And because all the
2:02
processes live in their brain, and they
2:04
don't know how to properly hand it over
2:06
to the people that they hire, the people
2:07
that they hire then don't do as good of
2:09
a job as they want them to do. The
2:11
fourth thing, this drives me crazy.
2:12
Inconsistent output and quality and
2:14
potentially costly mistakes happen,
2:16
right? Have you ever been to a cafe?
2:21
Have you ever been to a cafe where you
2:22
just know they do not have systems or
2:24
processes in place? It drives me nuts.
2:27
Sometimes I go to the same cafe and one
2:29
day I'll order matcha and it will be
2:31
like sugared milk. Like there's no
2:33
matcha. It doesn't there's not even a
2:35
whiff of greenness in the matcha. And
2:37
then another day I'll go and the matcha
2:39
will like knock me out for seven
2:41
business days. That shows me immediately
2:43
there's no process. There's no training
2:45
happening. We want when customers come
2:47
to buy our products or services that
2:48
they know what to expect. Now I go to a
2:50
cafe where I see them every time they
2:53
make my matcha. They put the cup on a
2:56
scale and then they start doing the
2:58
matcha and they're weighing exactly how
2:59
much matcha is in the cup. And that is
3:01
why I go back to them over and over and
3:03
over again now because I know every
3:05
single time I'm going to have a banging
3:06
matcha. So this is essentially what we
3:08
want ideally. We want to pull you out of
3:10
the system so it doesn't depend on you.
3:12
You can just look at it from above but
3:14
all of them will operate on their own
3:16
without your input without everybody
3:18
asking you a million questions about is
3:20
this correct or do can you approve this
3:21
or what about this and is this okay and
3:23
all this stuff. Okay. So we're going to
3:24
have our big systems our first layer of
3:26
systems. Then we're going to have our
3:28
subsystems and then we're going to have
3:29
processes and that's what we're talking
3:30
about in this video. Okay. And the best
3:32
news is once you have this system, this
3:34
is when you can perfectly start to
3:36
delegate. Another great quote from the
3:38
book Work the System is your task as a
3:41
CEO is to optimize one system after
3:43
another, not carine through the day
3:44
randomly taking care of whatever
3:46
problems erupt. Your job is not to be a
3:48
fire killer. Your job is to prevent
3:51
fires from happening in the first place.
3:53
And if you're thinking, "Oh my gosh,
3:54
that's me. I'm currently the person that
3:56
randomly goes through and tries to fix
3:58
everything. You are not alone. That is
4:00
the case for most business owners out
4:01
there and that is what we're trying to
4:02
solve. So don't worry. Okay. So first
 what even is a system?
4:04
let's even define the word system
4:06
because I feel like a lot of times
4:07
people talk about it but they don't
4:08
really define exactly what they think it
4:10
is. And obviously lots of people have
4:11
different definitions but what I think
4:13
they are is a collection of repeatable
4:15
processes designed to produce consistent
4:18
results without starting from scratch
4:19
each time and to reach a specific goal.
4:22
So let's break that down. So let's say
4:23
the system of creating weekly YouTube
4:26
videos. The repeatable processes within
4:28
that system are how you track video
4:30
ideas, how you share files with your
4:31
video editor, how you upload videos, how
4:33
you do your intros, how you script
4:35
certain parts of your videos. The
4:37
consistent results we want there are
4:38
consistent professional optimized
4:40
videos, right? And the specific goal
4:42
that this system is pushing us towards
4:44
is to grow our channel and build a
4:46
personal brand on YouTube. Okay. What
4:48
about another system? A teeth system.
4:50
So, the repeatable processes within the
4:52
system of your teeth, right? How you
4:54
brush your teeth, do you go left to
4:55
right, up or down, how often you brush
4:57
your teeth, how you floss, whether you
4:59
floss. Um, if you use those little
5:01
interd dental brushes that your dentist
5:03
always tells you to do, but you just
5:04
really hate using them. Um, whether you
5:06
book your dentist appointments, those
5:08
are all little processes within the
5:10
system of teeth, right? The consistent
5:11
result we want is clean teeth. And the
5:14
specific goal that this is achieving is
5:16
no cavities, which is the biggest win of
5:18
all really. So there are lots of
5:20
different types of systems, right? You
5:22
can have personal systems like for your
5:23
health, like your morning routine could
5:25
be a system. How your exercise routine
5:27
is a system. How you meal prep is
5:29
definitely a system. You could have
5:31
money systems like how you budget, how
5:33
you spend, how you invest. You can also
5:35
have business systems, right? Content
5:36
creation, how you post to Instagram, how
5:38
you create content or product
5:39
fulfillment, like how do you fulfill
5:41
your service actually step by step. How
5:43
do you onboard clients step by step? How
5:44
do you offboard clients step by step?
5:46
How do you handle conflict with your
5:48
clients step by step? So really, and
5:50
this is something I love to say is that
5:52
everything is a system. And once you
5:53
have that systems mindset, everywhere
5:56
you look, you're like, everything's a
5:57
system. Like looking at my phone, I'm
5:58
like the the process of creating my
6:01
phone is such a system. They need to do
6:04
it so step by step. Otherwise, everyone
6:05
would get a different phone. Another
6:07
example, I was thinking about this
6:09
non-stop when I was looking at Taylor
6:10
Swift's era store. collection of
6:12
processes for outfits, the multiple
6:13
outfit changes, for preparing outfits
6:15
for the stage setup. I mean, if you've
6:17
looked at the stage setup, I think they
6:19
have four replicas of that same stage
6:21
that they were like, it took them two
6:22
weeks to set up and then like they had
6:24
to take it down, then drive it to the
6:25
next city, and then the second stage
6:27
would be setting up, and then she would
6:28
perform on that one, and then that one
6:29
would go like they had an entire
6:31
logistical system for how they got those
6:33
stages set up. Even just one process,
6:35
like for example, we just imagine she
6:36
changes outfits so fast. They probably
6:38
have some sort of process for changing
6:39
all these. Like for example, assistant A
6:40
receives Q and earpiece. Then assistant
6:41
B arranges the outfit at the quick
6:43
change station. Taylor enters the area.
6:44
Assistants begin removing outfit top
6:46
down. Then they remove the earpiece
6:47
pack. Hands to audio tag. Audio tech
6:48
changes battery pack. They style helper
6:49
step. Like there must be that process.
6:51
The fact that 150 shows almost all went
6:53
off identically is insane and really
6:56
just shows the level of the system that
6:58
was working behind the scenes. And if
7:00
you get this meme, you get this meme. If
7:02
you don't, I'm sorry. So if it wasn't
7:05
clear by now, first you work your
7:06
system, then your systems do the work.
7:08
So systems that you might have in your
7:10
business might be things like marketing,
7:12
right? How do you do all the marketing
7:14
things so that people actually see your
7:16
products and services? How do you handle
7:18
your team? How do you handle all the
7:19
little bits and pieces to hiring and
7:21
training and onboarding? Product, how do
7:22
you actually fulfill your product and
7:24
make sure that clients are happy, right?
7:25
And then you might have subsystems
7:27
within those systems. So you might have
7:28
within marketing, social media, paid
7:30
ads, affiliates. Within team, you might
7:33
have subsystems like how you hire, how
7:35
you handle payroll, how you handle
7:36
software for managing the team. And then
7:38
within product, you might have
7:39
subsystems like your course and you have
7:42
a community and how you handle tech
7:43
support or something like that. And then
7:45
within those systems, you have your
7:47
processes, right? For example, and I
7:49
mean it might be way more than this, but
7:50
for example, how we film and edit
7:52
Instagram reels, how we set up Facebook
7:54
ads, how we edit weekly newsletters.
7:56
Within team, you might have processes
7:58
like how we grant access to team files,
8:00
how we pay contractors, how we conduct
8:02
weekly meetings, how we hire people, how
8:05
we send them contracts, how we send them
8:06
NDAs. It's a million things, right? And
8:09
if you're like, Da, that's a lot of
8:10
stuff. Yeah, you're right. And guess
8:12
where all of that is right now? It's in
8:15
your brain. And if you're like, yeah,
8:17
but DEA, then everything still flows
8:19
through me. I have a solution for that
8:21
at the end of the video. We still have
8:22
to cover the details first. Okay, so the
 step 1
8:24
agenda here. So, let's dive into
8:26
actually creating the system now. So,
8:28
step one is we're going to brain dump
8:30
everything that you're casually storing
8:31
in your brain out. This does not need to
8:33
have any rhyme or reason to it. I just
8:35
want you to think of everything
8:36
essentially you do recurringly in your
8:38
business daily, weekly, monthly, and
8:40
just write them all out. Now, I would
8:41
recommend brain dumping into a table or
8:43
spreadsheet because of all the steps
8:44
that we're about to do together. I'm
8:46
going to be doing it in a notion table.
8:48
And yes, there is a template. And yes,
8:51
you can have the template for free, but
8:53
only if you do the pop quiz that I'm
8:55
linking down below. I want to make sure
8:56
you're paying attention, not just
8:57
downloading a bunch of free stuff and
8:58
not doing anything with it. I only want
9:00
people who are serious about creating
9:02
systems to get this template. That is
9:03
why there's a pop quiz. Now, you might
9:05
be thinking, "Okay, Dia, I brain dumped
9:06
as much as I could, but I still feel
9:08
like there are things I'm forgetting
9:09
that aren't in here." That's totally
9:10
fine. Every time you come across the
9:12
task that's not in here, just go into
9:14
the notion and then add it in. And then
9:15
I'm just going to add quickly what
9:17
system it's a part of and the frequency
9:19
of the system. So, how often do I do it?
9:21
Do I do it every single week, every
9:23
single day, bi-weekly, monthly,
9:24
quarterly? Just add that in there. All
 step 2
9:26
right. The next thing we're going to
9:27
want to do is now score things. Again,
9:30
there are a million tasks that we do
9:31
within our business, a million projects
9:33
going on. We can't be like, "Okay, now
9:35
they're all equally important tasks, and
9:37
we're now going to have to create
9:38
processes for all of them at the same
9:39
time." So that's why we're going to
9:41
score and we're going to create
9:42
processes for the most important things
9:44
that you do in your business that are
9:46
the easiest to create processes and
9:48
systems out of essentially. So this is
9:49
the formula that I came up with. So let
9:51
me just walk you through it. Frequency
9:52
is basically how often you do it. The
9:54
more often you do something, the more
9:55
important it is for us to create a
9:57
process out of it. The next thing that I
9:58
want you to score is annoyance on a
10:00
scale of 1 to five. How annoying is this
10:02
thing to you? One being like, I'm
10:04
totally good. I could do this a million
10:06
times. I'm totally fine. It's not
10:08
annoying at all. Five being I would
10:10
rather go on the stairmaster than do
10:13
this task. All right, the next thing is
10:14
impact. And by impact I mean impact on
10:16
your business goals. So if your business
10:18
goal is to I don't know hit six figures
10:19
this year, how important is this task to
10:22
getting you there? And this is also a
10:23
good way to audit all the things you're
10:25
doing and be like, okay, if I'm scoring
10:26
something zero impact or one impact, why
10:29
am I doing it? The next thing we're
10:30
going to score is simplicity. So
10:32
simplicity is just how simple is the
10:34
task? How easy is it to give it to
10:35
somebody else? How easy is it to create
10:37
a process out of that? So, for example,
10:39
the process of how to create an invoice
10:41
for a customer in our business is very
10:43
easy, right? Step one, duplicate our
10:45
invoice template. Step two, copy the
10:46
customer information into the invoice.
10:48
Step three, make sure that the quantity
10:49
is the right amount. Step four, send it
10:50
to it's like very step by step. That's a
10:52
very simple process. So, for a task like
10:54
how to send a customer an invoice, the
10:56
simplicity might be five because it's
10:58
super simple. A more complicated process
11:00
is for example, how we ideulate for
11:02
YouTube videos. That's way more
11:04
complicated. Anything that involves more
11:05
creativity, more strategy, more like
11:08
brainstorming, thinking kind of task is
11:12
a lot more complicated to hand off. Once
11:14
you score those four things, you will
11:16
get a delegation priority score auto
11:19
calculated your DPS and we want a high
11:23
DPS. So, if you are using my notion
11:26
template because you did the pop quiz
11:28
and I'm proud of you, then all you have
11:29
to do is up here once you finish step
11:32
one, go to step two. And something fun
11:34
that I did, if I do say so myself, is I
11:36
made it so that when you select the
11:38
frequency, like weekly, daily,
11:39
bi-weekly, or whatever, it automatically
11:41
creates a number for that instead. So,
11:43
we can use it in our formula. So, you
11:45
don't even have to fill in the frequency
11:47
number. All right. Amazing. So, we've
11:49
scored everything. And essentially, what
11:52
you'll already start seeing populate is
11:54
your delegation priority score. This is
11:56
the magic equation that I came up with.
11:58
But again, you can change it if you're
12:00
like, I want to prioritize processes or
12:02
systems in a different way. That's fine.
12:04
But essentially, what I have it is
12:05
frequency plus annoyance plus impact
12:07
plus simplicity of task divided by four.
12:10
So the average essentially gives you a
12:12
delegation priority score. And if you're
12:14
using the notion because you did the pop
12:16
quiz and you were a good student, this
12:20
will automatically be calculated for
12:22
you, which is very exciting. And if we
12:24
score it descendingly, then we will
12:27
already notice what we need to create
12:29
processes for first. Okay, so it's time
12:32
for a roadblock mini audit situation.
12:35
Now that you have all the tasks listed
12:36
out, you have all the scores, I invite
12:38
you to have a little look at a few
12:39
things. If it's low impact busy work,
12:42
potentially you can delete it. So I
12:44
would just double check. Maybe it has
12:45
impact for something else. Maybe it's
12:47
like a long game thing you're doing. If
12:49
that's the case, that's totally fine.
12:50
But if it's like low impact busy work
12:52
that someone's doing and it's not really
12:53
important, this is an opportunity to be
12:56
like, we can stop doing that. If there
12:58
is a tool out there that can get a task
13:00
that you do regularly done, you have
13:02
somebody manually taking the payment
13:04
processing customer info and typing it
13:06
into a CRM in Air Table. There's a zap
13:10
for that. Zapier is amazing for that. Go
13:12
check out Zapier. It will automatically
13:13
zap between two tools information. Next
13:16
one. If it's impactful but super
13:18
annoying and someone else can do it like
13:21
80 to 90% as well as you because the
13:23
simplicity is pretty high, then this is
13:25
a great opportunity to document it,
13:27
which we're going to talk about in a
13:28
second, and delegate it. Okay, so we've
 step 3
13:31
scored. Now, step three is owners. And I
13:34
love I love this game. I love this
13:36
question. So, the owners part of this is
13:40
and if you're using my notion, all you
13:42
have to do is just go on over and click
13:43
the step three tab. I mean, if this is
13:46
not a plug for studying, taking notes on
13:49
my videos, and doing the pop quiz, and
13:51
getting the notion because it's
13:52
perfectly laid out for you, I don't know
13:54
what is. So, go to step three. And at
13:56
this stage, what you're going to do is
13:58
you're going to put down who the current
13:59
owner of this task is. And the best
14:02
part, the ideal owner of this task.
14:05
Okay? So, the current owner, if you're
14:07
currently alone in your business, the
14:08
current owner, it's all you, right? So
14:10
annoying. Now, we're going to put in the
14:12
ideal owner. Okay? And this is a really
14:14
good opportunity to look at what you
14:17
actually want to do in your business and
14:18
what you don't. And I'm not saying that
14:20
if you put ideal owner someone else, you
14:22
have to give that task up right away.
14:23
This is just kind of like a romanticized
14:25
ideal perfect. If you could wave a magic
14:27
wand, who would be in charge of each of
14:30
these tasks? And it's possible all of
14:32
the ideal owners aren't you? I want you
14:34
to essentially dream big. Let yourself
14:36
dream for a second and just be like, who
14:37
is the ideal owner? And I feel like we
14:39
don't ask CEOs that enough of like if
14:42
you didn't have to do everything, what
14:44
would you choose to do in your business?
14:46
This is the opportunity to answer that
14:48
question. And at this stage, if you're
14:50
like, "Okay, D, but I don't have any
14:51
team members. What should I put an ideal
14:53
owner?" This is my favorite part because
14:55
I feel like at this stage, you can start
14:57
thinking about who you might hire to
14:59
fill some of these things, right? So,
15:01
who would be the person that could do
15:03
this task? For example, I have this task
15:05
here. check Slack community and respond
15:07
to all unread questions and threads. I
15:09
feel like somebody that could do that
15:10
task that's not currently on my team
15:12
would be like a program assistant, a
15:14
program manager, a customer support
15:17
person maybe or like uh an external
15:20
coach I could hire into my system to
15:21
help students with their questions and
15:23
concerns. So I might put something like
15:25
program assistant or manager. So now we
 step 4
15:28
finished dumping everything we can think
15:30
of scoring. We've put in the owners. Now
15:33
we can start to think about who that
15:35
first hire might be, how we might
15:37
outsource to them, how we might delegate
15:39
to them. And that is why the next step
15:41
is probably arguably the most important
15:42
one and that is to document. Right?
15:44
Before we delegate, we always want to
15:46
document. We don't want to just hire a
15:47
bunch of people on and they're like,
15:49
"How do you do these things in your
15:50
business?" And we're like, "I don't
15:51
know, figure it out." So a quick audit
15:53
before we document. I want you to run
15:56
through these things. Do you currently
15:57
already have a checklist that you
15:58
follow? If yes, that's a great place to
16:00
work off of. Also making templates for
16:02
anything repeatable, customer emails,
16:04
YouTube descriptions, Instagram
16:06
graphics, anything that you do and
16:08
you're like, "Oh yeah, this could easily
16:09
be a template." Like for example, if you
16:10
have a customer support inbox, it's very
16:12
easy the next time you send you get a
16:14
frequently asked question and you write
16:16
a response, just copy that into a
16:18
document and title it frequently asked
16:19
questions that customers ask me and then
16:21
put in the question, put in your
16:23
response, right? And then next time you
16:24
can just copy that and then make some
16:26
changes and you don't always have to
16:27
start from scratch, right? Okay. So
16:29
making templates is really good. Audit
16:30
your tools. Are you using too many
16:32
tools? I would say most business owners
16:33
are. And next audit point. For every
16:36
step that you are documenting, ask why.
16:38
Do you really need it or is it just how
16:40
you've always done things? All right,
16:41
step four. Now we're getting to
16:43
documenting. And again, I'm not saying
16:44
you have to document every single task
16:46
that's in your system spreadsheet right
16:47
now. I'm saying you should prioritize
16:49
the top ones, right? The ones that we
16:50
can give away first potentially. So, you
16:52
can choose your method here. There are
16:54
lots of different things. You can do a
16:55
video walkthrough, which is my personal
16:56
favorite. You can use something like
16:57
Loom or Vimeo, any tool that allows you
17:00
to screen record your screen and your
17:02
microphone at the same time so you can
17:04
explain what you're doing. You can do a
17:05
written step-by-step process or
17:07
checklist if you want or advance.
17:10
Sometimes I include this if the task is
17:12
like I said a little bit more complex. I
17:14
might include something like a decision
17:15
tree like how I make a decision in this
17:18
process. So for example like with video
17:20
ideas like which ideas do we pick to
17:23
create YouTube videos out of? Because we
17:24
ideulate so much. I might create a
17:26
decision tree like has this been
17:28
validated by this or this? Have we done
17:30
this before recently? This or this? Is
17:32
it related to this topic? I might do
17:33
something like that if it's super
17:35
complicated. My best tips before you
17:37
document is number one, prep before you
17:39
start recording. Just like have a little
17:41
list of like things you definitely want
17:42
to cover and you don't want to forget.
17:44
It's also always good to show an example
17:45
of how it's done and keep it as simple
17:48
as possible. Don't go off on rambling
17:50
tangents if they're not necessary. I
17:52
really like using video to document
17:54
processes because I feel like then when
17:56
you give it to someone, they can
17:57
re-watch it as often as they want.
17:59
That's so different to showing someone
18:00
how to do something like via Zoom. And
18:02
there also a lot of tools out there that
18:04
can take your video walkthrough and turn
18:06
it into written checklists or steps that
18:08
you can then use as written
18:09
documentation as well. So I feel like
18:10
video is just the best thing to start
18:12
with and they can watch it on 2x 1.5x.
18:15
So it's really customizable to whatever
18:16
this person needs. So now we'll move on
18:19
to step four in the notion, right? And
18:20
looking at the scoring, I'm like, "Oh,
18:23
these two tasks, if the ideal owner was
18:26
somebody else and the current owner was
18:27
still me, those are the tasks I would
18:29
prioritize giving to someone else
18:30
first." So, this is what we want, right?
18:32
We want the systems, the subsystems, the
18:34
processes. We want the processes
18:36
documented when we want to figure out
18:38
what might be the first things we want
18:39
to outsource for. If you notice that a
18:41
bunch of tasks at the top of your
18:42
priority list, which is like taking up a
18:44
lot of your time and energy, are things
18:46
that can easily be handed off to a VA,
18:48
then that might be the first hire. And
18:49
what's cool about this system is once
18:51
you have it and you hire someone new,
18:52
let's say say you have a bunch of tasks
18:54
that's for ideal owner virtual assistant
18:56
and you hire someone like Sandy for
18:58
virtual assistant, you can just change
18:59
virtual assistant in the notion to Sandy
19:02
and then Sandy can come in here and
19:04
filter by Sandy and she'll see all the
19:07
things that you want her to take over
19:08
and all the videos of exactly how to do
19:11
those tasks and how often they are done.
19:14
That is so if I were hired onto
19:16
someone's team and they sent me this and
19:18
they were like, "Here are the things I
19:19
would love for you to take over. Here's
19:20
the frequency of when they're done and
19:22
here's exactly a video of exactly how to
19:23
do every single task."
19:26
That's life-changing. That's
19:28
life-changing onboarding. Okay, I'm
19:30
sorry. And then I would have something
19:32
in my system that's like last updated so
19:35
that it's when the last time you filmed
19:37
the video is and then regularly maybe
19:39
quarterly. You can have someone, more on
19:42
that in a second, checks when the
19:43
processes were last updated and then ask
19:46
people to update them if it's been too
19:48
long. Let's say it's been 2 years since
19:49
a process has been updated. I would just
19:51
ask them to update it and refilm a
19:53
video. And once you have team members,
19:55
they're the ones that should be filming
19:57
the process videos, not you, because
19:59
you're not doing the task anymore.
20:00
Whoever is doing the task most currently
20:03
should be filming the process videos. So
20:04
at this stage, if you're like, "Okay,
20:05
Dia, this is really great. I love this,
20:08
but I still don't want to be the person
20:10
in charge of everything, in charge of
20:12
all the systems, in charge of making
20:13
sure the processes are updated, in
20:15
charge of making sure people are doing
20:16
what they're supposed to be doing, in
20:17
charge of hiring all these people and
20:18
onboarding and training all this. Guess
20:20
what? I have a solution. You can hire a
20:23
digital business manager." This is the
20:25
role that I think a lot of business
20:26
owners don't realize exists and would
20:28
solve most of their problems. digital
20:29
business managers. I train them in
20:31
project team and systems management.
20:32
They know how to create systems. They
20:34
know how to create processes. They know
20:35
how to get the team to do these
20:37
processes. A DBM is a fantastic hire.
20:40
They can be the buffer between you and
20:42
the system if that's what you want. If
20:43
you're like, no, I want to be the one
20:45
managing. That's great. That's totally
20:46
fine. But if you're like, I don't want
20:47
to be the person in charge because if I
20:49
go on vacation, who's going to be
20:52
monitoring the business? The digital
20:53
business manager can be doing that. The
20:55
business managers I train are
20:56
incredible. So, I highly encourage you
20:58
to check it out and see if that might be
21:00
a good hire for you at your stage of
 step 5
21:02
your business. And finally, we get to
21:04
mysterious step number five, and that is
21:08
you going on vacation. Because guess
21:10
what? After you create the system, you
21:12
will be able to. How exciting is that?
21:15
So exciting. And now, if there's a
21:17
little voice inside of you that's
21:19
saying, "Okay, but if I'm not doing
21:21
tasks in my business, I'm not going to
21:22
be productive. Is that okay? Is that
21:24
allowed? Am I allowed to not work 40
21:26
hours? Am I allowed to not work 30 hours
21:28
in my business? What does that say about
21:30
me? Am I going to be lazy? I feel like
21:32
I'm not doing enough. What if I hand off
21:33
all these things and I'm not doing
21:34
anything in my business? What then?
21:38
Watch this video. This video helped me
21:40
be okay with working less than 40 hours
21:43
a week. Again, if you want the notion
21:44
template, do the pop quiz. It's down
21:46
below. Do it. You'll have it for free.
21:49
And as always, thank you so much for
21:50
watching and I hope to catch you in the
21:52
next one. Okay. Bye.
