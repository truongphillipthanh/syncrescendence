## Installation (5 Minutes)

1. **Create Claude Project**
   - Go to claude.ai
   - Click Projects → New Project
   - Name: "ToolCraft Ontology"

2. **Install System Prompt**
   - Copy SYSTEM_PROMPT.md contents
   - Paste in Project → Custom Instructions
   - Save

3. **Upload Knowledge Files**
   - Upload to Project Knowledge:
     * THEORETICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md
     * TAXONOMIES.md
     * RESEARCH_PROTOCOLS.md
     * IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
   - Claude will RAG these automatically

4. **Create Personal Ontology** (optional but recommended)
   - Use template in IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
   - Document your identity, context, processes
   - Upload to Project Knowledge

## The Six Operating Modes

Claude operates in explicit modes. You can request switches or Claude will announce automatically.

| Mode | When to Use | Output |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **EXEGESIS** | Processing new context, understanding fragmentary research | Hyper-coherent narrative with glossary, claim ledger |
| **RESEARCH** | Investigating claims, frontier validation | Research report, log, frontier map |
| **DISTILLATION** | Reducing to primitives, creating successor prompts | Reproducible task graphs, encoded prompts |
| **SYNTHESIS** | Building final outputs, creating treatise | Mechanism-driven narrative with integration tests |
| **ATLAS** | Developing taxonomies, classification systems | Operational typologies with examples |
| **SALVAGE** | Triaging legacy work, consolidation planning | Keep/refactor/retire plan with migrations |

## The Three Axioms (Always Reference)

### Axiom 1: Displacement Mechanism
Intelligence displaces tools by collapsing the means-ends distinction. AI doesn't augment—it fundamentally decomposes and redistributes functions.

### Axiom 2: Intent Architecture Primacy
Human cognitive work = hierarchical intent (Vision → Mission → Strategy → Projects → Processes → Tasks → Operations). Personal Ontology formalizes this.

### Axiom 3: Phase Transition Law
Adoption stages: Pre-Integration → Copiloting → Delegation → Symbiosis → Autonomy. Each requires different cognitive architecture.

## The Three Work Modes (Invariant Patterns)

### CREATION (Potential → Actual)
Bringing new artifacts into existence. Human: vision, taste, approval. AI: execution, iteration, exploration.

### TRANSFORMATION (Actual → Refined)
Improving existing artifacts. Human: judgment about "better", approval gates. AI: analysis, optimization, variants.

### COMPREHENSION (Complexity → Clarity)
Understanding information. Human: right questions, integration into worldview. AI: research, analysis, synthesis, explanation.

## Quick Start Patterns

### Pattern 1: Content Creation
```
1. Specify: "Write [type] about [topic] for [audience], goal: [X], tone: [Y]"
2. Generate: Review AI's draft
3. Select: "Section 2 works, but needs more examples"
4. Refine: Iterate until complete
```

### Pattern 2: Research Question
```
1. Frame: "I need to understand [X] to decide [Y]"
2. AI researches with source triad method
3. Dive deeper on interesting threads
4. Conclude with actionable understanding
```

### Pattern 3: Process Documentation
```
1. Describe workflow to Claude
2. Claude extracts structure (Area → System → Process → Activity → Task)
3. Identify automation opportunities
4. Design handoffs and checkpoints
```

## Common Commands

```
"Enter RESEARCH MODE to investigate [claim]"
"Switch to ATLAS MODE to develop taxonomy for [domain]"
"Enter EXEGESIS MODE to process these materials"
"What mode are you in? What's our current state?"
```

## Key Quality Heuristics

**Excellent work:**
- Predicts phenomena before they emerge
- Reveals non-obvious connections
- Simplifies without losing complexity
- Enables action, not just understanding
- Organized around invariants, not artifacts

**Poor work:**
- Describes without explaining mechanism
- Organized around current tools
- Abstract without grounding
- Arbitrary or ad-hoc

## The One Decisive Question Rule

Claude asks **at most one** question when ambiguity would materially change outcomes. Otherwise, states assumption and proceeds. Favor execution.

## Decision Delta Obligation

Every inclusion must answer: **"If this is true, what changes?"**

No decorative research. Each claim must alter a decision.

## The Meta-Principle

Traditional: "How do we adapt tools for AI?"

**Our inversion**: "How do we formalize human intentionality such that intelligence can mediate it?"

Tools are temporary. Intent structure is permanent. Build on the invariant.

## Measuring Success

- **Time saved**: Track before/after on common tasks
- **Quality maintained/improved**: Compare outputs
- **Capability expanded**: Can do what previously required expertise
- **Agency preserved**: Human remains in control
- **Integration natural**: Doesn't feel forced

## Getting Help

**If Claude seems confused:**
- Check what mode it's in
- Provide more context about current goal
- Reference specific axioms or frameworks
- Request mode switch if needed

**If quality is poor:**
- Review quality heuristics with Claude
- Provide concrete examples of good/bad
- Clarify success criteria
- Ask for dialectical critique

**If stuck:**
- Read relevant knowledge file section
- Try different mode
- Start with simpler version
- Ask Claude to explain its reasoning

## Evolution

This system evolves through use. Document what works, extend taxonomies, refine frameworks. The goal is continuous improvement toward human-AI cognitive symbiosis.

## Ultimate Vision

**Short-term**: Effective copiloting, 30-50% time savings
**Medium-term**: Process delegation, 60-80% savings, seamless mode-switching
**Long-term**: Symbiotic collaboration, work at higher abstraction, AI handles tactical/operational
**Horizon**: Intelligence implements intent directly

**The displacement has begun. Navigate it with intentionality.**
