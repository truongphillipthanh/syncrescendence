# ToolCraft Intelligence Architecture

**The Ultimate System for Human-AI Cognitive Symbiosis**

## What This Is

This is a complete system for architecting, implementing, and evolving personal cognitive work in the age of AI displacement. It represents the unification of multiple theoretical frameworks into a single, coherent approach optimized for Claude Projects.

## The Architecture

### Core Philosophy

Traditional question: "How do we adapt tools for AI?"

**Our inversion**: "How do we formalize human intentionality such that intelligence can mediate it?"

Tools are temporary. Intent structure is permanent. **Build on the invariant.**

### The System Components

This system is intentionally **bifurcated** for optimal Claude Project performance:

#### 1. SYSTEM_PROMPT.md (Active in Every Interaction)
The focused, actionable system prompt that goes into your Claude Project settings. Contains:
- Core identity and prime directive
- Three foundational axioms
- Six operating modes (explicit switching)
- Interaction protocols
- Quality heuristics
- Success criteria

**This stays always active.** It's your Claude's operational identity.

#### 2. THEORETICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md (RAG'd When Needed)
Deep mechanisms and frameworks. Contains:
- Displacement topology (three vectors)
- Personal Ontology (four subsystems)
- Maturity model (five phases)
- Three fundamental work modes
- Scale spectrum (five dimensions)

**Reference this when:** Validating frameworks, understanding mechanisms, exploring phase transitions.

#### 3. TAXONOMIES.md (RAG'd When Needed)
Complete operational typologies. Contains:
- ASA-Expanded architecture
- Work typology (nested hierarchy)
- Modality families (production patterns)
- Production complexity continua
- Consumption/PKM ladders
- Apparatus patterns
- Scale attributes

**Reference this when:** Developing classifications, mapping workflows, designing systems.

#### 4. RESEARCH_PROTOCOLS.md (RAG'd When Needed)
Methodologies and quality standards. Contains:
- Source triad method
- Verdicting process
- Frontier tracking
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Research output formats

**Reference this when:** Conducting research, evaluating claims, tracking developments.

#### 5. IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (RAG'd When Needed)
Practical patterns and playbooks. Contains:
- Getting started steps
- Workflow patterns by mode
- Maturity phase transitions
- Common challenges and solutions
- Example implementations
- Measurement and iteration

**Reference this when:** Implementing workflows, solving problems, measuring progress.

## How to Use This System

### For Claude Project Setup

**Step 1: Create the Project**
1. Open Claude.ai
2. Create new Project
3. Name it "ToolCraft Ontology" (or your preference)

**Step 2: Install System Prompt**
1. Copy the contents of `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`
2. Paste into Project's custom instructions
3. Save

**Step 3: Add Knowledge Files**
1. Upload these files to Project Knowledge:
   - THEORETICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md
   - TAXONOMIES.md
   - RESEARCH_PROTOCOLS.md
   - IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
2. Claude will automatically RAG these when relevant

**Step 4: Add Your Personal Ontology**
1. Follow the template in IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (Section I, Step 1)
2. Create your Personal Ontology document
3. Upload to Project Knowledge
4. Update as you evolve

### For Effective Interaction

**Claude will announce its mode** at the start of each interaction:

```
MODE: EXEGESIS
Current focus: Processing fragmentary research on agentic workflows
Next: Extract to axioms, validate coherence
```

**You can request mode switches**:
- "Enter RESEARCH MODE to investigate this claim"
- "Switch to SYNTHESIS MODE to create the final treatise"
- "Enter SALVAGE MODE to triage these legacy documents"

**Claude will maintain state**:
- What mode it's in
- Latest deltas (what changed)
- Risks (what could go wrong)
- Next irreversible step (what's about to happen)

### For Different Use Cases

#### If You're Starting Fresh
1. Read IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md Section I (Getting Started)
2. Create your Personal Ontology
3. Start with Copiloting phase patterns
4. Iterate weekly

#### If You're Conducting Research
1. Read RESEARCH_PROTOCOLS.md
2. Formulate decision-bearing questions
3. Enter RESEARCH MODE
4. Follow source triad method
5. Produce verdicts with design deltas

#### If You're Building Taxonomies
1. Read THEORETICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md for axioms
2. Review existing TAXONOMIES.md for patterns
3. Enter ATLAS MODE
4. Develop with: definition, criteria, tests, anti-examples, use-cases

#### If You're Writing the Treatise
1. Ensure all prior modes complete
2. Review all accumulated work
3. Enter SYNTHESIS MODE
4. Build hierarchically: axioms → frameworks → implications
5. Include integration tests

## The Unification Story

This system represents the synthesis of **four distinct approaches** from leading LLMs, each contributing unique insights:

**ChatGPT's Contribution**: Structured deliverables, data contracts, explicit acceptance rubrics, switchboard mode system, versioning and traceability

**Claude's Contribution**: Meta-critique identifying category errors, displacement mechanism primacy, intent architecture, phase transition model, focus on invariants over artifacts

**Gemini's Contribution**: Noetic Engineering framing, recursive cycles over linear phases, dialectical progression mandate, semantic transmutation emphasis, elegant granularity principle

**Grok's Contribution**: Retrospective 2030 hindsight perspective, autopoietic systems thinking, quantum-inspired language, morphogenetic evolution, existential dimension

**The Ultimate Synthesis**: Preserves all productive tensions, maintains all perspectives, optimizes for Claude Project architecture, provides both theoretical depth and practical action.

## Key Innovations

### 1. Bifurcated Architecture
- **System Prompt**: Focused, always-active operational identity
- **Knowledge Files**: Deep content, RAG'd when relevant
- **Result**: Best of both worlds—immediate guidance + comprehensive depth

### 2. Explicit Mode Switching
Rather than implicit context shifts, Claude **announces and operates in explicit modes**:
- EXEGESIS: Processing and understanding
- RESEARCH: Investigating and validating
- DISTILLATION: Reducing to primitives
- SYNTHESIS: Building final outputs
- ATLAS: Developing taxonomies
- SALVAGE: Triaging legacy work

### 3. Generative Taxonomies
Not just descriptive categories, but **frameworks that predict** future states:
- Built on invariants (intent structures), not artifacts (current tools)
- Accommodate evolution without fundamental restructure
- Generate new categories as patterns emerge

### 4. Phase Transition Model
Clear developmental stages with **transition protocols**:
- Pre-Integration → Copiloting → Delegation → Symbiosis → Autonomy
- Each phase has characteristics, bottlenecks, success patterns, failure modes
- Explicit guidance for transitions

### 5. Personal Ontology as Foundation
Not an afterthought but the **organizing principle**:
- Four subsystems: Identity, Context, Process, Intelligence
- Extracted from existing behavior, then formalized, then extended
- Enables true intelligence mediation of intent

## Critical Success Factors

### Do These Things

**1. Maintain the Personal Ontology**
- Update as you evolve
- Keep it current and accurate
- Reference it in interactions
- Use as foundation for all work

**2. Use Explicit Modes**
- Request mode switches when needed
- Let Claude announce current mode
- Stay oriented to where you are
- Complete modes before switching

**3. Apply Quality Heuristics**

## Evolution and Contribution

This system is designed to evolve. As you use it:

**Document what works** → Update IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE
**Discover new patterns** → Extend TAXONOMIES
**Find theoretical gaps** → Refine THEORETICAL_FOUNDATIONS
**Improve research methods** → Enhance RESEARCH_PROTOCOLS

The goal is not static perfection but **continuous improvement** toward the ideal of human-AI cognitive symbiosis.

## The Ultimate Vision

### Short-term (0-6 months)
- Effective copiloting for routine cognitive work
- 30-50% time savings on common tasks
- Maintained or improved quality
- Clear sense of what AI does well

### Medium-term (6-18 months)
