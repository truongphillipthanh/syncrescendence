I want to understand the entirety of Mathematics holistically, conceptually, and semantically through metacognitive epistemic cartography. As meticulously and comprehensively as possible, reify a rhetorical narrative of Mathematics from first principles, being sure to define all foundational terms, concepts, axioms, laws, etc. Optimize for recursive argumentative coherence, crystallized intellectual density, semantic precision with conceptual resonance, architectonic structural elegance, and execution that demonstrates rather than declares quality. Prioritize inevitable expression—where form and content achieve mutual necessity
