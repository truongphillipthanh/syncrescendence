## The Best AI Tools to Revolutionize Your Work

There are thousands of AI tools available today. In my work helping businesses utilize AI, I've tested almost all of them. While many aren't worth your time or money, a few amazing ones can save you dozens of hours weekly and even revolutionize how you work. Here are what I believe to be the best AI tools you can use, ranging from boosting **personal productivity** to building powerful **AI automations** and **transforming entire business operations**.

### Tools for Personal Productivity and Writing

**Whisper Flow**
This is a voice-to-text AI tool that works in any app where you need to type. Instead of using your keyboard, you simply hold down the Whisper hotkey, start talking, and it does the typing for you. Crucially, it doesn't just transcribe word-for-word; it uses AI to understand your intent and generates text with perfect grammar, punctuation, and a clear, logical flow. I use it for everything from writing emails and Slack messages to, most importantly, **prompting other AI tools**. I can ramble for a couple of minutes about what I want an AI to do, and Whisper spits out a clear, well-structured prompt.

**Eleven Labs**
Speaking of voice technology, Eleven Labs has basically perfected **voice cloning**. By uploading about 30 minutes of your audio, you can create an AI version of your voice that sounds exactly like you, capturing not only your voice but also your pauses, emphases, and unique quirks. People are using this to create entire video courses, automate customer calls, or make audiobooks without recording anything themselves.

**ChatGPT Voice Mode**
The voice mode in the ChatGPT mobile app has become my go-to companion for **brainstorming**. It allows for a full conversation rather than typing prompts and waiting for a response. You can talk through business strategies, get feedback on ideas, or work through problems while you're on the go. The "super hack" is to ask it to summarize everything you discussed in a well-structured document after a long back-and-forth conversation. This is incredibly handy for creating a perfect document you can share with your team for a new project plan.

**Claude Projects**
For writing, Claude is my secret weapon, specifically **Claude Projects**. Think of it like creating your own team of specialized AI copywriters. You create different projects for different types of writing—for example, one for LinkedIn posts, one for website tutorials, and another for YouTube scripts. You upload examples of your best work and give specific instructions, and now, every time you use that project, it writes exactly the way you want it to. For my YouTube script writing project, I uploaded the transcript from a two-hour YouTube script writing course, and now I just give it a video idea, and it writes the script following all those best practices. The copy sounds like me because it learned from my examples.

**Notion AI**
If you use Notion, you need to be using **Notion AI**. It's built right into the platform and actually understands your entire workspace. Hitting the space bar on any new line activates it. Whether you need meeting notes summarized, action items pulled out, or a proposal written, Notion AI knows your company's exact format because it can reference other pages. It can even search through connected Slack and Google Drive. The coolest part is **AI blocks**, which let you save and reuse frequent prompts across pages, ensuring your whole team can use the same AI command.

**Google NanoBanana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image)**
Google recently dropped what might be the best image editing AI ever: **NanoBanana**, also known as **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image**. You can completely change someone's outfit, put them in a different location, or blend multiple photos, and the subjects still look like themselves, without common AI artifacts. It's also fast, taking only one to two seconds per image. It's currently free to use in Gemini, with 100 edits per day.

### Tools for Building AI Automations

The real power of AI comes when you integrate it into your automated business processes.

#### Automation and Integration Platforms

**Zapier, Make, and n8n** are the traditional automation platforms that have become excellent for building AI automations and agents.
* **Zapier** is the most beginner-friendly, allowing you to drag-and-drop connections between thousands of apps and AI. For example, an AI can analyze a customer email, update your CRM, and create follow-up tasks—all automatically.
* **Make.com** is for more complex tasks but is still beginner-friendly. It allows you to see exactly how your data flows through the automation, and the new Make Grid feature provides a visual map of how all your company's systems and automations connect.
* **n8n** offers the most flexibility for tech-savvy users with its open-source approach. You can create sophisticated AI agent workflows and self-host for complete data control.

**Relay.app and Gumloop** are new integration platforms designed specifically with AI in mind, making it simple for beginners to start building their first AI automations. Both founders, Jacob from Relay and Max from Gum Loop, constantly share valuable, working use cases and templates for AI automation.

#### Automation Utility Tools

**Anthropic Prompt Generator**
When using AI in automations, nailing your prompts is crucial. I use the Anthropic Prompt Generator so I never have to write a prompt from scratch. You give it a high-level, one- or two-sentence description of your goal, and it converts it into a prompt that follows all best practices. It adds proper formatting, includes placeholders for variables, and structures the output so that you can use the AI's results in other automation steps.

**Firecrawl**
For AI automations and agents, it's super useful to give AI the ability to search and read websites. **Firecrawl** makes any website readable for AI by taking messy web pages and turning them into clean data that AI can understand. It handles annoying elements like cookie banners and JavaScript for single pages, entire websites, or search results, and you can specify exactly what information to extract and how to format it.

#### Dedicated AI Agent Builders

**Lindy.ai**
If you're less technical but want to build AI agents, start with **Lindy**. The new Lindy 3.0 agent builder lets you describe what you want in plain English, and it builds the whole agent in minutes. It features a "computer mode" where your agent can click through websites and apps like a human, plus built-in meeting recording so agents can join your meetings.

**Relevance AI**
**Relevance AI** lets you build seriously powerful custom AI agents, but you're also creating the tools the agent uses. Their new **Workforce** feature lets you build entire teams or swarms of AI agents that work together. For example, one agent finds leads, passes them to another for research, and then to a third that writes personalized messages. They offer LinkedIn automation and website scraping, giving your agents the ability to do nearly everything a human can do in a browser.

**Google AI Studio**
This is your free playground for all of Gemini's features. The real magic is in the "Build" section, where you literally type what kind of app you want, and it creates a full, functional AI web application with interfaces and logic. You can describe a document analyzer or a recipe generator based on fridge photos and have a working app in seconds. All Gemini APIs are built-in, so you can test every Gemini model and setting without an API key or billing.

**Airtop**
**Airtop** lets you build powerful **browser agents** to automate the web using only your words. This is especially useful for interacting with tools that don't have an API. You tell your browser agent what to do in plain English—like "go through this directory and grab all the contact info"—and it will navigate through hundreds of pages, handle the login, and compile everything into a spreadsheet without any coding.

**Zite**
**Zite** is a no-code tool for creating real business apps. The AI helps design your layout, suggests improvements, and can generate complete interfaces based on your data and descriptions. It's great for client portals, dashboards, and data collection apps, and it connects and builds right on top of existing tools like Google Sheets and AirTable.

### Tools for Business Transformation

**Airtable AI**
Airtable has made AI simple for business workflows. You can create columns that automatically summarize and categorize data, or add AI steps to workflows to enrich leads or generate content in seconds. The killer feature is its ability to read PDFs and documents and automatically put the data into the correct columns. The new **Omni AI app builder** lets you describe what you want, and it builds the complete business app for you, including databases, interfaces, and automations.

**CircleBack**
In the AI era, recording your meetings is critical. **CircleBack** automatically transcribes meetings across Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, or even in-person conversations, and generates incredibly detailed notes organized by topic, with action items automatically assigned to participants. Its AI-powered search across all your meetings lets you ask questions like, "What did we decide about our product roadmap last month?" and it will find the exact moment and relevant context.

**Attio**
Every business needs a CRM, and **Attio** is an AI-native CRM built with AI in mind. You can deploy AI directly in the CRM, setting up research agents for complex tasks like prospecting and lead routing. It's fast to set up; you sync your email and calendar, and Attio populates your CRM and starts tracking everything. It also features built-in call intelligence for AI to automatically capture and store insights from your sales calls.

**Clay**
**Clay** is the go-to tool for scaling sales outreach and essentially invented the "GTM Engineer" job position. It functions like a spreadsheet on steroids for finding and enriching prospects. You import a list of companies or people, and Clay automatically enriches it with data from over a hundred different sources. The **Clay Agent** feature can visit any website and pull specific information you need, like finding a company's tech stack or checking if they are hiring for sales roles. You then use this research to write hyper-personalized outreach.

**Cassidy.ai**
**Cassidy.ai** lets you build specialized AI assistants that actually know your business, not generic chatbots. You can create a customer support bot that knows all your products or a sales assistant that understands your pipeline. The knowledge base syncs with all your tools so the AI always has the current information. Companies use this to automate RFP responses, support tickets, and competitive analysis.

**Super.work**
**Super** solves the problem of information scattered across Slack, Drive, Notion, and ten other apps. Super's AI searches everything at once; you just ask it what you need—like "what did we decide on pricing?"—and it finds it instantly across all your tools. The security ensures that each team member only gets answers based on what they actually have access to.

There is also one more amazing tool that has just come out recently: **ChatGPT Agent Mode**. There are so many ways to use it that it requires a separate in-depth look.
