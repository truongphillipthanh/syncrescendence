## Navigating Rapid Change: Four Pieces of Advice for the Creator-Entrepreneur

I'm going to share some of the things that I'm optimistic about, some of the things that concern me, and some advice that's been helpful to me as I've navigated the last two years as a **creator-entrepreneur**. We are in a world where models, platforms, and incentives change on a monthly basis, making it a challenge to tell stories and build technology. Historically, things have been very stable. Innovation happened at a palatable pace where you could keep up with it, or even stay ahead of it. But now, it is **damn near impossible** for anyone, including myself, to keep up with absolutely everything that's going on.

So, how do you prepare for this future today, and how do you stay sane in this time of rapid change? I have four pieces of advice I want to share with you.

### Advice \#1: Playtest Regularly

The first piece of advice is that you have to **jump off the deep end** and **playtest regularly**. There are so many things coming out on a damn near weekly basis—new models and new feature sets are dropping. You have to play with them to understand what they can do. You don't have to play with absolutely everything, but you must dive into the tools and workflows that are most relevant to your domain. Whether you're a designer, developer, creator, or a non-technical salesperson, it doesn't really matter—you have to dive into the tools that are at the forefront of impacting your own domains.

For me, that means playing with all the latest **perception AI, generative AI, and computer graphics tech**. It's also playing with all the **geospatial tech**. I do this on an absolute weekly basis, and I call it **play testing**. Find your own way of discovering what to playtest. That could be a YouTube channel like this one, a newsletter, or just a set of accounts you follow on X, LinkedIn, or Instagram. There are accounts out there that are curating the latest and greatest in the space of AI within your specific vertical.

### Advice \#2: Sandbox Mode vs. Architect Mode

As you play with the latest and greatest, there are two modes that you've got to actively switch between in order to not just play with a bunch of stuff, but to apply it, too. I call it **sandbox mode versus architect mode**.

#### Sandbox Mode

In sandbox mode, you're basically doing **undirected play testing** where you learn new capabilities. You're having fun, surrendering to serendipity, and open to happy accidents. I call it sandbox mode because you're building castles by the beach and are perfectly content with the waves coming and washing away everything you've built, because **we're not intending to ship anything**. If you do ship something from your playground testing, that's amazing, but it's not the goal. The goal is to get lost in a flow state, play around, experiment, and find those **nuggets of gold**—those happy accidents—that will unlock novel insights. It's in sandbox mode that you learn these new capabilities.

#### Architect Mode

Then, you switch into **architect mode** where you apply those newfound superpowers to a **concrete project**. This is where you set a deadline and have a deliverable, which could be a paid or personal project. Based on the new capabilities you've learned and the existing stuff you already know, come up with a discrete deliverable project. It could be an open-source GitHub repo, a new YouTube video, or an X thread breaking down something. The point is, you are in **execution mode**: building the skeleton, fleshing it out, and finally polishing and shipping the thing. That's where these untested capabilities meet production, and you unlock a new set of insights.

These insights will be super helpful because you're effectively learning how to take new capabilities and apply them to an existing workflow, and doing that over and over again as we get new primitives and capabilities to play with. In large companies, you'll typically see these functions split up between research scientists and production engineers. Researchers figure out the art of the possible and push the boundaries, but they don't worry about serving the product to millions or billions of users at scale. Another team worries about that. You have to apply that same thinking to whatever function you're in. There is an architect mode and a sandbox mode within all of these domains.

This is also how you keep things fun. When new things come out, you have to spark that **childlike wonder** inside of you that is excited about getting up in the morning and playing with these tools and capabilities.

Burnout often comes when you create a **treadmill of your own design**. It's an exhausting treadmill that you need to get on every single day, and it's not fulfilling because you're not seeing any new scenery. You're not sparking moments of joy, being surprised, or having moments of excitement, and that's because you're **not doing enough play**. When I talk to people who are burnt out, I usually find that they're just not doing enough undirected play testing in sandbox mode; they're far too much in architect mode. If you're constantly in the business of architecting a weekly review video, eventually all of the capabilities blur together, and you're doing something that is perhaps going to get automated very quickly anyway. One of the incentives of doing this type of undirected play testing is to come up with **novel insights** that at least AI systems and agentic AI systems aren't capable of doing today.

### Advice \#3: Build Your Island of Influence

Once you're in architect mode and you've built something cool with your new set of tricks and tools, you have to go share it with the world. This brings me to advice number three, which is **build an island of influence**.

**Building in public isn't cringe**. It's a damn near necessity. In this world where barriers to creation continue to shatter, a whole new set of voices will put their message out there on all sorts of modalities: text, Substack, blogs, podcasts, YouTube videos, X threads, whatever. This is already happening, and a whole new crop of creators comes up every time barriers get shattered like this, which means there's going to be a lot more competition. People who build their island of influence now, in this window of opportunity, are at an advantage.

Building an island of influence doesn't mean chasing hundreds of millions of followers. It might mean building a following of 3,000 people on LinkedIn, which might be all you need to make a dent in your professional goals, such as moving ahead in the visual effects industry. Or, it could be a Substack of 5,000 people in San Francisco if you only care about the coastal cities. The only island that you can truly own in this day and age is, quite frankly, a **newsletter**.

In summary, you've got to build some form of discovery, whether that's short-form platforms like TikTok and X, or long-form content like YouTube and podcasts. When you're starting out, you'll typically find that **shorter-form platforms are easier to get disproportionate attention** relative to your follower count. This is because most of these short-form platforms don't actually care how many followers you have. The 2,000-person account has just as much of a chance of its post going viral as the 2 million-person account, and that's really cool and important—it means you need to get as many at-bats out there as possible.

The main thing to figure out for your island of influence is what is a **sustainable way for you to create content**. You figure this out by authoring in the medium or modality that you are most comfortable in and where you produce your best work. For some, that involves sitting down and toiling over a script and then reading it out with a teleprompter. For others, like me, it's about coming up with a good outline and a few bullet points, and then riffing on it in a conversation like this. Find that modality that you do your best thinking and work in, and author in that.

Then, commit to **one piece of hub content**. That could be your weekly Substack, your weekly YouTube video, or three threads you put on X. That's your hub piece of content, and you'll derive everything else from it. This is the **hub and spoke model**. If that's your 30-minute YouTube video or Substack, you can derive a bunch of supplementary tweets to build that top-of-funnel attention from that hub piece of content. This is a very simple and popular framework that's been around forever.

This is important because it's only going to get easier to create content. You need to start building that audience of folks that matter to you and engaging with content that is clutch. In the future, you're going to be in a place with a **tsunami of generative content** where every brand and every startup can pick the perfect combination of Marques Brownlee meets Cleo Abram, tailored to their brand. This is the "puppet creator"—the white-label creator for that brand. You're absolutely going to see this happen.

### Advice \#4: Why 'Classical' Tools Are Your Moat

The last piece of advice is that **learning classical tools is key**. You have to learn the incumbent tools in your space. I was at a Harvard XR event, and a bunch of Ivy League master students in deep fields were asking me questions like, "Should I learn Unreal Engine, or should I still develop my Blender skills?". The answer is yes, of course, you should. People are overestimating how much of a disruption some of these technologies are and underestimating how central of a role these incumbent tools will continue to play for the time to come.

For example, if you're in the AI video space, it's amazing if you can create amazing things on Runway and other platforms—it's fun, and maybe you can even create a bunch of viral tweets. But the moment you want to create anything narrative, you need to learn a **nonlinear editor**. You can debate whether the nonlinear editor you learn is Adobe Premiere versus DaVinci Resolve or newer crop of tools like CapCut or Descript. For these kind of conversational videos, I find Descript really fun and intuitive because it lets me get into a flow state. I literally open the application, hit record, and then I can go edit it like it's a document. Similarly, you need to learn **compositing, image-based compositing**. I don't care whether you do that in Photoshop, Canva, or Procreate. And then, of course, you need to learn **video compositing** so you need to learn tools like After Effects. You've got to learn how you can take multiple plates of videos, other elements, and 3D elements, and composite all of that together seamlessly. This is a very important skill to learn because, for now, that is the bailing wire and duct tape you need to ship stuff—applying all these superpowers to a concrete project that actually makes a difference in the world.

It's also the thing that AIs will be able to do for you. For example, **MCP servers** are exciting, giving LLMs the ability to interface with all these other tools and use them. You can have Claude use Blender for you. But does it help to know what Blender can and can't do and how to go about doing it to command the LLM to do it for you? Absolutely, it does.

In other words, **if you're good at prompting humans, you'll be good at prompting machines in the future**. But the only way you're good at prompting humans or yourself to do something is by doing it, which means learning classical tools is key. As these things get more and more automated, it will be akin to that person sitting on the computer using it for you, and you're the **creative director** or the **conductor of the orchestra** asking for things to be done a certain way. Particularly on the 3D side, where AI is nascent, the way you bring it all together is in a 3D-first tool, which means something like **Blender, Unreal Engine, and ideally both**.

As you learn these classical tools, think of how much of an advantage you have than at any time in history. Not only do you have **YouTube University**—a plethora of video content and unlimited courses—but you can also ask AI to help you out. All of those videos have been digested into an amazing model like Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0, and you can ask it to give you advice in context to what you're doing on the screen. Learning becomes so much faster because you can find that tutorial on YouTube or ask AI to help you accomplish the exact thing that you want to do.

### The One Thing You Absolutely CAN'T Do

Look, I get it; this can all feel just a little bit overwhelming and exhausting. We seemingly get a new LEGO primitive every couple of weeks. But even the existing primitives have not been put together in the most obvious combinations, let alone all the non-obvious insights that you'll uncover as you put these capabilities to work against your own creative and business problems.

If there's one last piece of advice that I'll leave you with, it's this: in this world of tremendous change, tremendous opportunity, and seemingly zero barriers to entry, the one thing that you can't do is **nothing**. **This is your moment to act**. Because in this new world, **the only limit is your imagination**.
