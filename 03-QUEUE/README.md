# 03-QUEUE: SYNTHESIS INBOX

## Purpose (Revised 2026-01-22)
This directory holds HIGH-SIGNAL artifacts awaiting CANON integration.

## What Belongs Here
- Qualified claim atoms from external sensing
- Synthesis documents ready for dissertation defense
- High-value artifacts awaiting Principal review

## What Does NOT Belong Here
- Raw transcripts (externalized to Google ecosystem)
- Un-metadata'd content (process first)
- Low-signal noise (filter before entry)

## Lifecycle
1. Artifact enters via external sensing pipeline or manual import
2. Principal reviews and qualifies
3. Artifact either:
   - Integrates into 01-CANON (defended)
   - Moves to 04-SOURCES (curated reference)
   - Archives to 05-ARCHIVE (short-term memory)

## Teleology
