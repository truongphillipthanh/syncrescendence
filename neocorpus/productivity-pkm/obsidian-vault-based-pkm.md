## Core Thesis
Obsidian has emerged as the dominant tool for serious knowledge workers because it satisfies a unique set of constraints: local-first plain-text storage (future-proof, git-trackable), a plugin ecosystem that extends without lock-in, and a vault architecture that treats notes as a codebase rather than a database. The critical insight across these sources is that Obsidian's power scales with the degree to which the user treats the vault as infrastructure rather than as a notebook. The four-level progression (09405) from journaling through production through synthesis to creative output mirrors the maturity curve of any infrastructure adoption.

## Key Frameworks

### 1. Vault-as-Codebase Paradigm (00031, 02766, 10723, 03826)
The Ars Contexta guide and its extraction atoms establish that an Obsidian vault, because it is a directory of markdown files, can be operated entirely from the command line. Claude Code can create notes, modify frontmatter, build indexes, and validate schemas without ever opening the Obsidian GUI. This reframes the vault from "app with files" to "repository with an optional viewer." The CLI thread (10723) extends this: anything achievable in the Obsidian interface is achievable from a terminal, which means agentic systems can operate on vaults natively. Git tracking becomes trivial because the vault IS the repo.

### 2. Four Cognitive Modes (09405)
Nick Milo's Obsidian Bases + Workspaces framework defines four levels of vault usage: Inner Guide (self-mapping, journaling), Producer (task execution, project tracking), Synthesizer (cross-domain idea combination), and Creative (output generation). The key claim is that switching between these modes with one click provides "cognitive context switching" — the vault reconfigures its visible surfaces to match the user's current mental mode. This is workspace-as-cognitive-scaffold.

### 3. Graph Traversal as Spreading Activation (03634)
The atom extracted from Ars Contexta's research draws an explicit analogy between wikilink traversal in note graphs and the brain's spreading activation when priming related concepts. Activation decays with distance from the starting node. This provides the cognitive science justification for why link-dense vaults outperform folder-hierarchical ones for creative synthesis: the graph structure mirrors associative memory.

### 4. Ecosystem Lock-In Resistance (10652)
The "Obsidian Just Won" argument centers on the combination of local-first storage, open plugin API, and markdown portability. Unlike Notion or Roam, Obsidian's data format IS the universal format. The user never has to export. This makes Obsidian the only tool where the switching cost is near-zero — which paradoxically increases loyalty because there is no anxiety about commitment.

## Synthesis
The convergence across these sources points to a single architectural principle: the most powerful PKM tool is the one that disappears into the filesystem. Obsidian succeeds not because of its features but because of its absence of lock-in, its CLI accessibility (enabling agentic operation), and its graph structure (enabling cognitive-science-aligned retrieval). The four-level progression (09405) maps cleanly onto the vault-as-codebase paradigm (00031): Level 1-2 are "using the app," Level 3-4 are "operating the infrastructure." The gap between Obsidian-as-notebook and Obsidian-as-codebase is the gap between casual and serious PKM.

The version-history limitation flagged by 03190 — Obsidian shows only current state, not edit evolution — is precisely what git tracking resolves. The vault-as-codebase paradigm does not just enhance Obsidian; it completes it.

## Obsolescence and Supersession

**"Notes live in the app" was superseded by "notes live in the filesystem, the app is a viewer."** The pre-Obsidian paradigm treated the note-taking application as the primary reality — Evernote, Notion, and similar tools stored notes in proprietary databases that required the application to access. This created lock-in (your notes exist only as long as the company does) and prevented automation (no programmatic access without the vendor's API). Obsidian's vault-as-codebase paradigm (00031.md, 02766.md) represents a supersession: the markdown files are the primary reality, the GUI is an optional viewer. The practical consequence documented in 03826.jsonl — "everything possible in Obsidian UI is also possible from CLI" — means the vault can be operated by AI agents natively, without any vendor API.

**"Switching cost justifies commitment" was inverted by near-zero portability.** The standard reasoning for PKM tool commitment was that high switching costs made learning the tool's full depth worthwhile — the switching cost made the investment rational. Obsidian's "Obsidian Just Won" argument (10652.md) inverts this: because the data format is universal markdown, the switching cost is near-zero. Paradoxically, low switching cost increases commitment — users are not anxious about being trapped, so they adopt more deeply. The supersession: lock-in was assumed to be a feature that justified investment. It was actually a risk that prevented full investment. Zero switching cost enables full commitment.

**"Database architecture" for notes was superseded by "filesystem architecture" for agent-operability.** Notion and similar database-style tools represented the 2018-2022 dominant paradigm: structured notes with properties, relations, and filtered views. When agentic operation became valuable (AI agents processing vaults), database architecture (proprietary, cloud-locked, requiring vendor API) became a liability. Filesystem architecture (local markdown files, git-trackable, CLI-accessible) is structurally superior for agent-native PKM. The 03190.jsonl limitation — Obsidian shows only current state, not edit history — is precisely resolved by git tracking, which the vault-as-codebase paradigm makes trivial. The supersession runs from "best organizational interface" to "best agent substrate."
