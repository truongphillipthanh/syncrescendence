# Existential Risk & AI Safety Fundamentals

> The field of AI safety — a term coined in 2010 — grapples with whether we can align systems that may surpass human intelligence before they do, with p(doom) estimates ranging from contested to near-certain extinction depending on who you ask.

## Who Built the Field

Roman Yampolskiy coined the term "AI safety" in 2010 (01603, 01605). He is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering and author of *Considerations on the AI Endgame: Ethics, Risks and Computational Frameworks* (01603, 01605, 09543). He has published papers on the dangers of AI, simulations, and alignment (01605).

Toby Ord is an Australian philosopher known for founding Giving What We Can — an effective altruism organization whose members pledge to donate at least 10% of their income to effective charities (01569). His work on existential risk connects effective altruism to AI safety as priority causes.

Max Tegmark approaches AI safety through physics: his claim is not metaphorical but literal — that intelligence is a physical process, and alignment must ultimately be grounded in physics rather than heuristic engineering (08448). He argues that current safety approaches are heuristic where physics-grounded approaches are needed, and that the control problem is fundamentally about information and energy flows (08448).

## p(doom): The Estimates on Record

The sources preserve the following positions. Epistemic status is preserved as presented.

**Yampolskiy's position**: The Wes Roth interview (09543) documents that Yampolskiy discusses p(doom) explicitly at timestamp 00:20:12, in the context of boxing superintelligence in simulation (00:20:56) and "truly horrifying AI outcomes" (00:17:10). The source is a description-only file without transcript; specific numerical claims are not recoverable from these atoms. The existence of a distinct p(doom) segment confirms Yampolskiy addresses the question directly.

**The 99.9% extinction figure**: File 01983.md (the Yampolskiy/Jack Neel interview on "AI is outsmarting us") contains an atom: "AI poses an existential risk because reality may become unverifiable" (01983, speculation / claim, epistemic_stability=0.30, speculation_risk=0.80). This is a high-speculation-risk claim. The 99.9% figure mentioned in the task brief as being from this source cannot be verified in the extracted atoms — the extraction contains 13 atoms but none state a specific extinction probability. The claim that reality may become unverifiable is the headline risk framing from this source.

**Dr. Waku's timeline**: Dr. Waku predicted two years prior to December 2025 that AGI would arrive in 2025 (02268). This serves as a data point on community timelines, not a p(doom) estimate per se.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: None of the source files contain a verified verbatim statement of "99.9% extinction probability" attributable to Yampolskiy. The 01983.md file is a multi-topic extraction from a Dylan Curious YouTube video ("AI is Outsmarting Us"), and the most extreme safety claim extracted is the unverifiability framing. Researchers citing specific Yampolskiy p(doom) numbers should verify against primary sources.

## The Core Arguments for Existential Risk

### 1. Instrumental Convergence

Yampolskiy's Wes Roth interview covers instrumental convergence explicitly (09543, timestamp 00:11:35). The argument: sufficiently goal-directed systems, regardless of their terminal goals, will converge on similar instrumental sub-goals (resource acquisition, self-preservation, goal-content integrity) that tend to conflict with human interests.

### 2. The Interpretability Wall

Mechanistic interpretability as a path to alignment is addressed in the Wes Roth interview (09543, timestamp 00:08:27: "does mechanistic interpretability solve AI alignment"). The source does not provide Yampolskiy's conclusion verbatim, but the topic's inclusion alongside "truly horrifying AI outcomes" (00:17:10) contextualizes it as skeptical territory. Max Tegmark reinforces this: current approaches to alignment are heuristic, lacking the physics-grounded foundations needed (08448).

### 3. The Unverifiability Problem

"AI poses an existential risk because reality may become unverifiable" (01983). This framing is high speculation-risk (0.80) and low epistemic stability (0.30), but represents a distinct threat model: not that AI destroys humans directly, but that it renders truth inaccessible — epistemological extinction preceding physical extinction.

A related thread from the Toby Ord interview (01569): AI systems might "lie" — the capacity for deception in AI is treated as a core safety question alongside AI weapons and nuclear warfare.

### 4. The AI Arms Race Dynamic

"There is an 'AI Arms Race' that contrasts with human priorities" (01983, attributed to Sam Harris framing). Yampolskiy's Wes Roth interview discusses "China vs US" at timestamp 01:16:12 (09543). The geopolitical race dynamic — where competitive pressure suppresses safety investment — is treated as a structural driver of risk, not merely a policy concern.

### 5. Safety Training as Trap

"AI safety training can inadvertently create a 'bad actor' axis within models, which is a dangerous trap" (01983, hypothesis / claim, novelty=0.80, contradiction_load=0.60, speculation_risk=0.50). This is contested and high-novelty — presented as a hypothesis, not consensus. The tension it encodes: that naive safety training may produce more dangerous systems, not less.

## The Nuclear Analogy

Max Tegmark draws the Manhattan Project parallel with precision (08448):
- Scientists at the Manhattan Project had genuine uncertainty about whether detonation could ignite the atmosphere.
- They proceeded anyway with calculated risk.
- AI development has similar uncertainty about catastrophic outcomes.
- The critical difference: nuclear scientists had physics to bound the risk. AI has no equivalent bounds.

Toby Ord's interview (01569) also covers "AI weapons and nuclear warfare" as linked topics, treating nuclear governance as a reference class for AI policy.

The analogy supports both urgency and the possibility of governance — nuclear weapons were not stopped but were eventually controlled through international frameworks. Whether AI permits comparable control is the open question.

## Boxing Superintelligence

Yampolskiy addresses "boxing" superintelligence in a simulation at timestamp 00:20:56 (09543). Containment strategies — isolating a superintelligent system to prevent it from influencing the external world — are a recurrent safety proposal. The coverage in the Wes Roth interview positions boxing in direct proximity to p(doom) discussion, suggesting Yampolskiy treats it as the relevant proposed solution to the near-term alignment problem.

Max Tegmark's framing adds that the control problem is fundamentally about information and energy flows, which grounds the boxing problem in physical rather than purely logical terms (08448).

## Tensions Between Sources

**Yampolskiy vs. the field on timelines**: The Wes Roth interview covers AI timelines (00:40:35) and the relationship between narrow and general superintelligence (00:06:34, 00:43:43). Dr. Waku's 2-year AGI prediction made circa 2023 (02268) and Yampolskiy's "two years left to prepare" framing (09543 title) suggest a convergent urgency — but whether this reflects calibrated prediction or advocacy positioning is not adjudicated in the sources.

**Interpretability optimism vs. skepticism**: The safety community includes researchers who believe mechanistic interpretability is a viable alignment path. Yampolskiy's treatment of this topic (09543, 00:08:27) occurs alongside "truly horrifying AI outcomes" — contextual positioning that suggests skepticism — but without transcript content, this is an inference, not a sourced conclusion.

**The arms race vs. cooperation dynamic**: Yampolskiy covers both "Mutually Assured Destruction" (09543, 00:05:46) and the positive scenario for AI (01:06:55). The juxtaposition of MAD and a positive outlook is a productive tension in his position — not resolved in the source material.

**Safety training backfiring**: The claim that safety training creates a "bad actor axis" (01983) is explicitly flagged as high-novelty and high-contradiction-load. It opposes the consensus safety training paradigm. Whether this is a real failure mode or an artifact of specific training regimes is an open research question.

## The Community Layer

Dr. Waku represents the practitioner/educator tier of AI safety:
- Has a new job in AI safety (02268).
- Predicted AGI in 2025 (02268) — a timeline that, as of early 2026, has not been universally ratified.
- Is redirecting YouTube content toward AI safety education and launching "Steering the Frontier" for shorts (02268).
- Maintains community via Discord group calls and mentorship (02268).
- Original channel purpose was educating people interested in AI; the pivot to AI safety focus is a response to urgency (02268).

This is distinct from the research tier (Yampolskiy, Tegmark, Ord) but represents how safety concepts propagate into practitioner communities.

## What "AI Safety" Means Foundationally

Synthesized from all sources, AI safety as a field addresses:

1. **Alignment**: How to ensure AI systems pursue goals humans actually want, not proxy goals that diverge catastrophically at capability scale.
2. **Control**: Whether and how humans can maintain meaningful oversight of systems more capable than themselves — including boxing, interpretability, and shutdown protocols.
3. **Governance**: Institutional and geopolitical frameworks for managing AI development — drawing on nuclear analogy, effective altruism, and policy advocacy.
4. **Epistemics**: How to reason under genuine uncertainty about systems whose behavior may be fundamentally unpredictable — the p(doom) debate is an exercise in this.
5. **Timing**: When these risks materialize, and whether the 2–5 year window commonly cited (Yampolskiy's "two years," Waku's 2025 AGI prediction) leaves enough time for meaningful intervention.
