## AI as Civilizational Infrastructure

AI has crossed a tipping point, fundamentally reshaping geopolitics, economics, warfare, and the human experience. Three competing perspectives on AI's future: (1) extinction/superintelligence threat — AGI poses extinction-level risk; (2) total abundance — an era solving humanity's problems; (3) marketing hype — current enthusiasm is overblown. These frames coexist and compete for policy influence.

Andrew Ng profiles as an AI leader discussing LLMs as geopolitical weapons. Henry Farrell's research maps internet politics and transatlantic data governance. The AI national security nexus is not theoretical — it is the operational frame through which great powers now make strategic decisions.

## The Experience Curve Replaces Moore's Law

Alex Wissner-Gross's claim: Moore's Law is no longer applicable to AI's progression. AI now follows an experience curve — solving problems in bulk across diverse fields (mathematics, science, engineering, medicine). The future will see intelligence become cheap, abundant, and ubiquitous, leading to changes from humanoid robots to planetary-scale infrastructure. The cost trajectory of AI is decoupling from semiconductor physics and entering a data/training volume regime.

## US AI Leadership: GENESIS and Beyond

The USA Genesis Mission is a federal AI science initiative. Amazon committed $50 billion in AWS expansion for AI infrastructure. Trump's "One Rule Book" for AI regulation seeks federal preemption of state AI laws, DOJ empowerment to litigate AI matters, and Commerce Department funding linked to AI regulation compliance. David Sacks debates federal preemption versus state-level control, with implications for open-source innovation.

NVIDIA H200 exports approved — reshaping global chip strategy. But export controls are fragmenting the AI supply chain while pushing rivals to develop independent capability. The semiconductor chokepoint is simultaneously America's greatest leverage and its greatest vulnerability: effective in the short term, it incentivizes competitors to build alternative supply chains.

## India's Emergence

India is experiencing its "decade" of significant rise and influence. Manoj Ladwa and the India Global Forum are positioning India as a key actor in the multipolar world order. India's fastest-growing economy status and demographic dividend contrast with aging competitors (China, Japan, Europe). India is the demographic counterweight in a world of shrinking workforces.

## Surveillance, Deepfakes, and Democratic Risk

Palantir's ELITE tool for ICE identifies neighborhoods for enforcement raids — AI integrated into law enforcement at the community scale. AI influencers are creating deepfake content of celebrities. Comic-Con banned AI art following artist pushback — cultural backlash is emerging alongside adoption.

The Davos finding that 50+ NeurIPS 2025 papers contain AI hallucinations raises a structural question: if the research layer itself is unreliable, what happens when policy is built on its conclusions? The AI-national security nexus rests on assumptions about AI capability that may themselves be hallucinated.

## The Intelligence Tools Revolution

OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) has democratized intelligence gathering. Citizen-accessible tools: ADS-B Exchange (flight tracking), MarineTraffic (maritime), Sentinel satellite imagery, Google Earth Pro, LiveUAMap (conflict mapping), Broadcastify (radio scanning), Maltego (network analysis). The implication: state intelligence monopolies are dissolving. Citizen networks can now track military movements, infrastructure disruptions, and geopolitical events in real time. This changes the information asymmetry that has historically favored state actors.
