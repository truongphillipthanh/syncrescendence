## The Silicon Valley-Pentagon Rapprochement

Palmer Luckey's trajectory — from Oculus VR founder to Facebook acquisition to firing over political donations to CEO of Anduril (state-of-the-art autonomous weapons for the US military) — signifies Silicon Valley's shift from 15 years of defense sector hostility. The Google Pentagon AI contract revolt is over. COVID-19 and the Ukraine War exposed critical manufacturing deficiencies and speed-of-warfare vulnerabilities that legacy defense contractors (operating on "Soviet-style five-year plans" with cost overruns and obsolescence) cannot address.

The "Harvard dorm room generation" now recognizes satellite and drone builders as essential. Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen frame this as the beginning of a "Second American Century" — renewed US leadership in defense, energy, mining, and manufacturing driven by entrepreneurial founders pivoting from consumer tech to hard infrastructure.

## GenAI.mil and the Commercial-First Pentagon

Emil Michael — former Uber global business lead, now Chief Technology Officer and Under Secretary of War for Research & Engineering — is executing what he calls a "generational opportunity to transform culture and pace of innovation inside the Pentagon."

**GenAI.mil**: Google's Gemini and xAI's Grok deployed to the entire US military force (~3 million people). Achieved 1+ million unique users in the first 30 days. The Pentagon is moving to a "commercial first" approach — adopting startup-velocity commercial AI rather than building bespoke defense systems.

**Critical Technologies**: Emil Michael reduced the Pentagon's priority list from 14 areas to 6: hypersonics, direct energy weapons, autonomous drone swarms, and three others. The focus is on technologies where speed of deployment matters more than incremental improvement.

## AI Redefining Power

Palantir CEO Alex Karp at WEF 2026: AI is redefining power, war, and economies. AI stress-tests states, militaries, and markets. "AI exposes what societies can truly bear" — differential adoption equals differential power. Evidence: Ukraine war technology deployment, hospital AI adoption, boardroom implementation, economic indicators. Societies that fall behind in AI adoption face systemic disadvantage.

Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar's work on ICE's ELITE tool illustrates the domestic dimension: AI integrated into law enforcement for predictive surveillance at the neighborhood scale. The technology that enables military advantage also enables authoritarian enforcement.

## The Pentagon Prepares for AGI

A $900 billion defense bill includes a Pentagon directive to prepare for General Intelligence (GI). Specific mechanisms: a "futures steering committee" and human override protocols for super-intelligent systems, targeted for 2026. Speculation about Project Sun Catcher — solar-powered AI data centers in sun-synchronous orbit using space lasers for data transmission. Elon Musk's trajectory framed as a Type II civilization acceleration attempt on the Kardashev scale.

## Drones Reverse 150 Years of War Medicine

Since the US Civil War, improved war medicine steadily reduced fatality ratios — injured soldiers became more likely to survive each successive conflict. The Russia-Ukraine war has reversed this 150-year trend. Drones revolutionized the battlefield by degrading medical infrastructure and making medevac nearly impossible on contested frontlines. NATO is now seeking solutions to counter this drone-driven reversal. The implication: autonomous systems don't just change how wars are fought — they change who survives them.

## Jensen Huang's Framework

NVIDIA CEO at CSIS: AI infrastructure is central to both national security and economic competitiveness. The prescription: accelerate US AI innovation, build AI infrastructure via public-private partnerships, strengthen national security through allied collaboration. The datacenter is now national infrastructure — and datacenter policy and rising electricity costs are driving 2026 campaign fights over affordability and prompting presidential pressure on Big Tech to cover local utility impacts.

Microsoft's five-part community response: pay local utility equivalents, cut water use, create jobs, increase tax revenue, fund AI training and nonprofits. The hyperscaler era is now a political issue.
