## The WEF Model: Public-Private Coordination

The 56th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum (January 2026) focused on trust, transparency, consistency, and accountability. Attendance: over 100 governments, all major international organizations, 1,000 Forum Partners, civil society leaders, experts, youth, social entrepreneurs, and news outlets. WEF defines itself as the "International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation" — engaging political, business, cultural, and societal figures to shape agendas. The explicit function: a trust/coordination forum for global elites to align on AI, economics, and geopolitics.

The WEF initiated what observers called an "AI turf war" at Davos 2026. The AGI timeline debate crystallized there — Demis Hassabis versus Dario Amodei perspectives on safety versus capability. The institutional layer of AI governance is now as contested as the technical layer.

## JPMorgan and Financial Power

Jamie Dimon's framework: NATO weakness, European vulnerability, Chinese strategic patience, and the risk of transactional US foreign policy. AI will eliminate jobs, reshape banking, and force government intervention. The financial sector is not a spectator — it is a direct participant in geopolitical power dynamics, with $10+ trillion in assets under management by the largest institutions flowing through AI-mediated decisions.

## The Balanced Budget Movement

Chris Sununu — MIT-educated engineer, four-term New Hampshire governor — now chairs Balanced Budget Now. Critical number: 27 of 34 states required for a constitutional convention have been secured. Nearly all states (including California) have balanced budget requirements at the state level. The prediction: proximity to triggering a convention of states will pressure Congress toward a traditional amendment route. This represents a structural governance reform movement operating below the national media radar.

## Decentralized Media and Reputation Economics

The media ecosystem shift: decentralized speech environments versus centralized gatekeeping. Substack as a creator-led platform is eroding legacy media's information monopoly. Investment framework for the AI era: supply-driven markets, technological step changes, and reputation-driven platforms. AI as universal problem solver makes reputation the core competitive advantage — intangibles matter more than ever.

## The Governance Legitimacy Crisis

Multiple converging pressures on institutional governance: AI regulation federalism (federal versus state control), datacenter electricity costs as political issue, semiconductor export controls as industrial policy, balanced budget constitutional pressure, alliance predictability crisis, and research reliability questions (NeurIPS hallucinations). The institutions that governed the post-WWII order — NATO, WEF, IMF, the US constitutional framework itself — are simultaneously being stress-tested by AI disruption, demographic decline, and great power competition.

The question is not whether institutions will adapt but whether they will adapt fast enough. The lag between technological capability and institutional response is the primary risk vector for governance failure.
