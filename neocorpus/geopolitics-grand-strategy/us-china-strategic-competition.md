## The Engineering State vs. the Lawyerly State

Dan Wang's framework: China is an **engineering state** — its national model produces tangible goods ("widgets"). America is a **lawyerly state** — its national model produces financial instruments and services ("dollars"). Both are engaged in "humiliating self-sabotage." The only force capable of defeating the USA is the USA itself. China possesses "amazing capability to produce widgets" while the US manufacturing base is susceptible to de-industrialization.

This is the structural asymmetry. China dominates the physical world — manufacturing, infrastructure, material production. The West dominates the digital and financial world — networks, platforms, capital flows. David Friedberg's framing: "The Internet is rising over the state in the West" while "China is increasingly dominating the physical world." This is not a temporary imbalance. It is a dual hegemony with each power controlling a different substrate of civilization.

## The Insularity Thesis

Self-driving cars, humanoid robots, drones, and AI are massive national security threats. The US is unlikely to accept AI-powered drones and autonomous vehicles manufactured in China operating domestically. Each superpower will become more insular, focused on domestic manufacturing and supply chains.

Tesla-SpaceX merger speculation illustrates the pattern: CFIUS review blocks multinational defense contractor mergers. Tesla's Giga Shanghai creates a national security risk if merged with SpaceX (which holds government contracts). Solution: separate Tesla International from Tesla US, then merge the US entity with SpaceX. The 50-100 year vision: Tesla provides infrastructure for the next century of AI, energy, robotics, and transportation.

## Deglobalization and the Energy Axis

Peter Zeihan's predictions: the next decade will be shaped significantly by energy — affecting globalization, warfare, and AI. China is expected to decline within the next 10 years. The world is entering a labor shortage for which no one is prepared. Future wars will primarily be over energy resources. Shrinking workforces will alter geopolitics. America's readiness for a deglobalized world is the key question.

The structural shifts: labor shortages alter geopolitics, energy dominates over globalization, future conflicts center on resource access, and American manufacturing readiness determines survival in a deglobalized order.

## China's AI Strategy

China pursues the opposite strategy to Western AI labs on model weights. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google develop closed-weight proprietary models. Chinese labs pursue open-source, open-weight models — creating more distributed advantage globally. The paradox: the US security mindset (closed = controlled) gives China open-source dominance on the global stage.

DeepSeek's reasoning model surge and rapid releases from Chinese labs (Moonshot's Kimi K2.5, ByteDance's SeedDance 2.0) are closing the performance gap with Western labs. China is also considering massive subsidies and pursuing semiconductor independence in response to US export controls.

## American Stagnation and Renewal

Marc Andreessen frames the American Dream's stagnation through a cost crisis in housing, education, and healthcare — solvable through technology and deregulation. Chris Sununu's Balanced Budget Now movement has secured 27 of 34 states required for a constitutional convention. His prediction: plumbers and welders will be more valuable than "elite" white-collar workers in the AI era; fewer lawyers would be beneficial.

The network state and freedom cities concepts represent exit strategies: startup societies under construction, deregulation as enabler for reindustrialization, the drive for new American Freedom Cities as alternatives to institutional decay.
