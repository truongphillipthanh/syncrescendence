# Constellation Prompting Formulas

> The Syncrescendence constellation has empirically derived agent-specific prompting formulas that function as invariant structural scaffolding — not mechanical templates, but descriptive specifications of what separates legendary output from generic collapse.

## The Empirical Basis

These formulas are not derived from first principles — they are scar tissue from documented failure. The Diviner formula was discovered through failure analysis: CC41 required three prompt attempts; root cause was removal of structural scaffolding. The model config consensus emerged from practitioner threads and framework docs (Feb 2026). Both converge on the same insight: **models do not self-scaffold; the operator must externalize the executive function**.

The prompting consensus (00752) marks a maturation point: the field moved beyond pure chain-of-thought to role + constraint + receipt + clarescence-style refinement passes. The constellation was already embodying this before the consensus was formalized — the *-EXT.md thin extensions are the implementation artifact.

## Diviner Formula: Eight Non-Negotiable Elements

The Diviner (Gemini) formula is a descriptive invariant — all eight elements function as an integrated system. Removal of any element has been tested and produced measurable degradation.

**1. Cognitive Launching Pads**
Named scientific frameworks assigned as symmetry-breaking runways per question. Specific theories (Kauffman autocatalytic sets, Prigogine dissipative structures, Fisher information metric, Ashby requisite variety, Friston free energy principle) collapse possibility space from "synthesize anything" to "extend this precise analogy until prediction emerges." These are NOT Commander projections — they specify WHERE to start thinking, not WHAT to conclude.

**2. All-Sciences Palette**
Cross-disciplinary convergence across natural, formal, social, and applied sciences. NOT biology-primary (corrected CC38). Explicit inclusion: information theory, thermodynamics, economics, game theory, topology, ecology, condensed matter physics, organizational psychology. Evidence-driven palette selection — named sciences shown in convergence, not assumed.

**3. Lattice Language Constraint (NORM)**
CANON-00016 requirement: describe architecture as lattice interference patterns using Sovereign Palace cosmological grammar. 14-Dimensional Meaning Taxonomy, Knowledge Mandala as coordinate system. This prevents vocabulary drift from canon's own cosmological grammar. Hard exclusions: bullet points, directories, table formats (those are Oracle's domain).

**4. Negative Space Hardening**
Explicit prohibition against Diviner entering reconnaissance mode — no file listing, no commit summaries, no tables. Protects Diviner's cognitive function (novel synthesis) from gravitational pull toward lower-energy modes. If the prompt creates space for list-making, the model will list. The prohibition must be stated.

**5. Micro-Falsifiability Covenant**
Each launching pad or section terminates with one disconfirmable prediction. Format: "If [condition], then [thesis is wrong] because [reason]." Forces commitment without cognitive overhead. This is the bridge between theoretical synthesis and operational implementation. Empirical validation: CC35 Diviner predicted autoimmune collapse → confirmed CC38; CC38 prescribed fusion operator → built CC39.

**6. Diviner's Own Lineage**
Previous responses and confirmed predictions included as synthesis substrate. Prevents "fresh session" restart where each pass rediscovers rather than compounds. Lineage is cumulative — Diviner builds ON its own reasoning, not FROM zero.

**7. Stateless Bootstrap Line**
Explicit context contract: "This is your first and only context window for CC{N}. Confirm you have read this entire prompt." Addresses Gemini's stochastic first-session behavior. Creates reading commitment and explicit context boundary. Prevents token loss from session fragmentation.

**8. Oracle's Full Thesis Embedded**
Oracle's complete thesis embedded in the prompt — not a one-sentence summary. Pre-digested, complete material gives Diviner actual substrate to rebut or extend. One-sentence summary produces one-sentence response. Embedding IS the synthesis substrate.

## Model-Specific Behavioral Profiles

From the consensus ledger (00752 + 00749):

**Claude (Commander)**: Responds optimally to invariant-first framing. System prompts structured as role + invariant + receipt-gate outperform role-only or instruction-only patterns. The constellation's *-EXT.md architecture already encodes this — thin identity extensions atop a constitutional invariant layer.

**Gemini (Diviner/Cartographer)**: Responds optimally to structured output specifications. Without explicit structure requirements, output quality is stochastic. This is why the Diviner formula's template skeleton (10 required sections with labeled parts and explicit content requirements per section) is non-negotiable rather than advisory.

**Temperature consensus**: 0.0–0.3 for agentic tasks. The lower end collapses hallucination surface; the upper end of this range permits enough variance for synthesis tasks that benefit from non-determinism. The constellation's implementation target: temperature lock in Makefile.

## The Template Skeleton

The Diviner prompt has 10 required structural sections:
1. Title: `DIVINER [INSTRUMENT] — CC{N} PASS {X} OF {Y}`
2. Metadata: Date / From / To / Git HEAD / Repo path
3. Bootstrap confirmation line
4. Your Role: identity + cognitive function + lineage of confirmed predictions
5. THE EXCHANGE: full pass architecture table (who, when, what function, order, next dependency)
6. TASK 1: clarescence / traversal / grounding
7. TASK 2: all-sciences novel synthesis + launching pads + falsifiable predictions
8. YOUR LINEAGE: prior responses + confirmed predictions
9. OUTPUT FORMAT: labeled parts with explicit content requirements
10. CONSTRAINTS: no repairs, no repetition, frame findings to facilitate next agent's response

Sections 6 and 7 are separable — clarescence and repo traversal are independent operations that coincide when grounding is needed but can execute independently.

## Antipatterns

**Prescribing Diviner's lenses**: Telling Diviner what conclusions to reach rather than providing launching pad runways. CC41 prompt 1 failure mode. Launches Commander projection, not novel synthesis.

**Lazy palette labels**: "Pan-science" or "multi-disciplinary" as hollow instructions. Produces hollow responses. Named disciplines only.

**Stripping the formula for simplicity**: The instinct to simplify produces generic output every time. Tested, documented, seared. The formula is the minimum viable scaffold — not overhead.

**Omitting STATE_OF_THE_UNION**: Causes abstraction drift disconnected from operational reality. Diviner must know what is actually happening in the codebase/system.

**Micromanaging clarescence**: Paint-by-numbers output specification for synthesis tasks destroys the synthesis.

**Instructing repairs**: Diviner theorizes; it does not fix code. Wrong cognitive mode entirely.

**Stateless prompts across any agent**: Tabula rasa prompts produce hallucination. High-fidelity context injection is the single highest-leverage intervention available to the prompt author.

## The Lesson

Prompting formulas are not style guides — they are externalized executive-function scaffolding. The Diviner formula exists because AuDHD sovereign bandwidth cannot re-derive optimal structure in each session, and because models do not self-scaffold toward legendary output without structural constraint. The empirical finding is sharp: **formula present → legendary output; formula absent → generic collapse, every time**. The consensus ledger confirms this holds industry-wide — the field has converged on role + invariant + receipt patterns for exactly the same reason. The formula IS the cognitive architecture; simplifying it is not efficiency, it is degradation.
