## 1. Terminal Workflow: Ghostty + Worktrees + Lazygit

Source 00103 describes a terminal developer workflow combination: Ghostty (Mitchell Hashimoto's terminal, tuned for DX), git worktrees (parallel branch checkouts), and Lazygit (TUI git client). The author considers this combination irreversible once adopted.

**The worktree limitation**: Git worktrees work well for simple frontend sites but break down for complex setups involving backend + database + frontend across multiple worktrees. Mitigations exist (containers or per-worktree bootstrapping), but at that point the isolation overhead approaches what containers provide natively, making the worktree advantage marginal.

The underlying tension: worktrees-as-isolation versus containers-as-isolation. Worktrees give you branch parallelism with shared git history. Containers give you full environment isolation with no shared state. For simple repos, worktrees win on speed. For complex multi-service repos, containers win on reliability.

## 2. AI Coding Tool Comparison: opencode vs Claude Code

Source 11032 provides an opinionated comparison of opencode (oc) and Claude Code (cc) as terminal AI coding agents.

**opencode advantages claimed:**
- Model agnostic — can use any model as new ones release, including free OSS models (Kimi 2.5, GLM 5, MM 2.5)
- Open source — community can fork and fix
- Keyboard-first TUI with configurable bindings and leader key support
- Can interact with the dialog while the agent runs (Claude Code cannot)
- /share feature for saving and sharing sessions
- Rewind and session management described as working "flawlessly" versus "broken" in Claude Code

**Claude Code advantages:**
- Deeper agentic features (plan mode) due to larger team and faster internal dogfooding
- Performance and agentic ability described as "on par — if not better" than opencode on newer features

**Technical architecture difference**: opencode uses `opentui` (in-house TUI library with Zig-based rendering engine). Claude Code uses `ink` — described by the source as "an objectively worse primitive" that Anthropic doesn't own.

**Specific Claude Code UX failures documented:**
- Cannot run commands while agent executes
- Trims command output in new sessions
- Cannot expand output with mouse
- Copying output produces weird spacing

This is the competitive landscape framing for AI coding tools: opencode as the challenger claiming UX and model-agnosticism; Claude Code as the incumbent claiming deeper agentic harness maturity.

## 3. Hardware Homelab: Three-Tier Equipment Progression

Sources 03496 and 08838 describe a tiered hardware homelab guide for robotics, embedded systems, IoT, and hardware startups.

**Core philosophy**: A hardware homelab is NOT a "maker setup." It is private infrastructure for learning, prototyping, testing, and shipping real systems.

**Purchasing principles:**
- Buy tools not toys
- Prefer general instruments over specialized ones
- Optimize for repairability, measurement, and iteration speed
- Grow with skill, not aesthetics
- Upgrade only when tools limit experiments, not out of boredom
- Every new tool should unlock a new class of problems
- If you cannot explain why you need it, do not buy it

**Tier 1 — Basic (Foundation Layer):**
Anti-static mat, surge protector, 60–80W temperature-controlled soldering iron, solder (lead + lead-free), flux, desoldering tools. Full-size breadboard, jumper wires, component kit (resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors). Digital multimeter (true RMS). 8–16 channel USB logic analyzer — "This is where embedded actually starts." Arduino-compatible board, ESP32 dev board, Raspberry Pi or equivalent SBC.

**Tier 2 — Intermediate (Systems Layer):**
Bench power supply (dual output, current limiting). Lithium battery charger/balancer and fire-resistant LiPo bag ("non-optional when using batteries"). DC motors + encoders, NEMA 17 stepper motors + drivers, servo motors, motor driver boards (BLDC, DC, stepper). Digital calipers, hand tools, open ecosystem 3D printer, PLA/PETG/ABS filament. IMU sensors (6-axis, 9-axis), depth/stereo camera, force/pressure sensors. USB-to-serial adapters, external SSD.

**Tier 3 — Advanced (Research & Product Layer):**
Digital oscilloscope (≥100 MHz), advanced logic/protocol analyzer, power analyzer/current probe. Hot air rework station, PCB assembly tools (stencils, paste, microscope), inspection microscope. Industrial-grade encoders, LiDAR sensor (2D or 3D), Jetson-class real-time compute. Metal cutting tools or mini CNC (optional). Network switch + router, rack/storage system.

Culminating claim: "This is not about comfort. It is about leverage. Build the lab. Then build systems. Then build products."

## 4. Cybersecurity Landscape 2026

Source 02164 identifies three defining cybersecurity trends for 2026:

1. **Shadow AI**: Unauthorized AI tool usage within organizations — employees using AI services that IT doesn't know about, creating unmanaged data exposure and compliance risk
2. **Polymorphic malware**: AI-generated malware that mutates its signature continuously, evading traditional pattern-matching detection
3. **Post-quantum cryptography**: The transition from current encryption standards to quantum-resistant algorithms, driven by the approaching viability of quantum computers capable of breaking RSA and ECC

These are trend labels from the source, not deep treatments. The common thread: AI and quantum computing are jointly redefining the security landscape, both as attack vectors and as defensive tools.

## 5. Singular Data Points

**Vertical farming energy premium** (source 01273): Vertically grown strawberries require 1,404 kWh of energy versus 0.45 kWh for conventionally grown strawberries in Chile — a 3,000x difference. This single number crystallizes the fundamental energy economics challenge of controlled environment agriculture. The epistemic status is high (consensus/evidence, epistemic_stability 0.80).

**System design fundamentals** (source 09370): A 1h 49m YouTube survey by Hayk Simonyan covering single server setup, SQL/NoSQL/Graph databases, vertical vs. horizontal scaling, load balancing, health checks, SPOF, API design and protocols, TCP/UDP, REST, GraphQL, authentication, authorization, and security. Description stub only — no transcript was extracted. Useful as a reference pointer but contains no original claims.
