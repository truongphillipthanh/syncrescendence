## 1. The Thesis

All large companies are already remote companies. The person on the first floor doesn't know the person on the third floor. When they collaborate, they message, call, and open shared documents. The only people truly working "in person" are the 10-15 within earshot. Past that number, every company is already remote — the office is just a building around a digital collaboration infrastructure.

Deel went from $1M to $100M ARR in 20 months — at the time, faster than Slack and any SaaS company in history. Crossed $1B revenue in six years. EBITDA-positive for three consecutive years. 7,500 employees across 110+ countries. No single office. The company grew fast not despite being remote but because of it.

## 2. Eight Reality Checks

### The talent pool is global, not geographic
The best engineers might be in San Francisco, but the assumption that they're *only* in San Francisco is a mistake. Exceptional people exist in São Paulo, Kraków, Bangalore, and thousands of other places who never had a reason to relocate. Remote hiring accesses this pool. The retention advantage: a great remote job paying significantly above the local average in a given country is hard to match. You're competing in a much less competitive marketplace.

### Visibility doesn't equal productivity
People who don't want to work will not work regardless of location. Locking them in an office from 9 to 5 doesn't change that — it makes it easier to fake productivity. "If I'm in office, I'm working" is the cover story. The moment you need to be behind someone for them to work is the moment they shouldn't be at your company.

### Nobody has six straight hours of creative output
The real workday is 9-11, break, 12-2, break, 3-6, break. In an office, breaks feel guilty. At home, you live your life between bursts — gym, nap, errand — and come back sharper. Remote lets people work when they're at peak focus instead of flattening their output into a 9-to-5 pattern.

### Offices are more distracting than homes
Shoulder-taps, coffee invitations, "just a second" interruptions. Managers get their time consumed all day by ambient demand. Deep work gets squeezed into whatever time remains. At home, everyone can isolate. Four focused hours at home can equal eight in the office.

### Employee-friendly doesn't mean employer-unfriendly
Letting people choose where they work gives them freedom. They work harder to keep the benefits. The first three months at Deel are purposely intense — sink-or-swim. People who can't keep up leave on their own. The culture self-selects.

### Commuting wastes 500,000 hours per year at 1,000 employees
Two hours per day, 250 working days, 1,000 employees. Even if workers don't use all recovered commute time for work, it's a net positive for both parties.

### Written communication beats verbal
Physical proximity leads to unrecorded verbal decisions. Written communication is clearer, creates accountability (there's a record), and forces precision. Remote companies write things down because they have to — and it's better for everyone.

### Structural cost advantage
No leases. Global hiring at local salaries. $5M in funding stretches further when there's no office overhead. Remote hiring is also a stronger equalizer — video interviews reduce bias from physical presence, disability, and proximity effects.

## 3. The Playbook

### Hire for Agency

Screen for: high agency, high intensity, self-discipline, desire to move fast, learning speed. Seven interview questions from Deel:

1. "If you could clone yourself as a 20-year-old, what career path would you send him along?" — Self-awareness, breadth, drive.
2. "Tell me one topic you went from zero to 'ready to teach' in less than six months." — Learning speed.
3. "What is California's state budget for healthcare? Walk me through how you'd estimate it." — First-principles thinking.
4. "Explain something you understand deeply that most people find boring or dumb." — Work ethic, discernment.
5. "Is there something you've changed your mind about in the past two years?" — Ego, ability to update.
6. "Have you ever wanted to do something, lacked the resources, and did it anyway?" — High agency.
7. "What is the best thing you've built that no one asked you to build?" — Intrinsic motivation.

Tell the truth about job intensity during the interview. Attracts people looking for a challenge, moves along those who aren't.

### The One-Month Impact Window

**Week 1**: Ramp. Tools training, meet 3 key people (manager, peer, adjacent-team contact), read internal knowledge base. No more than one week.

**Days 8-30**: Land a first visible win. The manager's #1 job is to help the new hire deliver a meaningful result in front of the team. An engineer ships a bug fix. A salesperson closes a deal. A marketer launches something the team shares. A new hire's effectiveness is directly proportional to how much the team believes they're capable. Early visible results create that belief.

**Daily 10-minute standup for 30 days**: Not a status update — a blocker removal session. "What are you working on? What's slowing you down? What do you need from me?" In an office, new hires absorb context passively through osmosis. Remotely, that doesn't happen. The daily check-in fills the gap. Taper off after 30 days.

### OKRs with Full Visibility

Every team and every person has OKRs. Performance is measured on delivery, not hours. Different metrics for different functions: sales on quota and pipeline quality, engineering on code shipped and speed, management on team results (not individual output). Full visibility — everyone can see where everyone stands. Miss OKRs for two quarters in a row, and you're usually out. A culture of doers gets built in consequence.

### No Cheerleader Managers

Every manager must also do the work. Pure managers — those who stopped being practitioners — lose the ability to judge performance. Their teams become average. Even managers of managers must have direct IC tasks. Managers are held accountable for their team's objectives before individual contributors are blamed for missed targets.

### Intentional In-Person Meetups

Remote doesn't mean people never meet. It means you're intentional about when and why. Deel runs: executive retreats (2x/year), director retreats (1x/year), SKOs for full GTM org, team offsites on request, travel budgets, quarterly city dinners, and exec drop-ins when leadership is in town. Meeting in person matters — so invest in it deliberately rather than incidentally.

## 4. The Operating Principle

Summarized: Hire people with agency who want to work hard, set them up to succeed in the first 30 days, hold everyone to visible OKRs, ensure managers stay practitioners, and bring people together deliberately.

The advice for skeptics: just try. Hire a few people globally. See how they do. Most people overthink remote and global hiring but have never actually tested it. There would be value in co-location with 10 people, but the cons outweigh the pros past that scale.
