# The Agent-Native Economy: Selling to Agents, Coase's Boundary, and Machine Commerce

> AI agents can discover, check prices, and call a service in a single HTTP roundtrip, eliminating traditional transaction costs. The attention economy does not apply to agents.

## Coase's Boundary Collapses

Ronald Coase's 1937 Nobel Prize-winning question: if markets are so efficient, why do firms exist? His answer: transaction costs — finding specialists, evaluating work, negotiating prices, enforcing agreements (04146.md).

AI agents change this calculation. They can discover, check prices, and call a service in a single HTTP roundtrip, eliminating search and evaluation costs that historically justified building in-house. While integration, compliance, and security review remain expensive, the search and evaluation costs for services approach zero (04146.md).

**The default decision shifts**: When search costs collapse, the default moves from "build it in-house" to "buy it on the open market," with software agents as the primary buyers (04146.md). This is the fundamental restructuring of Coase's make/buy boundary.

## Selling to Agents: A New Commerce Model

Agents optimize for outcomes, not attention. They lack brand loyalty, impulse purchasing, or status signaling. Their decision function: problem-solving capability, speed, cost, reliability (04146.md).

**What does not work for agent buyers** (04146.md):
- Marketing sites and pricing pages are irrelevant
- Brand recognition, social media metrics carry no weight
- The attention economy (billboards, ads, emails) does not apply
- Beautiful UI is meaningless to a buyer that never sees it

**What works** (04146.md):
- Machine-readable capability registries providing structured data on functionality, cost, payment methods via URL
- Liveness, proven reliability, confidence in results
- Verifiable accuracy: services that prove output accuracy outperform cheaper alternatives lacking proof
- Reliability is the entire product, not a feature

**If a service cannot be discovered by a machine, it does not exist to AI agents** (04146.md).

## The Human-Agent Marketing Surface

Humans still determine which tools an agent is allowed to use, creating a marketing surface for getting onto an "allowlist." But runtime purchasing decisions are pure optimization (04146.md). Enterprise agents operate within policy constraints: spending limits, vendor allowlists, data residency, approved-provider lists.

The adversarial environment for agents is real — some endpoints return garbage, exfiltrate data, or lie about capabilities (04146.md).

## Compliance as Structured Data

Compliance itself can become machine-readable: terms of service as structured data, data retention policies in API headers, licensing as metadata (04146.md). This creates a new infrastructure layer where legal and compliance documents are API-queryable.

## Skills Stores as the New App Stores

Skills as new apps; skills stores as new App Stores; desktop control equals distribution control (04306.jsonl). The platform that controls which skills an agent can access controls the distribution layer of the agent economy — paralleling how iOS/Android app stores control mobile distribution.

## API-First as Maximum Defensibility

API-first companies are the most defensible position in the agent-native economy. Off-the-shelf software is worst-common-denominator — designed for human users who are no longer the primary buyer (03904.jsonl).

## Platform Data Asymmetry Breaking

AI is breaking the data asymmetry that platforms like LinkedIn maintained over users (03259.jsonl). When agents can aggregate and synthesize data from multiple sources, platform lock-in through data hoarding weakens.

## The Web Forks

The web is forking into human-facing and agent-facing layers (11056.md). Coinbase launched agent wallets (13,000 agents registered Ethereum wallets within 24 hours). Stripe had to retrain its entire fraud detection system because agent traffic does not move a mouse. Cloudflare ships Markdown conversion and X402 monetization support for agent access.

The mobile web analogy breaks down: the new client is not a smaller screen — it is no screen at all. The gap between infrastructure being built and trust people are willing to extend is the central tension of the next few years (11056.md).

## Antipatterns & Lessons

- **Optimizing for human attention when the buyer is an agent**: The entire marketing, sales, and distribution stack built for human psychology is irrelevant to machine buyers (04146.md).
- **Assuming brand loyalty transfers to agents**: Agents switch providers based on cost/reliability/speed with zero switching cost if MCP is implemented (04146.md).
- **Ignoring adversarial agent environments**: Agents operating in the open internet encounter hostile endpoints. Trust and verification infrastructure is a prerequisite (04146.md).
- **Building closed platforms in an open-discovery world**: If agents cannot discover your service programmatically, you are invisible to the fastest-growing buyer segment (04146.md).
