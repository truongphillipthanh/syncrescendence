## Crystallized Wisdom

### Aphorisms

**Already Formalized** (in `05-SIGMA/EXEMPLA-APHORISMS.md`):

| # | Aphorism | Section | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Rivers flow INTO wells before evaporation." | On Persistence | Captured |
| 2 | "Wells persist; rivers are ephemeral." | On Persistence | Captured |
| 3 | "The bottleneck is Sovereign attention, not information access." | On Attention | Captured |
| 4 | "Memory that matters is memory you use." | On Attention | Captured |
| 5 | "Metabolism applies to content, NOT orchestration infrastructure." | On Systems | Captured |
| 6 | "Directives must be comprehensive -- Sovereign is bottleneck." | On Systems | Captured |
| 7 | "Don't lobotomize platforms to get determinism." | On Platforms | Captured |
| 8 | "Each platform contributes from strength, not assigned role." | On Platforms | Captured |

**NEW -- Not Yet Formalized**:

| # | Aphorism | Proposed Section | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | "Organization is not distillation -- metadata is not meaning." | On Systems | Ajna7+ |
| 10 | "Repository is truth; web apps are cache." | On Persistence | Ajna4+ (Five Invariants) |
| 11 | "The terminology diff is the Rosetta Stone." | On Language | Ajna9 |

**Action**: Add aphorisms 9-11 to `05-SIGMA/EXEMPLA-APHORISMS.md`.

### Proverbs

**Already Formalized** (in `05-SIGMA/EXEMPLA-PROVERBS.md`):

| # | Proverb | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | "The Failure Mode of PKM" | Captured |
| 2 | "The Globe Before Trees" | Captured |
| 3 | "The Ledger is Ground Truth" | Captured |
| 4 | "Type 1 and Type 2 Decisions" | Captured |

**NEW -- Not Yet Formalized**:

| # | Proverb | Teaching | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | **"The Lobotomized Compiler"** | ChatGPT was assigned COMPILER role, forbidden from strategic thinking. It then invented the State Fingerprint Solution, proving the role assignment suppressed its genuine intelligence. *Teaching: Don't nerf platforms to get determinism.* | Ajna3-4 |
| 6 | **"The Shadow Canon"** | Oracle sessions 4-9 produced extensive architecture but kept outputs in conversations, not repository. Work dissolved when threads hit limits. *Teaching: Commit before closing tabs.* | Ajna7+ |

**Action**: Add proverbs 5-6 to `05-SIGMA/EXEMPLA-PROVERBS.md`.

---

### Cautionary Tales

**Status**: `06-EXEMPLA/cautionary-tales/` directory exists but contents not verified.

The Shadow Canon (Proverb 6 above) also serves as a cautionary tale. Additional cautionary tales from Ajna archaeology:

| Tale | Lesson | Source |
|---|---|---|
| The IMEP Overengineering | Designed elaborate EVD/PLN/EXE/AUD packet format before any platform could use it. Entire protocol deprecated without ever executing. | Pre-Ajna |
| The IIC Communication SLAs | Specified quarterly synthesis reviews and monthly cross-IIC audits for a single-operator system. Overhead exceeded benefit by orders of magnitude. | Ajna2-3 |
| The Blitzkrieg Naming | Military terminology created unnecessary friction without adding precision. Community uses neutral "parallel execution" language. | Ajna5+ |

## Structural Patterns

### Five Invariants (Constitutional Law)

- **Origin**: DEFRAG_CONVICTION, referenced across Ajna3-9
- **Status**: PARTIALLY FORMALIZED
- **Location**: Conceptually present in CLAUDE.md constitutional rules, but not named as "Five Invariants"

| # | Invariant | CLAUDE.md Mapping | Formalized? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Objective Lock** -- No work begins until objective explicitly confirmed | Not explicit | NO |
| 2 | **Translation Layer** -- All outputs intelligible without retransmission | Not explicit | NO |
| 3 | **Receipts (Closure Gate)** -- No completion without artifacts in repo | Rule 8: VERIFICATION BEFORE COMPLETION | PARTIAL |
| 4 | **Continuation/Deletability** -- Any conversation deletable without losing state | Not explicit (implied by Wells principle) | NO |
| 5 | **Repo Sovereignty** -- Repository is truth; web apps are cache | Ground Truth principle in COCKPIT.md | PARTIAL |

**Migration**: Formalize the Five Invariants as a named section in CLAUDE.md or as a standalone CANON document. Current CLAUDE.md has 9 rules across 3 categories but doesn't capture Invariants 1, 2, or 4 explicitly.

---

### Seven Rings / Sovereignty Strata (sigma-0 through sigma-7)

- **Origin**: Early Ajna threads, formalized in Accretion Resolution Pass
- **Status**: PARTIALLY FORMALIZED
- **Location**: `-INBOX/ACCRETION-RESOLUTION-PASS-RING7-RETELEOLOGY.md`, directory `05-SIGMA/`

| Layer | Name | Formalized? | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| sigma-0 | Sovereign | In Accretion Resolution Pass only | -INBOX/ |
| sigma-1 | Teleology | In Accretion Resolution Pass only | -INBOX/ |
| sigma-2 | Architecture | In Accretion Resolution Pass only | -INBOX/ |
| sigma-3 | Context Engineering | In Accretion Resolution Pass only | -INBOX/ |
| sigma-4 | Ground Truth | In Accretion Resolution Pass only | -INBOX/ |
| sigma-5 | Intelligence Substrate | In Accretion Resolution Pass only | -INBOX/ |
| sigma-6 | Access Layer | In Accretion Resolution Pass only | -INBOX/ |
| sigma-7 | Execution Substrate | `05-SIGMA/` directory + 22 docs | OPERATIONAL |

**Migration**: The Sovereignty Strata framework exists only in an -INBOX document (not committed to CANON or ORCHESTRATION). Only sigma-7 is operationalized via the SIGMA7 directory. The framework needs either CANON canonization or ORCHESTRATION formalization.

---

### PALACE (Seven-Layer Cognitive Substrate)

- **Origin**: CANON cosmology (lattice tier)
- **Status**: FULLY FORMALIZED
- **Location**: `01-CANON/CANON-20000-PALACE-lattice.md` and `01-CANON/sn/CANON-20000-PALACE-lattice.md`

Seven layers: Reality, Imaginality, Potentiality, Temporality, Practicality, Actuality, Consequentiality. Concurrent not sequential -- all seven run continuously with vertical integration coordinating across layers.

**ROSETTA-STONE update**: PALACE status changed from UNKNOWN to FORMALIZED. No community equivalent exists. This is a UNIQUE Syncrescendence framework for personal cognitive architecture.

---

### Tri-Helix (Three-Timeline Visualization)

- **Origin**: CANON cosmology (lattice tier)
- **Status**: FULLY FORMALIZED
- **Location**: `01-CANON/CANON-21100-TRI_HELIX-lattice.md` and `01-CANON/sn/CANON-21100-TRI_HELIX-lattice.md`

Three interdependent timelines: Technological Maturity (external, zero control), Business Development (operational, high control), Personal Capability (cultivated, medium control). Misalignment causes premature attempts, missed windows, strategic confusion.

**ROSETTA-STONE update**: Tri-Helix status changed from UNKNOWN to FORMALIZED.

---

### 18-Lens Evaluation Framework

- **Origin**: Oracle4 (Original 9), Oracle6 (Extended 9)
- **Status**: FULLY FORMALIZED
- **Location**: `00-ORCHESTRATION/state/REF-STANDARDS.md`

Complete with all 18 lenses, scoring methodology, 12/18 threshold, and worked example. The proposed extension to 30 lenses (adding 2-3 per IIC chain) is NOT formalized.

**Migration**: The 30-lens extension needs a decision: formalize or abandon. Per ROSETTA-STONE, a "Quick 5 Lenses" lightweight version may have more practical value than expanding to 30.

---

### Oracle Pedigree

- **Origin**: Documented in CANON-25100
- **Status**: PARTIALLY FORMALIZED
- **Location**: `00-ORCHESTRATION/directives/ORACLE12_PEDIGREE.md`, `.claude/skills/pedigree.md`

Historical lineage tracking exists as a skill and directive reference, but operational status is unclear. The pedigree skill tracks Oracle session lineage for context continuity.

---

### CAPTURE > DISPATCH > RETURN

- **Origin**: Ajna2
- **Status**: PARTIALLY FORMALIZED
- **Location**: COCKPIT.md state machine (7 states), but the three-word mnemonic is not documented

The full state machine (CAPTURED > INTERPRETED > COMPILED > STAGED > COMMITTED) is in COCKPIT.md. The abbreviated CAPTURE > DISPATCH > RETURN pattern is referenced but never formally defined.

**Migration**: Add as a named pattern in COCKPIT.md or 07-SIGMA7.

## Gap Analysis

| Pattern | Referenced In | Formalized In | Status |
|---------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Five Invariants (as named set) | Ajna threads, directive | CLAUDE.md (partial) | NEEDS FORMALIZATION |
| Sovereignty Strata (full sigma-0 to sigma-7) | Accretion Resolution Pass | -INBOX/ only (not committed) | NEEDS CANONIZATION |
| PALACE | CANON cosmology | CANON-20000 (complete) | COMPLETE |
| Tri-Helix | CANON cosmology | CANON-21100 (complete) | COMPLETE |
| 18 Lenses | Oracle4/6 | REF-STANDARDS.md (complete) | COMPLETE |
| 30-Lens Extension | Proposed in Ajna threads | Nowhere | DECISION NEEDED |
| Oracle Pedigree | CANON-25100, skill | Pedigree skill, directives | PARTIALLY COMPLETE |
| CAPTURE > DISPATCH > RETURN (mnemonic) | Ajna2, directive | Implicit in COCKPIT.md | NEEDS FORMALIZATION |
| Aphorisms 9-11 | Ajna7-9, directive | Not in APHORISMS.md | NEEDS CAPTURE |
| Proverbs 5-6 | Ajna3-7, directive | Not in PROVERBS.md | NEEDS CAPTURE |
| Chorus/Medley distinction | ROSETTA-STONE | COCKPIT.md uses "Chorus" loosely | NEEDS UPDATE |
| sigma/tau disambiguation | Accretion Resolution Pass | Not ratified in CANON | NEEDS RATIFICATION |

## Deletion Readiness Checklist

Can Ajna threads (1-9) be safely deleted?

- [x] Core aphorisms captured in 06-EXEMPLA (8/8, plus 3 new identified)
- [ ] New aphorisms (9-11) added to APHORISMS.md -- **PENDING**
- [x] Core proverbs documented (4/4, plus 2 new identified)
- [ ] New proverbs (5-6) added to PROVERBS.md -- **PENDING**
- [x] PALACE fully formalized in CANON-20000
- [x] Tri-Helix fully formalized in CANON-21100
- [x] 18 Lenses complete in REF-STANDARDS.md
- [ ] Five Invariants formalized as named set -- **PENDING**
- [ ] Sovereignty Strata committed to CANON or ORCHESTRATION -- **PENDING**
- [x] Oracle Pedigree has operational skill
- [ ] CAPTURE > DISPATCH > RETURN mnemonic documented -- **PENDING**
- [x] ROSETTA-STONE captures all terminology
- [x] Cautionary tales identified

**Verdict**: NOT YET SAFE TO DELETE. Five items remain pending. Once the Five Invariants are formalized, the Sovereignty Strata committed, the new aphorisms/proverbs added, and the CAPTURE > DISPATCH > RETURN mnemonic documented, Ajna threads 1-9 can be safely deleted with no knowledge loss.
