## The Best AI Image Generators: A Comprehensive Review

The most frequent question in the channel comments is, "What is the best image generator?"  We are going to answer that question today, but with a unique spin that should serve you better than a typical top 10 list. Off the top, this video is sponsored, though not by any AI image generator platform, so there is no bias. I actually partnered with **Zapier** on this one. They reached out and asked if I would be interested in adapting a blog article they wrote on this very topic. The article is very good and is linked below, but I had notes. Zapier was fine with that, saying, "Yeah, go ahead. Just make it your own".

I would be remiss if I didn't mention that if you're looking for the best place to automate your work by connecting 8,000+ apps like Google Sheets, Notion, and Slack without writing a single line of code, **Zapier** is the place to do it.

## An Overview of the Most Influential Image Generators

Let's kick things off with a look at some of the most influential AI image generators. There is no particular order because each one of these has its own strengths and weaknesses.

### Midjourney: The Most Influential Image Generator

Starting with a heavyweight, we have **Midjourney**. Arguably the most influential AI image generator, it launched in 2022 on Discord. It versioned up very quickly in that first year, and by version 4 (released in November of that same year), it had pretty much established itself as the leader of the pack in terms of artistic aesthetics in AI image generation. While more competition arose over time and others found their look, the dominance of Midjourney may have waned, though a lot of that comes down to personal taste.

In my opinion, Midjourney's core strength has always been the fact that you could generate very beautiful images with very simple prompts. Over the years, it has continued to iterate on its core, establishing more controls, dash-dash commands, and prompt tricks to the point where an entire cottage industry is built around it. As a criticism, a lot of those commands have now made their way into the area of **arcane knowledge** rather than intuitive design, which is a point of pride to the Midjourney hardcore—it's like AI image spellcasting. This certainly makes onboarding a newcomer more challenging.

That said, I still recommend it to newcomers as it is the easiest platform to generate really gorgeous images. To this day, no matter what you prompt, Midjourney is the tool for **image style exploration**. It is **not** the tool for repeatable and controllable images, for things like storyboards and comic book panels, although these are long-requested features that they are slowly working on.

Midjourney has **no free trial**. Its plans run between **\$10 and \$120 a month**. If you pay annually, that's **\$8 to \$96**. Personally, I would recommend the standard plan, as most people will get by with that amount of images per month.

### Leonardo.ai: The One With a Ton of Controls

Next up is **Leonardo.ai**, another OG player in the image generation space that also appeared in 2022. Leonardo differentiated itself by focusing on providing creators with a **higher degree of control**, repeatable styles, and aiming to be a more comprehensive toolkit for creative production.

Leonardo still offers a number of style presets, including the ability to train your own. You can also generate in Flux there (which we will discuss later) , and they have their own image generation model called **Phoenix**. Some standout features include **Flow State**, which generates images almost as fast as you can type them, and a very "slept on" **creative image upscaler**.

My main criticism of Leonardo is that it's "a lot"—there's so much you can do that a new user might end up in a state of **paralysis**. Additionally, I feel that a lot of the more powerful features are squirreled away in some very unintuitive spots.

Leonardo, in my opinion, is best suited for someone who has some experience with another AI image generator and has some time to explore its ins and outs.

Leonardo **does have a free tier**, so at the very minimum, I would recommend just signing up for it. From there, the monthly costs go from **\$12 to \$60**. If you go yearly, that is **\$10 to \$48**.

### Runway Frames: The One That References the Best

Moving on, our next contender is a newer one: **Runway's Frames**. Frames is Runway ML's own image generator, and it places a strong focus on maintaining consistency in style. While I was initially underwhelmed at launch, the release of their **reference feature** has turned it into a real powerhouse.

Runway is definitely at the leading edge of **one-shot image model referencing**. The model's internal architecture allows it to not only reference people, places, and things, but to **understand instructions visually**. The fact that you can use the reference feature as essentially a style reference gives you the opportunity to create a look that is wholly tailored to you.

Runway **does have a free trial of 125 credits**. You can use Frames and the reference feature there, though 125 credits won't get you a lot. From there, prices range from **\$15 to \$95**, with the \$95 tier being unlimited. The "unlimited" plan does have credits, and once you burn through them, you are in a **"slowboat mode,"** but I don't find the slowboat to be that slow.

### ChatGPT-4o Image Generator: The One that Chats the Most

Sliding over to the land of OpenAI, we have the **ChatGPT-4o image generator**. This isn't actually an image generator but rather ChatGPT simply understanding how to communicate visually. I do have to say that **prompt coherence** is very strong with this model, and the ability to place text in the scene is very impressive. Personally, I find some of the artistic stylizations a bit bland, but I might just need to spend more time with it.

I find it fun and interesting to generate images via a natural conversation in ChatGPT, though you will end up arguing with it quite a bit because the **content moderation can sometimes be baffling**. You can also use this model on the **Sora platform**, where it acts a bit more like a standard image generator without the conversational aspect. The aspect ratios are a bit baffling as you can still only generate in 1:1, 2:3, and 3:2.

You can generate images for **free in ChatGPT** with daily limits that range anywhere between **3 to 10 images a day**. The **\$20 subscription tier** allows you to generate **50 images every 3 hours**. With the Pro **\$200 a month** plan, you get more than 50 images every 3 hours, but they are "a little dodgy" about the exact number.

## More Contenders in the AI Image Space

### Ideogram: The King of Text

Sliding over to another personal favorite of mine, this is **Ideogram**, or as I like to call it, "the king of text". Ideogram officially launched in August of 2023 and made a significant splash with its ability to generate **accurate text**. While a number of other image generators have gotten better at text (like the ChatGPT-4o image generator) , the Ideogram team has been working on improving the image generation quality, aesthetics, and overall artistic flair.

Ideogram is now at a **3.0 model**. They have also introduced a **canvas editing feature** as well as **batch generation**. I find it to be a great tool for things like **brainstorming YouTube thumbnails**. The thumbnail for the highest-performing video on this channel, the AI Doom video, was a straight-up Ideogram image right out of the box. Additionally, if you're looking for things like book covers, title treatment explorations, or anything else involving text, give Ideogram a shot. They've got a really clean interface and one of the funniest community feeds you'll ever scroll through. I really don't have anything bad to say about Ideogram.

Pricing begins at **\$8 a month** for the basic plan, up to **\$60 a month** for the Pro plan. The middle plan, the Plus plan, is my long-time choice. If you pay yearly, you are looking at **\$7 a month, \$16 a month, and \$48 a month** for the three tiers.

### Adobe Firefly: The Commercially Safe One

Sliding over to what might be a controversial one for this list is **Adobe Firefly**. The Adobe team has made a lot of improvements over the last few years, and the Firefly model is turning out to be pretty serviceable. Firefly's main strengths are things that you would find in traditional kind of stock imagery. However, they have improved their artistic outputs and added a number of additional styles.

The biggest upside to Firefly, and why it's on this list, is the fact that it is backed by Adobe as being **completely commercially safe**, to the point where they'll take the hit if you get sued. If commercial safety is a concern for you, Firefly is the spot.

In terms of pricing, Firefly begins at **\$9.99 a month** for 2,000 credits. From there, it turns into a Pro plan at **\$29** and a Premium plan at **\$200**. After that, you're into the Creative Cloud apps.

### Flux and Where to Use It: The Open Source One

We have mostly been discussing AI image generation platforms, but we cannot ignore the bombshell that is **Flux**. Released by Black Forest Labs in August of 2024, Flux is an **open-source** AI image generator that was quickly hailed as the new king of the hill. While you can run Flux locally, I wanted to spotlight a few platforms where you can utilize it.

1.  **Freepik**: Here, you can utilize Flux and combine it with a number of preset styles. Freepik also has its own model called **Mystic**, which has long been speculated to be Flux combined with Magnific (the creative upscaler) and some additional "spank".
2.  **Krea**: This has been a longtime favorite of mine. Obviously, you can generate images there, and they have a plethora of video options, editing features, a real-time generator, and an enhanced feature. What's impressive about Krea is that anytime something new drops, they have it up, sometimes within hours of its release.
3.  **OpenArt.ai**: OpenArt definitely flies under the radar, but they have been building a great platform. Additionally, OpenArt covers the **Comfy UI** side of things, offering a number of Comfy workflows and a whole **Comfy Academy** series of videos if you want to learn how to use it.

On the Black Forest front, everyone is excited to see what **Flux 2.0** will look like when it eventually releases, as well as the long-awaited video generator.

### Rev (Dream): The Zen-like One

Next up, we have **Rev** (French for "dream"). Rev is a fairly newly released AI image generator that shot up the AI image leaderboards really quickly. This one excels in **photo realism**, although it is capable of doing a number of other styles as well.

Its weakness is actually its strength: there isn't much beyond prompting here, and that is kind of **liberating**. It's nice not to have 300 options of different stylization passes and 400 different editing tools; the layout is almost **zen-like**.

On top of that, although Rev does have paid credits, you get **20 credits a day completely for free**. In a totally reasonable turn, you can buy 500 credits for \$5, and each image costs one credit. For now, I recommend heading over, claiming your 20 free images per day, and just having a nice, relaxing time prompting and not having to think about a thousand different stylization passes.

### Recraft: The One for Designers

Next up, we have **Recraft**, a platform that is really worth looking at if you're a **designer**. They recently introduced their **Infinite Style** feature, which allows you to blend together numerous styles to create "infinite styles".

Where Recraft really shines is for those who work in **Illustrator or vector graphics or SVG files**, as there is a bevy of options for exporting using color palettes or turning images into vectors.

### Google's Imagen 4: The New Kid on the Block

Rounding out the list, we have **Google's Imagen 4** (or Imagine, as it was called on the IO stage). I've actually become an Imagen fan since version 3. I was not a fan of versions 1 and 2, but version 3 really started to showcase a remarkable amount of **prompt coherence** and overall imagination.

The base model of Imagen 4 will probably appear on most platforms. I believe that Krea, Freepik, and LTX Studio already have it, so via API, it will be available everywhere.

## Final Thoughts: So, Which One IS the Best?

Ultimately, this very much highlights that **there is no one image generator to rule them all**. In fact, you'll probably end up getting the best results when you take two of them and bash them together, plus do a little bit of **manual editing** on your own. AI imagery is getting really good, but you will always end up with the most unique and interesting stuff if you add a little of your own "elbow grease" in.
