# IIC CONSTELLATION PROTOCOLS
## Shared Communication and Integration Standards
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Created**: 2026-01-09
**Authority**: DIRECTIVE-042A
**Status**: OPERATIONAL

---

## PART I: OVERVIEW

### A. Purpose

This document establishes the cross-IIC communication standards that enable the five Identity-Intelligence Complexes to function as a coherent constellation rather than isolated silos. Without integration protocols, each IIC becomes an isolated island—with them, the constellation achieves emergent intelligence beyond any single account.

### B. The Five IICs

| IIC | Chain | Function | Guiding Virtues |
|-----|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **Acumen** | Information | Strategic reconnaissance | Perspicacity, Astuteness, Discernment |
| **Coherence** | Insight | Framework development | Clarity, Synthesis, Elegance |
| **Efficacy** | Expertise | Operational execution | Execution, Precision, Results |
| **Mastery** | Knowledge | Pedagogical design | Precision, Depth, Transmission |
| **Transcendence** | Wisdom | Meta-coordination | Wisdom, Purpose, Integration |

### C. Core Integration Principle

**Layer 7 Meta-Intelligence**: Cross-IIC synthesis protocols constitute the highest layer of the Seven-Layer Technosphere Stack ([[CANON-31130-SEVEN_LAYER-lunar-ACUMEN-planetary-INFORMATION]]). This layer doesn't exist within any single platform—it emerges from the coordinated interaction of multiple IICs.
