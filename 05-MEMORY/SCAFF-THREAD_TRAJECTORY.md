## PART 1: MAJOR DECISIONS BY THREAD

### Oracle 0-3: Pre-Directive Era (Documented in GENESIS-003)

**Decisions Made**:
1. **Six-Chain Architecture**: Intelligence, Information, Insight, Expertise, Knowledge, Wisdom selected as developmental domains
2. **Cosmological Metaphor**: Planetary architecture chosen as operational metaphor (not decoration)
3. **Recursive Amplification**: Central thesis that development in one domain feeds all others
4. **Dual-Mode Presentation**: Mythopoetic AND Operational modes for different cognitive styles
5. **Energy State System**: Peak/Baseline/Depletion/Crisis recognition for practice adaptation
6. **Progressive Disclosure**: Scale 1-4 (Micro/Meso/Macro/Meta) for complexity management

**Key Limitations Discovered**:
- Documents too long, too academic
- Cross-references inconsistent
- Terminology drifted between documents
- Operational protocols aspirational rather than practical

### Oracle 4: The Annealment

**Decisions Made**:
1. **Metabolic Principle Established**: "Canonize or delete" — no indefinite preservation
2. **Archive Tier Creation**: Historical materials organized
3. **79% File Reduction**: 658 → 136 files achieved
4. **Coherence/ Deletion**: 2.8M chars of Genesis material removed (later identified as error)

**Critical Error**:
- Deleted `orchestration/` directory as if it were CANON candidate
- Lost: execution_logs/, directives/, state/, history/
- Result: Oracle5 lost visibility into execution state

**Lesson Learned**: Orchestration logs are OPERATIONAL, not CANON — category error in deletion logic

### Oracle 5: Assessment Phase

**DIRECTIVE-017 Key Findings**:

1. **Genesis Layer Thesis**:
   - Gap identified: CANON specifies WHAT, nothing specifies WHY/HOW
   - Solution: Create GENESIS layer as narrative substrate

2. **Nomenclature Drift Identified**:
   - Mixed prepositional patterns in filenames
   - Missing standardized metadata
   - No manifest generation from frontmatter

3. **Missing Exempla**:
   - No demonstration layer showing system in practice

4. **Coherence Source Assessment**:
   - Deleted Coherence/ contained Genesis material, not archive material
   - 100% recoverable via git

5. **Tech Lunar Decision**:
   - 306K pending → Canonize as CANON-304xx (not reference material)

**Architectural Decision — Five-Tier Structure**:
```
GENESIS/     ← NEW: Narrative substrate (why, origins, principles)
CANON/       ← Constitutional (what, operational truth)
OPERATIONAL/ ← Living documents (how, active work)
QUEUE/       ← Pending items (time-bounded)
EXEMPLA/     ← NEW: Demonstrations (examples, case studies)
```

**DIRECTIVE-018 Decisions**:
- Two-stream architecture established (Alpha + Beta)
- Alpha: Archaeology & Assessment
- Beta: Transformation & Construction

### Oracle 6: Execution Phase

**DIRECTIVE-019 Decisions**:
- Orchestration infrastructure restored
- Category distinction formalized: OPERATIONAL ≠ CANON

**DIRECTIVE-020A Decisions**:
- Tech Lunar canonized as CANON-30400 through CANON-30450
- ARCHIVE/ finalized (3 files, ~43K)

**DIRECTIVE-020B Decisions**:
- YAML frontmatter schema designed
- 100% metadata coverage achieved (66 files)

**DIRECTIVE-021 Key Findings**:
1. Old numbering (CANON-1 to CANON-17): 4 files, 100+ references
2. Chain name inconsistency: 30+ files, 200+ references
3. Version misalignment: 65 files, 5 different versions

**DIRECTIVE-022A/B/C Decisions**:
- **22A**: All old numbering → 5-digit format
- **22B**: Chain names aligned (Option A — filenames as authoritative)
- **22C**: All versions normalized to 2.0.0

## PART 2: PARADIGM SHIFTS

### Key Reconceptions Identified

| Concept | Old Paradigm | New Paradigm | Source |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Chain Names | Technology/Sensing/Coherence/Efficacy/Embodiment/Transcendence | Intelligence/Information/Insight/Expertise/Knowledge/Wisdom | Oracle5/DIRECTIVE-022B |
| Orchestration | Disposable content (delete if not CANON) | Protected infrastructure (operational necessity) | Oracle5/DIRECTIVE-019 |
| Genesis Layer | Absent (deleted with Coherence/) | Structural necessity beneath CANON | Oracle5/DIRECTIVE-017 |
| CANON Numbering | 1-17 (sequential) | 5-digit hierarchical (00xxx-35xxx) | Oracle5/DIRECTIVE-022A |
| File Metadata | Ad-hoc inline versions | Standardized YAML frontmatter | Oracle5/DIRECTIVE-020B |
| Tech Lunar | Reference material (pending) | Canonical infrastructure (CANON-304xx) | Oracle5/DIRECTIVE-020A |

### Conceptual Discoveries

1. **Metabolism Over Accumulation**: The system values systematic deletion as much as creation

2. **Narrative as Infrastructure**: Genesis layer is not decoration but load-bearing structure

3. **Operational Distinction**:
   - CANON = constitutional truth (stable)
   - OPERATIONAL = living documents (evolving)
   - Orchestration = coordination infrastructure (ephemeral but necessary)

4. **Category Errors Have Consequences**: Deleting orchestration/ as if it were CANON caused Oracle5 visibility loss

5. **Kintsugi Mindset**: Breaks and repairs are part of the story, not failures to hide

## PART 3: DEPRECATED ELEMENTS

### Elements Deleted (Correct Decisions)

| Element | Size | Reason for Deletion |
|---------|------|---------------------|
| staging/ | ~2M | Superseded drafts |
| annealment/ | ~134K | Historical coordination (absorbed) |
| evaluation/ | ~147K | Superseded assessments |
| orchestration/history/ (old) | ~500K | Session records, ephemeral |

### Elements Deleted Then Reconceived

| Element | Size | Original Deletion Reason | Reconception |
|---------|------|-------------------------|--------------|
| Coherence/ | 2.8M | "Archival" | Restored as GENESIS layer |
| orchestration/ | ~700K | "Canonize or delete" | Restored as operational infrastructure |

### Old Terminology (Now Deprecated)

| Old Term | New Term | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Technology Chain | Intelligence Chain | Filename authoritative |
| Sensing Chain | Information Chain | Filename authoritative |
| Coherence Chain | Insight Chain | Preserves "Coherence" for planetary body |
| Efficacy Chain | Expertise Chain | Preserves "Efficacy" for planetary body |
| Embodiment Chain | Knowledge Chain | Preserves "Mastery" for planetary body |
| Transcendence Chain | Wisdom Chain | Preserves "Transcendence" for ring |
| CANON-1 through CANON-17 | CANON-00001 through CANON-35200 | 5-digit hierarchical |
| v2.3, v2.2, v1.x | v2.0.0 | Normalized post-annealment |

## PART 5: WISDOM EXTRACTED

### Principles Crystallized Across Oracle 0-5

1. **Metabolic Discipline**: "Canonize or delete" prevents bloat but requires category awareness

2. **Operational/Constitutional Distinction**: Not all valuable content is CANON; some is infrastructure

3. **Narrative Necessity**: Systems without story are systems without soul

4. **Recovery Architecture**: Git preserves everything; 100% recovery possible until commit

5. **Parallel Stream Efficiency**: Alpha (archaeology) + Beta (construction) enables velocity

6. **Reconnaissance Before Action**: DIRECTIVE-021 pattern prevents blind execution

7. **Terminology Precision**: Ambiguous terms cause systemic drift; lock definitions early

8. **Version Discipline**: Multiple versions create confusion; normalize aggressively
