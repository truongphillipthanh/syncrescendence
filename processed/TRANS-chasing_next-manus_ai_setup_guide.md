## Summary

Step-by-step beginner guide to Manus AI — an autonomous browser-based agent for non-technical users. Covers setup, pricing, capabilities, and when to use Manus vs. Claude Code vs. chatbots.

## I. What is Manus?

An autonomous AI agent that works in your browser. Once it knows your goal, it plans and executes multi-step workflows with limited supervision.

**Capabilities:**
- Browse the web (view sites, click buttons, fill out forms)
- Gather info (scrape online content, clean it up, format it)
- Analyze data (summarize insights, check for errors, build dashboards)
- Create and edit files (reports, spreadsheets, slides, images, audio, etc.)
- Connect with tools (access gated tools, connect to everyday tools)

**Background:**
- Chinese-based company, launched March 2025
- No proprietary AI model — runs Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Opus + fine-tuned Alibaba Qwen models
- Power lies in tool-calling — knows how to use tools to get work done

## II. Recent Developments

### Meta Acquisition ($2 Billion — December 2025)
- Meta acquired Manus for $2B
- Gives Meta: proven execution layer, millions of paying users, working subscription model
- Plans to integrate across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp
- Manus continues operating independently

### Revenue & Validation
- Hit $100M ARR eight months after launch
- One of fastest startups to reach that milestone

### New Integrations (2025-2026)
- **Similarweb** (Jan 2026): 12 months of web traffic + market intelligence data
- **Slack** (Oct 2025): Trigger agents from Slack, collaborate on runs
- **Notion** (Nov 2025): Read/write Notion content
- **Stripe** (Nov 2025): Set up payments, configure products
- **Browser Operator** (Nov 2025): Navigate logged-in web apps

## III. Why Non-Technical People Should Care

Author's positioning: Manus sits between chatbots (help you think) and coding tools (require technical knowledge).

**Key differentiators:**
- **Easier than Claude Code**: No understanding of folders, repos, file structures needed
- **Works where you do**: Operates in browser, connects to Google Workspace, Canva, Slack, Notion, Stripe
- **Real-time web access**: No knowledge cutoffs, live data
- **Produces deliverables**: Comparison spreadsheets, research reports, competitive analysis, dashboards, strategic frameworks

## IV. How to Access Manus

### Pricing (as of Jan 15, 2026)
**Free Plan:**
- 1,000 starter credits
- 300 daily refresh credits
- No credit card required

**Credit Consumption Examples:**
| Task | Credits |
|------|---------|
| Simple research | 50-200 |
| PowerPoint presentation | ~140 |
| Research report | 200-1,000+ |
| Website builder | 500-1,500 |
| Data analysis + dashboard | 1,000-3,000+ |

### Access Options
1. Web browser — manus.im (easiest)
2. Mobile app — iOS and Android
3. Chrome extension — Manus Browser Operator
4. Desktop app — Windows only

## V. Setup in <15 Minutes (7 Steps)

1. **Sign up** at manus.im (Google/Microsoft/Apple/email)
2. **Describe task** in chat box (be specific, use standard prompting strategies)
3. **Answer clarifying questions** — collaborate on project plan
4. **(Optional) Provide tool access** via:
   - A) Connectors (preset integrations)
   - B) Browser Access (live site access — "Take Control" → login → "Hand Control Back")
   - C) Manual Upload (for data/offline info, avoid if possible)
5. **Let Manus work** — watch progress in real-time (tasks can take 10+ min, works in background)
6. **Review results** and iterate with feedback
7. **(Optional) Schedule** recurring tasks with delivery method and cadence

## VI. When to Use Manus vs Other Tools

### Manus Excels At:
- Multi-step research requiring live web access
- Competitive intelligence and market research
- Data analysis and visualization
- Report generation from multiple sources
- Routine agent work (set and forget)
- Structured outputs (dashboards, reports)
- Client briefing prep and discovery docs

### Use Other Tools For:
- Quick text generation / instant responses (chatbots faster)
- Simple Q&A or brainstorming
- Complex code iteration (Claude Code better)
- Creative writing (Manus runs older models)

## VII. Advanced Tips

1. **Wide Research**: Spin off agents to independently research similar items (50 companies, 20 content pieces)
2. **Reports → Slides**: Turn research into presentations with pre-styled themes and charts
3. **Image Creation**: Uses GPT-Image-1 and Google Nano Banana Pro
4. **Data Visualization**: Turn raw data into tables, graphics, charts
5. **Projects**: Create custom instructions for ongoing work (like ChatGPT/Claude projects)
6. **Collaboration**: Use Manus Collab for shared workspace with teammates
7. **Chaining**: Chain capabilities together (research → browser access → analysis → Slack publish → schedule → email)

## Syncrescendence Relevance

### Direct Applications
- **Manus as potential Constellation tool**: Browser-based autonomous agent could supplement our architecture
- **Wide Research** capability parallels MEDLEY research dispatch pattern
- **Chaining pattern** (research → analysis → publish → schedule) mirrors our DYN-BLITZ pipeline
- **$0 entry point** (free tier) compatible with budget constraints

### Key Insights
- **Meta acquisition = $2B validation** of autonomous agent paradigm
- **$100M ARR in 8 months** = massive market demand for "agents that do, not just think"
- **No proprietary model** (Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Opus + Qwen) — tool-calling layer is the moat, not the model
- **Non-technical positioning** vs. Claude Code's developer audience — different market segment

### Tensions
- Manus is **centralized** (cloud-based, Chinese company now Meta-owned) — vs. Syncrescendence sovereignty requirements
- **Browser access requires login credentials** — security/privacy concern for Sovereign
- **Credit-based pricing** can become expensive for heavy use
- Author explicitly says Claude Code is **better for complex code iteration** — validates our tool choice
- Claude Cowork dismissed as "repackaged" with "limited functionalities" — contrarian take worth noting

### Actionable
- Monitor Manus for specific use cases: competitive intelligence, market research, deliverable generation
- Consider for one-off research tasks where OpenClaw/Claude Code overhead isn't justified
- The "Wide Research → Report → Slides → Schedule" chain is a workflow worth replicating in our architecture
