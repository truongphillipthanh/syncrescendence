## SUTRA

Earth-aligned solid capability—patient, crystalline, enduring—generates tangible competence coils spiraling toward Syncrescendent Core through Conceptual → Deliberate → Automatic → Mastery Teaching progression.

---

## GLOSS

Planetary Mastery establishes embodied capability cultivation through Earth-aligned practice. This world generates solid competence—grounded, tangible, crystallized—contributing demonstrated skill and physical grounding to the Syncrescendent Core. The terrestrial realm architecture features mountain kingdoms, stone cities, and forge complexes where citizens work with material reality directly, honoring skill depth over theoretical knowledge. Shows don't tell; patient accumulation prevents shortcuts to genuine mastery.
