# Κ-00004: The Evolution (SN)

TERM EvolutionPurpose:
    sutra: "Systems hiding history become incomprehensible—honor history, build trust"
    gloss:
        Ψ documents its own development through Oracle sessions and structural
        decisions. This record enables understanding of how current state emerged
        and why certain decisions were made. Living history, not static archive.

TERM DefragDecision:
    sutra: "79% reduction—signal preserved, noise eliminated, brutally necessary"
    gloss:
        December 30, 2025: Principal authorized Metabolic Defrag, most aggressive
        reduction in corpus history. Framework had become unnavigable, inconsistent,
        cruft-laden, bloated. Reduction preserved signal and eliminated noise.
    spec:
        before:
            files: ~658
            directories: ~914
            characters: ~12.7M

            autopsychography: ~90_files | deep_personal_excavation
            orchestration_history: all_Oracle_session_records
            cognitive_palace_core: 14_files | implementation_experiments
        why_correct:
            - unnavigable_too_many_files
            - inconsistent_unpredictable
            - cruft_laden_no_active_purpose
            - bloated_repeated_content
end

TERM Kintsugi:
    sutra: "Scars are features—gold in the breaks makes history visible and beautiful"
    gloss:
        Japanese art repairs broken pottery with gold. Ψ applies this: early
        failures, terminology drift, archive bloat, structural issues all
        metabolized into current architecture. Not embarrassment but evidence.
    spec:
        what_was_broken:
            - early_frameworks_that_didn't_work
            - terminology_that_drifted
            - archives_that_bloated
            - structures_that_couldn't_scale

PASS Reconception:
    sutra: "Two streams converge—archaeological recovery + transformation implementation"
    gloss:
        Post-Defrag, comprehensive transformation authorized. Genesis layer
        created, lineage traced, principles distilled, evolution documented.
        Stream Alpha recovers what's restorable; Stream Beta implements transformation.
    spec:
        Stream_Alpha:
            - assess_restorable_from_deleted
            - validate_OPERATIONAL_coherence

end

NORM PrinciplesLearned:
    sutra: "Six lessons—start messy, discipline simplicity, narrative is structural"
    gloss:
        Evolution teaches: start messy and iterate; complexity accumulates,
        simplicity requires discipline; narrative is structural not decorative;
        tools shape output; humility is practical; time reveals truth.
    spec:
        1: start_messy >> iterate_toward_clarity | launch_learn_revise
        2: complexity_accumulates | simplicity_requires_discipline | build_deletion_into_architecture
        3: narrative_is_structural | Genesis_layer_load_bearing | systems_without_story_without_soul
        4: tools_shape_output | AI_altered_what_possible
        5: humility_is_practical | admitting_error_enables_revision
        6: time_reveals_truth | essential_becomes_dispensable | peripheral_becomes_central
end

ARTIFACT PresentMoment:
    sutra: "Coherent and incomplete, navigable and evolving—both must remain true"
    gloss:
        Current state: CANON (58 files), GENESIS (4 files), OPERATIONAL (prompts/functions),
        QUEUE (pending). System is coherent AND incomplete. The moment Ψ claims
        completion, it begins to die. Evolution continues through participation.
    spec:
        current_state:
            CANON: 58_files | complete_cosmological_architecture
            GENESIS: 4_files | narrative_substrate
            OPERATIONAL: prompts | functions | AI_collaboration
            QUEUE: pending_canonization_or_deletion
        truths:
            - coherent | navigable | operational
            - incomplete | imperfect | evolving
        invariant: both_statements_must_remain_true
        death_condition: claims_completion
