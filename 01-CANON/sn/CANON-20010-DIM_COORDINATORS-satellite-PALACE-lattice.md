# Κ-20010: Dimensional Coordinators (SN)

TERM SevenCoordinators:
    sutra: "Seven orchestrating intelligences—pattern recognition, gentle enhancement, invisible by default"
    gloss:
        Seven Dimensional Coordinators manage Cognitive Palace layers. Each
        observes natural patterns and provides gentle enhancement without
        forcing rigid structures. True intelligence operates like excellent
        health—most powerful when least noticed.
