## SUTRA

Fire-aligned catalytic will—transformative, directed, consuming—generates decision coils spiraling toward Syncrescendent Core through Abstract → Initiation → Sustainable → Transcendent progression.

---

## GLOSS

Planetary Efficacy establishes volitional capacity cultivation through Fire-aligned transformation practices. This world generates directed force—catalytic, decisive, consuming—contributing transformative will and strategic clarity to the Syncrescendent Core. Practitioners develop decision quality, economic capability, executive function, and volitional mobilization through four stages toward transcendent contribution. The volcanic realm architecture features forge temples, crucible laboratories, and decision chambers where citizens work with transformative forces deliberately.
