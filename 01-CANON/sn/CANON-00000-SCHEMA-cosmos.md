# Κ-00000: Syncrescendent Schema (SN)

TERM NavigationalBlueprint:
    sutra: "Map of maps—six dimensions, one coordinate system for infinite development"
    gloss:
        The schema answers "where am I and how do I move?" across the complete Ψ
        architecture. Practitioners orient through six orthogonal dimensions that
        combine freely. This prevents overwhelm by providing structured navigation.
    spec:
        purpose: orientation | navigation | troubleshooting
        prerequisite_for: all_other_canon
        entry_point: true
        practitioners_use:
            - understand_system_architecture
            - navigate_71_canon_dependencies
            - track_developmental_progress
            - identify_tier_appropriate_entry
            - troubleshoot_systematically
end

TERM SixDimensions:

    gloss:
        Dimensions are ORTHOGONAL—Scale:1-Micro with Level:3-Advanced is valid.
        No sequencing required between dimensions. Each maps distinct developmental
        territory. Precision format required for unambiguous communication.
    spec:
        independence_principle: dimensions_are_completely_independent

        precision_requirement: "Level: 2-Intermediate in Intelligence Chain" (never "Level 2")
end

PASS Dimension1_Scale:
    sutra: "Cosmological engagement depth—micro to meta, all honored equally"
    gloss:
        Scale measures how much architecture a practitioner engages, NOT superiority.
        Many practitioners remain Scale:1-Micro indefinitely—this is honored, not lesser.

end

PASS Dimension2_Level:
    sutra: "Chain-specific competence—always specify which chain"
    gloss:

        Degree applies exclusively to Lunar systems within Coherence and
        Transcendence chains. Six stages from latent to transmission.
    spec:

TERM SystemArchitecture:
    sutra: "Core radiates to planets, returns amplified—recursive spiral upward"
    gloss:
        Central hypergiant (Ψ Core) radiates enabling energy to four planetary
        bodies, receiving refined returns through luminous coils. Six chains
        progress through seven-layer Cognitive Palace substrate.
    spec:

TERM CorrespondenceMatrix:
    sutra: "Planets align chains align layers—vertical integration, horizontal coupling"
    gloss:
        Elegant integration where development in one domain enhances aligned
        domains. Planetary bodies, chains, and layers share essence through
        vertical alignment and horizontal coupling.

PROC IntegrationCheckpoints:
    sutra: "Daily pulses to annual dissolution—timescales prevent fragmentation"
    gloss:
        Multiple timescales from momentary awareness to annual review serve
        distinct developmental functions. Each timescale integrates differently.

PASS ProgressiveDisclosure:
    sutra: "Reveal complexity when ready—lower scales not lesser, just appropriate"
    gloss:
        Progressive disclosure honors developmental readiness. Each scale
        represents capacity expansion, not arbitrary sequencing. Tier advancement
        is optional.

PROC TierDown:
    sutra: "Tier-down is healthy adaptation, not failure—honor reduced capacity"
    gloss:
        Energy states fluctuate with life circumstances. Tier advancement is

TERM IntegrationCoefficient:
    sutra: "κ measures alignment—chains, planets, layers in coherent unity"
    gloss:
        Integration coherence coefficient quantifies how well development
        aligns across system components. Below 0.50 indicates severe fragmentation.
    spec:
        formula: κ = (chain_alignments + planetary_coherence + layer_integration) / 3
        interpretation:

PROC Troubleshooting:
    sutra: "Eight failure modes, eight resolution pathways—diagnose then resolve"

NORM TerminologyPrecision:
    sutra: "Specify dimension and chain—ambiguity breeds confusion"
    gloss:
        Precision requirements prevent communication failures. Never use
        ambiguous terms. Always qualify dimensional references.
