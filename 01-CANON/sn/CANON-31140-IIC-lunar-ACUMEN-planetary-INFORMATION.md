## SUTRA

IIC Constellation enables five-modality cognitive architecture where each email-anchored identity operates as teleologically configured intelligence agent across all technology layers.

---

## GLOSS

This artifact establishes the architectural framework for Identity-Intelligence Complexes—the multi-account system enabling chain-specific cognitive development. Where CANON-31130 defines the seven-layer stack, this document defines HOW to configure multiple identities across that stack with coherent purpose. The five IIC modalities (Acumen, Coherence, Efficacy, Mastery, Transcendence) map directly to five of Syncrescendence's six chains, each maintaining distinct cognitive personality, feed curation philosophy, and output orientation while integrating through explicit handoff protocols.

## SPEC

### TERM::IICArchitecture
```
sutra: Email identity >> configured intelligence agent | seven-layer coherence

spec:
  core_insight: |
    As AI permeates every layer and identity federation creates portable context,
    each email account becomes deliberately configured lens-agent carrying:
    - accumulated preferences
    - learned behaviors
    - platform-specific training
    across entire technology stack

  architecture_elements:
    - five_modalities: Acumen | Coherence | Efficacy | Mastery | Transcendence
    - two_tiers: Personal (development) | Organizational (demonstration)
    - seven_layer_coherence: each IIC configured across L0-L7
    - handoff_protocols: explicit IIC-to-IIC information flow
    - lifecycle_management: activation | maturation | integration
```
