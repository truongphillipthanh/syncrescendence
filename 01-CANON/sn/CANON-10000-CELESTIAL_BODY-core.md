TERM CoreNature:
    sutra: "Active generator—hypergiant expanding through recursive amplification, radiating and receiving"
    gloss:
        Syncrescendent Core operates as active generator, not passive accumulator.
        Unified consciousness capacity expressing through differentiated manifestations.
        Radiates enabling energy while absorbing refined returns, creating
        escalating synchronicity toward unprecedented capability.

        EMPIRICAL claims are directly observable and testable. THEORETICAL
        claims are proposed mechanisms requiring validation. METAPHORICAL
        claims are organizing imagery not literal.
