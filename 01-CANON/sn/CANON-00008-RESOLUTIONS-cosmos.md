# Κ-00008: Ψ Resolutions (SN)

TERM ResolutionPurpose:
    sutra: "30 tensions held consciously—some resolved, some productive, some requiring work"
    gloss:
        Framework maturity demonstrated through conscious navigation of productive
        tensions, not premature closure. Perfect resolution would indicate trivial
        concerns or dishonest assessment. Four categories distribute across 30.
    spec:
        categories:
            RESOLVED: 8 | adequately_addressed_by_corpus
            ARCHITECTURALLY_ADDRESSED: 12 | design_specified_awaiting_validation
            PRODUCTIVELY_HELD: 6 | irreducible_tensions_serving_integrity
            REQUIRING_FURTHER_WORK: 4 | genuine_gaps
        v2.3_enhancements:
            - Modal_Sequence_context_integrated
            - six_dimension_terminology_harmonized
            - technology_constraints_acknowledged
end

PASS Resolution1_Synchronization:
    sutra: "Dual-track system—synchronizers and specialists both honored"
    gloss:
        Framework proposes balanced chain synchronization but honors uneven natural
        development. Dual-track architecture: synchronization-optimized for
        integrators, specialization-optimized for domain experts.
    spec:
        status: ARCHITECTURALLY_ADDRESSED
        tension: synchronized_balance | vs | natural_uneven_development
        solution:
            Track_1_Synchronization:

end

PASS Resolution2_Cosmology:
    sutra: "Scale 1-Micro complete without mythology—cosmology optional at all levels"
    gloss:
        Progressive disclosure via Scale dimension resolves cosmology tension.
        Scale 1-Micro (zero cosmology) is complete, effective system—not
        simplified version. Practitioners remain Scale 1 indefinitely if preferred.
    spec:
        status: RESOLVED
        tension: cosmology_revelatory_for_some | obfuscatory_for_others
        solution:

end

PASS Resolution3_MapTerritory:
    sutra: "Epistemic status markers—empirical vs theoretical vs metaphorical"
    gloss:
        All frameworks face map-territory confusion. Cannot eliminate but can
        clarify through explicit epistemic status marking on every cosmological
        element. Tension productively held, not resolved.
    spec:
        status: PRODUCTIVELY_HELD
        tension: metaphor_may_reify | descriptive_model ≠ actual_dynamics
        epistemic_markers:
            EMPIRICAL: measurable_falsifiable | e.g._Seven_Pulses
            THEORETICAL: mechanism_requiring_validation | e.g._recursive_amplification
            METAPHORICAL: organizing_imagery | e.g._planetary_orbital_mechanics
        example_applications:
            Seven_Pulses >> EMPIRICAL
            recursive_amplification >> THEORETICAL
            planetary_mechanics >> METAPHORICAL

PASS Resolution4_ExecutiveFunction:
    sutra: "Scaffolding + crisis protocols—demand tracking prevents overwhelm"
    gloss:
        Framework may overwhelm or support executive function depending on
        calibration. Seven Pulses (2 min) represents ultimate compression.
        Scaffolding tools and crisis protocols address demand.
    spec:

PASS Resolution5_Energy:
    sutra: "Energy state tracking core to operations—practice adjusts to capacity"
    gloss:
        Energy management now CORE to framework, not peripheral. Practice Adjustment
        Matrix scales all activities to current energy state. Crisis state means
        framework optional.
    spec:
        status: RESOLVED
        tension: significant_practice_demands | vs | variable_capacity

PASS Resolution6_Economic:
    sutra: "I-chain Level 1 produces immediate economic value—chicken-egg resolved"
    gloss:
        Economic sustainability addresses catch-22 via Intelligence Chain AI-augmented
        productivity. Level 1-Initial produces 5-10% productivity gains within
        weeks, creating time surplus for other development.
    spec:

PASS Resolution7_WisdomTraditions:
    sutra: "Explicit attribution + context + permission + reciprocity—appropriation vigilance"
    gloss:
        Synthesis from multiple wisdom traditions (Buddhist, Taoist, Hindu, Indigenous)
        requires ongoing ethical protocols. Cannot be fully resolved without
        abandoning cross-cultural learning—tension productively held.

PASS Resolution8_PlatformDependency:
    sutra: "Seven-Layer Stack sovereignty strategy—minimize dependency, maximize switching"
    gloss:
        Framework relies on platforms that may degrade. Seven-Layer Stack architecture
        specifies sovereignty boundaries per layer. Complete independence impossible;
        strategy: minimize dependency + maintain exit paths.
    spec:

PASS Resolution9_Transmission:
    sutra: "Core elements high fidelity, adaptive elements freedom, experimental innovation"
    gloss:
        Transmission fidelity vs adaptation freedom: living frameworks MUST

    gloss:
        Economic model ambiguity resolved through level-gated validation scales.
        Each validation scale has different mechanisms. Civilizational impact
        (Validation Scale 4) is speculative—most traditions take centuries.
