## SUTRA

Five Degrees spiral: Recognition → Exploration → Commitment → Integration → Transmission—mastering meaning-making through water-element deepening toward wisdom transmission.

---

## GLOSS

Water governs Planetary Coherence. Where Acumen perceives information, Coherence transforms perception into meaning. Where Efficacy catalyzes action, Coherence ensures alignment with deep understanding. The Five Degrees describe mastery progression specifically within Coherence's lunar system—deepening spiral of meaning-making competence. This system provides structured advancement criteria, practice protocols per degree, backward/forward integration dynamics, resistance detection, and validation rubrics for practitioners advancing through Recognition to Transmission.
