# CANON-35121: Neurodivergent Patterns
## AuDHD Implementation Satellite

**Parent Document**: [[CANON-35120-NEURODIVERGENT-lunar-TRANSCENDENCE-ring-WISDOM]] (Neurodivergent Practice Adaptations)
**Chain**: WISDOM → TRANSCENDENCE ring → NEURODIVERGENT lunar
**Status**: Canonical

> *Where [[CANON-35120-NEURODIVERGENT-lunar-TRANSCENDENCE-ring-WISDOM]] establishes the framework for neurodivergent practice adaptation, this satellite provides implementation-level patterns for the AuDHD (Autism + ADHD) phenotype.*

---

## Purpose

This document translates neurodivergent theory into operational protocols. The AuDHD profile presents unique challenges: paradoxical combinations of rigidity and impulsivity, hypersensitivity and sensory-seeking, pattern-recognition and attention scatter. Understanding these mechanisms enables practical accommodation rather than theoretical acknowledgment.

---

## 1. Executive Function Mechanisms

### The Additive Comorbidity Model

AuDHD executive function deficits combine vulnerabilities from both neurotypes:

**From Autistic Profile:**
- **Cognitive Flexibility**: Difficulty shifting thinking and adapting to changing demands
- **Planning**: Multi-step tasks feel overwhelming; organizing/sequencing future actions impaired

**From ADHD Profile:**
- **Response Inhibition**: Difficulty controlling impulsive responses and withholding inappropriate actions

**Shared Vulnerabilities:**
- Working memory deficits
- Attention regulation challenges
- Verbal fluency difficulties

### Practical Implications

Task design must account for BOTH impulsivity AND rigidity simultaneously. This seeming contradiction requires:

1. **Clear structure** (accommodates autistic need for predictability)
2. **Built-in flexibility** (accommodates ADHD need for variety)
3. **Explicit transition support** (neither profile handles transitions well)
4. **Simple enough to maintain** despite ADHD chaos

---

## 2. The Knowing-Doing Gap

### Definition

*"I am smart, I know exactly what to do, but I cannot make my brain and body do it."*

This gap between intellectual capacity and functional output is central to AuDHD experience. Intelligence often masks executive dysfunction, creating unrealistic expectations.

### The Spiky Cognitive Profile

AuDHD individuals show significant discrepancies between domains:

| Domain | Typical Performance |
|--------|-------------------|
| Verbal Reasoning | Within normal range |
| Nonverbal Reasoning | Within normal range |
| Processing Speed | ~1 standard deviation below mean |
| Working Memory | Moderately below mean |

### Compensation Strategies

1. **Externalize Everything**: Move working memory burden to external systems (notes, calendars, visual reminders, written instructions)
2. **Reduce Load**: Break complex tasks into single-step units—one action per instruction
3. **Prime Context**: Use environmental cues to trigger next actions rather than relying on memory
4. **Accept Variability**: High capability one day, incapacitated the next—plan for inconsistency as baseline, not exception

---

## 3. Sensory Processing Integration

### The Sensory Seesaw

AuDHD involves paradoxical co-existence of opposing sensory needs:

**Hypersensitivity (Sensory Avoidance)**
- Low sensory threshold
- Bright lights, loud noises, textures experienced as painful
- Motivation: protect from sensory overload

**Hyposensitivity (Sensory Seeking)**
- High sensory threshold
- Craving for intense input: loud music, pressure, movement
- Motivation: provide input for regulation

### Practical Applications

Create environments accommodating BOTH needs:
- Weighted blanket + noise-canceling headphones = pressure input without auditory overload
- Bass-heavy music through headphones = controlled stimulation for focus
- Texture-neutral clothing + proprioceptive tools = comfort without understimulation

### Interoception Deficits

Difficulty perceiving internal body states creates systematic blind spots:
- Hunger not registered until weakness/dizziness
- Thirst not registered until severe dehydration
- Full bladder becomes emergency
- Emotions not registered until overwhelming intensity

**Protocol**: Proactive scheduling of bodily needs (eating, drinking, breaks) rather than relying on internal signals. Set external timers. Do not trust hunger/thirst signals.

---

## 4. Energy Management Protocols

### The Broken Fuel Gauge Model

Two factors combine catastrophically:

1. **Hyper-vigilant neuroception**: Nervous system constantly scanning for threats, consuming resources invisibly
2. **Poor interoception**: Unable to sense resource depletion until crisis

Result: Body runs marathon at sprint pace while mind remains unaware of exertion. The "wall" of burnout represents physiological point of no return—accumulated resource debt becomes overwhelming, forcing emergency shutdown.

### The Competency Trap

Highly practiced masking + ADHD bursts of hyper-productivity = illusion of high competence.

This sets unsustainable expectations—from self and others. When inevitable burnout occurs, it appears as personal failure rather than predictable outcome of prolonged overexertion.

### Energy Management Principles

1. **Assume Lower Baseline**: Plan capacity at 60% of apparent capability
2. **Build Recovery Into Schedule**: Not as reward for productivity, but as necessary maintenance
3. **Monitor External Signals**: Use observable indicators (irritability, mistake rate, physical tension) since internal signals are unreliable
4. **Protect Transition Energy**: Context switches are disproportionately costly—budget accordingly

---

## 5. Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)

### Neurological Basis

Extreme, intensely painful emotional response to *perception* of rejection, criticism, or failure. Not simply dislike—described as unbearable. Physical pain metaphors are literal, not figurative.

### Manifestations

- Sudden outburst of anger/rage
- Immediate flood of tears
- Rapid descent mimicking major depressive episode
- Often misdiagnosed as rapid-cycling mood disorder

### Coping Patterns

**Pattern 1: People-Pleasing/Perfectionism**
- Hyper-vigilance to others' expectations
- Striving to be above reproach
- Presenting "false self" tailored to perceived desires

**Pattern 2: Risk Avoidance**
- Stop trying new things
- Avoid situations with possible judgment
- Leads to underachievement relative to capability

### RSD and Masking

RSD is primary engine driving masking maintenance. Masking defends against neurologically unbearable social pain. Unmasking feels terrifying because it exposes self to profound emotional wound.

Recognition: The fear is real. The pain is real. Accommodation requires acknowledging this reality, not dismissing it.

---

## 6. Double-Masking Dynamics

### The Layered Performance

AuDHD individuals engage in double-mask, simultaneously concealing traits from both neurotypes:

**Example**: Using memorized script (masking autistic trait) WHILE exerting energy to prevent interrupting (masking ADHD trait)

Each mask requires cognitive resources. The combination is exponentially—not additively—exhausting.

### Long-Term Consequences

- Primary driver of exhaustion and burnout
- Linked to severe anxiety, depression
- Profound loss of personal identity
- Heightened risk of suicidal ideation
- Delays accurate diagnosis (struggles invisible to clinicians)

### The Competency Trap (Revisited)

Double-masking creates external competence that is fundamentally unsustainable. Performance drops are shocking to observers and self—internalized as failure rather than predictable exhaustion.

**Protocol**: Create mask-optional contexts. Identify safe spaces where double-masking is not required. Budget heavy-masking situations and plan recovery.

---

## 7. Justice Sensitivity

### Neurobiological Basis

Innate disposition rooted in ADHD neurobiology:
- Interest-driven nervous system hyperfocuses on meaningful concepts
- Heightened amygdala reactivity amplifies feelings of injustice
- Rumination causes getting "stuck" on inequity

### Four Domains

1. **Victim Sensitivity**: Distress when personally treated unfairly
2. **Observer Sensitivity**: Distress witnessing mistreatment of others
3. **Beneficiary Sensitivity**: Guilt when benefiting from unfair advantage
4. **Perpetrator Sensitivity**: Intense guilt when causing harm (even unintentionally)

### Implications

- Can fuel powerful dedication to advocacy and social change
- Can become significant source of emotional burnout
- Feels weight of world's problems at physiological level

**Protocol**: Channel justice sensitivity into bounded, effective action. Infinite engagement with injustice depletes without resolution. Select battles. Define scope. Permit disengagement without guilt.

---

## 8. Stimming as Regulation Tool

### Dual Regulatory Function

**When Overstimulated (Autistic Need)**
- Stimming soothes and grounds
- Rhythmic, predictable sensory input blocks overwhelming external stimuli

**When Understimulated (ADHD Need)**
- Fidgeting provides input for focus and alertness
- Discharges excess energy

### Common Stims

- Rocking, hand-flapping, spinning, tapping, vocalizing
- Fidgeting with objects
- Rhythmic movements
- Skin-picking, hair-twisting (potentially harmful—redirect, don't suppress)

### Practical Accommodation

- Allow stimming in work/focus contexts—it enables function
- Provide acceptable alternatives (fidget tools, movement breaks)
- Recognize stimming as functional, not pathological
- Suppressed stimming increases cognitive load and reduces available resources

---

## Integration with Syncrescendent Practice

### Seven Pulses Adaptation

Reference [[CANON-35120-NEURODIVERGENT-lunar-TRANSCENDENCE-ring-WISDOM]] for tier-down protocols. This satellite adds:

- **Cognitive tracking**: The Knowing-Doing Gap means pulse awareness may not translate to action. Build external triggers.
- **Sensory-aware pulse selection**: Overstimulated states require low-sensory pulse options. Understimulated states benefit from movement-based practices.

### Daily Practice Considerations

1. **Morning**: Schedule eating/drinking before relying on hunger signals
2. **Transitions**: Budget extra time and energy for context switches
3. **Afternoon**: Monitor external exhaustion indicators (not internal sense)
4. **Evening**: Create mask-optional recovery space
5. **Throughout**: Allow stimming without judgment

### Crisis Protocol Addition

When RSD triggers:
1. Name it: "This is RSD, not objective reality"
2. Do not make decisions in acute state
3. Wait minimum 90 minutes before evaluating
4. Seek external perspective if available

---

## Summary

The AuDHD phenotype requires protocols that honor paradox: structure AND flexibility, stimulation AND protection, connection AND solitude. Generic advice fails because it addresses one pole while ignoring its opposite.

Effective accommodation requires:
- Externalizing cognitive load
- Scheduling bodily needs proactively
- Budgeting energy at 60% capacity
- Creating mask-optional spaces
- Allowing regulation tools (stimming)
- Naming and managing RSD
- Channeling justice sensitivity sustainably

These are not accommodations for weakness—they are infrastructure for sustainable function given neurological reality.
