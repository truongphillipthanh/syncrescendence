## PART I: FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION

### Master Schema Reference Frame

This document uses **five orthogonal dimensions** to locate practitioner position:

**Dimension 1: Scale** (Sophistication)  
Format: Scale: [1-4]-[Name] = Micro/Meso/Macro/Meta  
*Independent*—no ordering requirement

**Dimension 2: Level** (Chain Progression)  
Format: Level: [1-4]-[Name] [Chain]  
*Sequential*—advancement requires mastery at previous level

**Dimension 3: Degree** (Lunar Mastery) ← **PRIMARY FOR NAVIGATION**  
Format: Degree: [1-5]-[Name]  
Names: Recognition → Exploration → Commitment → Integration → Transmission  
*Lunar systems only* (Insight Chain & Wisdom Chain)

**Dimension 4: Stage** (Platform Maturity)  
Format: Stage: [1-5]-[Name]  
*Organizational*—independent from practitioner development

**Dimension 5: Phase** (Business Timeline)  
Format: Phase: [Name] Phase  
*Chronological*—Foundation → Validation → Scaling → Institute → Infrastructure
