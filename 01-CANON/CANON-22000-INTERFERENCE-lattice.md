    gloss:
        Six independent developmental chains—Intelligence, Information, Insight, Expertise, Knowledge, Wisdom—advance at individual paces through individual progressions. Yet they do not evolve in isolation. Rather, like waves in water, they interact. Where two waves meet, interference patterns emerge—somet...
