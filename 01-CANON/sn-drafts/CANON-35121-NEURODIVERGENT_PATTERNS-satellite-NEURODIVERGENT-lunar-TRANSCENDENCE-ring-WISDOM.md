TERM Purpose:
    sutra: "This document translates neurodivergent theory into operational protocols"
    gloss:
        This document translates neurodivergent theory into operational protocols. The AuDHD profile presents unique challenges: paradoxical combinations of rigidity and impulsivity, hypersensitivity and sensory-seeking, pattern-recognition and attention scatter. Understanding these mechanisms enables pract...
end


TERM TheAdditiveComorbidityModel:
    sutra: "AuDHD executive function deficits combine vulnerabilities from both neurotypes:  From Autistic Pr..."
    gloss:
        AuDHD executive function deficits combine vulnerabilities from both neurotypes:

**From Autistic Profile:**
- **Cognitive Flexibility**: Difficulty shifting thinking and adapting to changing demands
- **Planning**: Multi-step tasks feel overwhelming; organizing/sequencing future actions impaired

**...
end


NORM PracticalImplications:
    sutra: "Task design must account for BOTH impulsivity AND rigidity simultaneously"
    gloss:
        Task design must account for BOTH impulsivity AND rigidity simultaneously. This seeming contradiction requires:

1. **Clear structure** (accommodates autistic need for predictability)
2. **Built-in flexibility** (accommodates ADHD need for variety)
3. **Explicit transition support** (neither profile...
end


TERM Definition:
    sutra: ""I am smart, I know exactly what to do, but I cannot make my brain and body do it."  This gap bet..."
    gloss:
        *"I am smart, I know exactly what to do, but I cannot make my brain and body do it."*

This gap between intellectual capacity and functional output is central to AuDHD experience. Intelligence often masks executive dysfunction, creating unrealistic expectations.
end


TERM TheSpikyCognitiveProfile:

    gloss:
        AuDHD individuals show significant discrepancies between domains:

| Domain | Typical Performance |
|--------|-------------------|
| Verbal Reasoning | Within normal range |
| Nonverbal Reasoning | Within normal range |
| Processing Speed | ~1 standard deviation below mean |
| Working Memory | Moder...
end


TERM CompensationStrategies:
    sutra: "1"
    gloss:
        1. **Externalize Everything**: Move working memory burden to external systems (notes, calendars, visual reminders, written instructions)
2. **Reduce Load**: Break complex tasks into single-step units—one action per instruction
3. **Prime Context**: Use environmental cues to trigger next actions rath...
end


TERM TheSensorySeesaw:

    gloss:
        AuDHD involves paradoxical co-existence of opposing sensory needs:

**Hypersensitivity (Sensory Avoidance)**
- Low sensory threshold
- Bright lights, loud noises, textures experienced as painful
- Motivation: protect from sensory overload

**Hyposensitivity (Sensory Seeking)**
- High sensory thresho...
end


TERM PracticalApplications:
    sutra: "Create environments accommodating BOTH needs: - Weighted blanket + noise-canceling headphones = p..."
    gloss:
        Create environments accommodating BOTH needs:
- Weighted blanket + noise-canceling headphones = pressure input without auditory overload
- Bass-heavy music through headphones = controlled stimulation for focus
- Texture-neutral clothing + proprioceptive tools = comfort without understimulation
end


TERM InteroceptionDeficits:
    sutra: "Difficulty perceiving internal body states creates systematic blind spots: - Hunger not registere..."
    gloss:
        Difficulty perceiving internal body states creates systematic blind spots:
- Hunger not registered until weakness/dizziness
- Thirst not registered until severe dehydration
- Full bladder becomes emergency
- Emotions not registered until overwhelming intensity

**Protocol**: Proactive scheduling of...
end


TERM TheBrokenFuelGaugeModel:
    sutra: "Two factors combine catastrophically:  1"
    gloss:
        Two factors combine catastrophically:

1. **Hyper-vigilant neuroception**: Nervous system constantly scanning for threats, consuming resources invisibly
2. **Poor interoception**: Unable to sense resource depletion until crisis

Result: Body runs marathon at sprint pace while mind remains unaware of...
end


TERM TheCompetencyTrap:
    sutra: "Highly practiced masking + ADHD bursts of hyper-productivity = illusion of high competence"
    gloss:
        Highly practiced masking + ADHD bursts of hyper-productivity = illusion of high competence.

This sets unsustainable expectations—from self and others. When inevitable burnout occurs, it appears as personal failure rather than predictable outcome of prolonged overexertion.
end


TERM EnergyManagementPrinciples:
    sutra: "1"
    gloss:
        1. **Assume Lower Baseline**: Plan capacity at 60% of apparent capability
2. **Build Recovery Into Schedule**: Not as reward for productivity, but as necessary maintenance
3. **Monitor External Signals**: Use observable indicators (irritability, mistake rate, physical tension) since internal signals...
end


TERM NeurologicalBasis:
    sutra: "Extreme, intensely painful emotional response to perception of rejection, criticism, or failure"
    gloss:
        Extreme, intensely painful emotional response to *perception* of rejection, criticism, or failure. Not simply dislike—described as unbearable. Physical pain metaphors are literal, not figurative.
end


TERM Manifestations:
    sutra: "- Sudden outburst of anger/rage - Immediate flood of tears - Rapid descent mimicking major depres..."
    gloss:
        - Sudden outburst of anger/rage
- Immediate flood of tears
- Rapid descent mimicking major depressive episode
- Often misdiagnosed as rapid-cycling mood disorder
end


TERM CopingPatterns:
    sutra: "Pattern 1: People-Pleasing/Perfectionism - Hyper-vigilance to others' expectations - Striving to ..."
    gloss:
        **Pattern 1: People-Pleasing/Perfectionism**
- Hyper-vigilance to others' expectations
- Striving to be above reproach
- Presenting "false self" tailored to perceived desires

**Pattern 2: Risk Avoidance**
- Stop trying new things
- Avoid situations with possible judgment
- Leads to underachievement...
end


TERM RSDandMasking:
    sutra: "RSD is primary engine driving masking maintenance"
    gloss:
        RSD is primary engine driving masking maintenance. Masking defends against neurologically unbearable social pain. Unmasking feels terrifying because it exposes self to profound emotional wound.

Recognition: The fear is real. The pain is real. Accommodation requires acknowledging this reality, not d...
end


TERM TheLayeredPerformance:
    sutra: "AuDHD individuals engage in double-mask, simultaneously concealing traits from both neurotypes:  ..."
    gloss:
        AuDHD individuals engage in double-mask, simultaneously concealing traits from both neurotypes:

**Example**: Using memorized script (masking autistic trait) WHILE exerting energy to prevent interrupting (masking ADHD trait)

Each mask requires cognitive resources. The combination is exponentially—n...
end


TERM LongTermConsequences:
    sutra: "- Primary driver of exhaustion and burnout - Linked to severe anxiety, depression - Profound loss..."
    gloss:
        - Primary driver of exhaustion and burnout
- Linked to severe anxiety, depression
- Profound loss of personal identity
- Heightened risk of suicidal ideation
- Delays accurate diagnosis (struggles invisible to clinicians)
end


TERM TheCompetencyTrapRevisited:
    sutra: "Double-masking creates external competence that is fundamentally unsustainable"
    gloss:
        Double-masking creates external competence that is fundamentally unsustainable. Performance drops are shocking to observers and self—internalized as failure rather than predictable exhaustion.

**Protocol**: Create mask-optional contexts. Identify safe spaces where double-masking is not required. Bu...
end


TERM NeurobiologicalBasis:
    sutra: "Innate disposition rooted in ADHD neurobiology: - Interest-driven nervous system hyperfocuses on ..."
    gloss:
        Innate disposition rooted in ADHD neurobiology:
- Interest-driven nervous system hyperfocuses on meaningful concepts
- Heightened amygdala reactivity amplifies feelings of injustice
- Rumination causes getting "stuck" on inequity
end


TERM FourDomains:
    sutra: "1"
    gloss:
        1. **Victim Sensitivity**: Distress when personally treated unfairly
2. **Observer Sensitivity**: Distress witnessing mistreatment of others
3. **Beneficiary Sensitivity**: Guilt when benefiting from unfair advantage
4. **Perpetrator Sensitivity**: Intense guilt when causing harm (even unintentional...
end

    gloss:
        - Can fuel powerful dedication to advocacy and social change
- Can become significant source of emotional burnout
- Feels weight of world's problems at physiological level

**Protocol**: Channel justice sensitivity into bounded, effective action. Infinite engagement with injustice depletes without r...
end


TERM DualRegulatoryFunction:
    sutra: "When Overstimulated (Autistic Need) - Stimming soothes and grounds - Rhythmic, predictable sensor..."
    gloss:
        **When Overstimulated (Autistic Need)**
- Stimming soothes and grounds
- Rhythmic, predictable sensory input blocks overwhelming external stimuli

**When Understimulated (ADHD Need)**
- Fidgeting provides input for focus and alertness
- Discharges excess energy
end


TERM CommonStims:
    sutra: "- Rocking, hand-flapping, spinning, tapping, vocalizing - Fidgeting with objects - Rhythmic movem..."
    gloss:
        - Rocking, hand-flapping, spinning, tapping, vocalizing
- Fidgeting with objects
- Rhythmic movements
- Skin-picking, hair-twisting (potentially harmful—redirect, don't suppress)
end


TERM PracticalAccommodation:
    sutra: "- Allow stimming in work/focus contexts—it enables function - Provide acceptable alternatives (fi..."
    gloss:
        - Allow stimming in work/focus contexts—it enables function
- Provide acceptable alternatives (fidget tools, movement breaks)
- Recognize stimming as functional, not pathological
- Suppressed stimming increases cognitive load and reduces available resources

TERM SevenPulsesAdaptation:
    sutra: "Reference CANON-35120 for tier-down protocols"
    gloss:
        Reference CANON-35120 for tier-down protocols. This satellite adds:

- **Cognitive tracking**: The Knowing-Doing Gap means pulse awareness may not translate to action. Build external triggers.
- **Sensory-aware pulse selection**: Overstimulated states require low-sensory pulse options. Understimulat...
end


TERM DailyPracticeConsiderations:
    sutra: "1"
    gloss:
        1. **Morning**: Schedule eating/drinking before relying on hunger signals
2. **Transitions**: Budget extra time and energy for context switches
3. **Afternoon**: Monitor external exhaustion indicators (not internal sense)
4. **Evening**: Create mask-optional recovery space
5. **Throughout**: Allow s...
end


TERM CrisisProtocolAddition:
    sutra: "When RSD triggers: 1"
    gloss:
        When RSD triggers:
1. Name it: "This is RSD, not objective reality"
2. Do not make decisions in acute state
3. Wait minimum 90 minutes before evaluating
4. Seek external perspective if available

TERM Summary:
    sutra: "The AuDHD phenotype requires protocols that honor paradox: structure AND flexibility, stimulation..."
    gloss:
        The AuDHD phenotype requires protocols that honor paradox: structure AND flexibility, stimulation AND protection, connection AND solitude. Generic advice fails because it addresses one pole while ignoring its opposite.

Effective accommodation requires:
- Externalizing cognitive load
- Scheduling bo...
