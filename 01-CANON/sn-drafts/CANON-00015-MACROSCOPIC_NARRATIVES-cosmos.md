    sutra: "The Macroscopic Narratives are not passive taxonomies but active interpretive filters"
    gloss:
        The Macroscopic Narratives are not passive taxonomies but **active interpretive filters**. Every piece of external content processed through Ψ is evaluated against these lenses to determine:

    gloss:
        Post-1970s divergence of productivity and wages, decline in labor's share of GDP, and concentration of wealth.

    sutra: "Systemic mis-, dis-, and mal-information combined with synthetic media pressure institutions"
    gloss:
        Systemic mis-, dis-, and mal-information combined with synthetic media pressure institutions. Misinformation scales effortlessly while trust in institutions evaporates. This creates environment where solutions exist but inability to agree on problem nature prevents implementation.
