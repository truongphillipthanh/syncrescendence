TERM THEROOTS:
    sutra: "Syncrescendence did not emerge from nothing"

    gloss:
        **Clark & Chalmers | 1998**

The extended mind thesis holds that mind "does not exclusively reside in the brain or even the body, but extends into the physical world" via tools and environment.

    gloss:
        **Douglas Hofstadter | Gödel, Escher, Bach (1979) + I Am a Strange Loop (2007)**

Hofstadter's concept of "strange loops" illuminates consciousness: it emerges as recursive process where the brain models itself within the world. Self-reference creates the "I" that seems to observe from nowhere.

        **John Vervaeke | Awakening from the Meaning Crisis (2019)**

    gloss:
        **Robert Kegan | The Evolving Self (1982) + In Over Our Heads (1994)**

Kegan maps adult cognitive development through subject-object transitions. What we were subject TO (embedded in, unable to see) becomes object OF (visible, manipulable, transcendable). Development continues beyond adolescence....

    gloss:
        **Donella Meadows | Thinking in Systems (2008) + Peter Senge | The Fifth Discipline (1990)**

        What distinguishes Ψ from its tributaries?

TERM TheLimitation:
    sutra: "Every synthesis is partial"
    gloss:
        Every synthesis is partial. Every framework reflects its creator's blindspots. Every architecture contains what its architect could see and misses what remained invisible.

Ψ will be transcended. It should be transcended. The Annual Dissolution Ceremony encodes this recognition architecturally. What...
