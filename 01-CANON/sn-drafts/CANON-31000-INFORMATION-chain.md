TERM STAGE1PATTERNRECOGNITION:
    sutra: "Nature: Basic structure detection, signal awareness emergence"
    gloss:
        **Nature**: Basic structure detection, signal awareness emergence.

**Key Markers**:
- Identifies recurring patterns in daily experience
- Detects obvious signals in information environment
- Recognizes when attention captured versus directed
- Demonstrates platform literacy (navigates major platfor...
end


TERM STAGE2SIGNALEXTRACTION:
    sutra: "Nature: Noise filtering, salience identification, sophisticated attention"
    gloss:
        **Nature**: Noise filtering, salience identification, sophisticated attention.

**Key Markers**:
- Consistently distinguishes signal from noise
- Identifies high-value information sources
- Manages attention allocation strategically
- Develops platform presence generating engagement

**Practices**:...
end


TERM STAGE3INTUITIVEDISCRIMINATION:
    sutra: "Nature: Pre-cognitive knowing, felt-sense accuracy, aesthetic intelligence"
    gloss:
        **Nature**: Pre-cognitive knowing, felt-sense accuracy, aesthetic intelligence.

**Key Markers**:
- Reliable intuitive signal detection (verified by outcomes)
- Aesthetic intelligence operational (knows quality immediately)
- Multi-modal perception integrated (visual/textual/social)
- Teaches others...
end


TERM STAGE4EMBODIEDKNOWING:
    sutra: "Nature: Transparent awareness, effortless perception, wisdom-informed sensing"
    gloss:
        **Nature**: Transparent awareness, effortless perception, wisdom-informed sensing.

**Key Markers**:
- Perception operates automatically without conscious effort
- Novel signal recognition without prior training
- Wisdom integration (knows what matters without analysis)
- Second-generation practitio...
end


TERM SYNCHRONIZATIONGUIDANCE:
    sutra: "Imbalance Indicators: - Sensing >2 stages ahead of Embodiment: Theoretical perception without gro..."
    gloss:
        **Imbalance Indicators**:
- Sensing >2 stages ahead of Embodiment: Theoretical perception without grounding
- Sensing >2 stages behind Coherence: Signals without interpretive frameworks
- Sensing >2 stages behind Efficacy: Perception without strategic application

**Healthy Progression**:
- Sensing...

TERM MEASUREMENTPROTOCOL:
    sutra: "Monthly Assessment: 1"
    gloss:
        **Monthly Assessment**:
1. Which stage am I honestly at? (Evidence-based, not aspirational)
2. What specific advancement criteria have I met?
3. What practices serve current stage development?
4. Is synchronization with other chains maintained?

**Quarterly Review**:
- Stage progression evaluation
-...
end


TERM CONCLUSION:
