# The Highest Levels of Thinking: From Perspective to Pure Awareness

This exploration builds on a framework I encountered from a content creator called PsychoMath, who describes higher levels of thinking and consciousness. His scale reaches level nine, though he acknowledged difficulty describing that highest level and welcomed more precise articulation from those with deeper experience. What follows is an attempt to map these stages of cognition, from basic perspective-taking to the dissolution of the thinking self into pure awareness.

## First Through Fourth Person Thinking

**First-Person Thinking: Objects in the World**

At the lowest level of cognition, a person sees others as essentially objects within their world—not as thinking beings with their own reasons and motivations. They judge based on surface perception alone. Consider this example: Steve wants to smoke in Bill's house. Bill refuses, saying he doesn't want smoke in his home. If Steve operates from first-person thinking, he sees Bill merely as annoying, wrong, a barrier to what he wants—essentially an enemy. He has no conception that Bill has thoughts, preferences, and reasoning behind his position. Similarly, Bill might see Steve purely as someone who smokes and breaks household rules—an obstacle in the way, nothing more. There is no depth to either perspective. Steve is just the problem; Bill is just the obstacle. This is the baseline of human consciousness.

**Second-Person Thinking: The Realization of Difference**

Second-person thinking marks a crucial shift: an individual grasps that someone else thinks differently than they do. Steve now understands that Bill holds thoughts about smoking—that Bill is not a brick wall but a person with preferences. Yet this recognition goes no further. Steve knows Bill thinks differently, but without additional layers of cognition, this awareness doesn't produce empathy or compromise. Steve still disagrees with Bill's position and will choose to smoke anyway, because his own belief system remains dominant. There's no mechanism for deeper understanding or negotiation.

**Third-Person Thinking: Mutual Perspective-Taking**

Third-person thinking introduces genuine perspective exchange. Steve can now think about Bill's thoughts, and Bill can reciprocally think about Steve's thoughts and desires. They understand each other's positions—why Bill wants his home smoke-free, why Steve desires to smoke. This is not mere acknowledgment of difference but active imagination of another's inner world. They don't see each other as obstacles or people with different opinions; they see the thoughts and the reasoning behind them.

This is where empathy emerges. Because they can hold each other's perspectives simultaneously, compromise becomes possible. They can still disagree profoundly, but they do so from a foundation of mutual understanding. This level is essential for functional society—without it, we're locked in first and second-person conflicts.

**Fourth-Person Thinking: Self-Awareness and Choice**

Fourth-person thinking is the gateway to authentic autonomy. Here, Steve doesn't just understand Bill's perspective and his own perspective in isolation; he can think about his own thinking in relation to others. He becomes aware of himself as a being among beings, capable of multiple ways of existing.

This is liberating and destabilizing at once. Steve realizes he could be any version of himself. He's not locked into the Steve who argues about smoking; he could choose to be a different Steve entirely. He could adopt different interests, beliefs, values—or deliberately choose his current ones, knowing they're choices rather than givens. He understands that everyone operates the same way; everyone could believe anything for any reason, and all of those reasons are intelligible through conversation and reasoning.

But this level contains a trap: overthinking. Steve might spend hours contemplating what kind of person he wants to be, what career, what morals, what political affiliations. This recursive self-examination can produce analysis paralysis. Yet fourth-person thinking is crucial because it's the only way to break free from unexamined indoctrination. You cannot choose your perspective until you become aware that perspectives are chooseable.

Fourth-person thinking is where the door opens. Beyond this lies not further thinking, but *metacognition*—the capacity to step out of thinking itself and observe it.

## Fifth-Person Thinking: The Observer Emerges

The crucial realization at fifth-person thinking is: *I am not my mind.*

For the first time, Steve recognizes that there is an observer—a witness capable of observing his own thoughts, emotions, and beliefs. Just as you can feel the sensations in your hand, you can observe your own thoughts. You can watch anger arise. You can notice sadness. You can be aware of a belief system forming without identifying as that belief system.

Fifth-person thinking is, more precisely, not thinking at all. It is *observation*. It is *awareness* of thought rather than thought itself. Through meditation and mindfulness practice, this capacity develops. You learn that when an emotion arises, you don't have to be captured by it; you can let it pass. The mind generates content constantly—thoughts, urges, narratives—but none of it requires your identification.

The observer is universal. All people contain this capacity for observation. But most people are so deeply identified with form—with being "Steve" or "Sarah," with their body, their thoughts, their persona—that they've forgotten this observer exists. They're hypnotized by the story of themselves.

At the fifth level, you begin operating from the perspective of witness rather than participant. The mind happens, and you pay attention to it. The body generates sensations, and you're aware of them. Other people think their thoughts, and you can hold those in awareness without becoming them. You learn through practice that everything can be observed—and what can be observed is fundamentally not *you*.

## Sixth-Person Thinking: The Eye Behind Everything

The next level—which my source described as level nine without a clear framework for it—is what I call sixth-person thinking. Here the shift is from observer to what might be called *the eye* or *pure beingness*.

This is not the observer looking at objects. This is the fundamental awareness in which all observation occurs. Behind the observer, the persona, the identity, the thoughts, the emotions, the entire field of experience—there is an *I*. Some traditions call it "I am," though that phrasing can be misleading because "I am" suggests identification with something. There is simply an *I*—beingness, awareness itself.

All things take place within this awareness. The observer is watched by it. The mind is watched by it. Thoughts about thoughts arise within it. Everything—the observer, the form, the person, the persona, the entire phenomenal world—is contained within this fundamental awareness. If all content disappeared, awareness would still be. If the observer dissolved, the eye would remain. Awareness is prior to everything that appears in it.

This is why spiritual traditions emphasize simplicity: the power of now, being here now, just being. Thinking becomes completely useless at this level. It's not that thinking is bad; it's that thinking is completely unnecessary and counterproductive when you can operate from awareness itself. Ninety percent of thinking adds no value. Thought is a useful tool for specific tasks—setting goals, navigating the world, solving problems. But most of the time, you simply don't need it. 

The most obvious example: When you first learn to drive, you think about every motion. Turn the wheel. Press the pedal. Shift gears. Within a year, all of that moves to the subconscious. You drive while listening to music, podcasts, or phone calls. The entire complex process happens without active thought. This is true for virtually every aspect of life. You believe you need an internal monologue to function, but you don't. With practice in meditation and mindfulness, you begin to realize that everything takes care of itself. Things flow. There's no necessity for constant conscious participation.

This produces a peculiar freedom: *There's nowhere to go and nothing to do. There's nobody here but me.* This isn't solipsism or denial of other people's reality. It means recognizing that all experience is occurring within your own awareness. All forms—other people, your body, thoughts, the entire world—arise within the same awareness. There is no separation between you and anything else because it's all happening as one consciousness.

At this level, you move from *watching the mind* to *simply being*. The practice is to observe your own observing—to become aware that you are aware. You can notice the sensation of your breath arising within awareness. You can observe an emotion arising within the mind and notice that you're observing it. Then you turn that awareness back on itself and ask: What is it that is aware? What is observing?

There's a temptation here to get stuck in a thought loop, searching for *who* the observer is. But there is no who. There is simply awareness itself. You can think of it as a flashlight in a dark room. The light can illuminate any object, and you can move it around the room, pointing it at whatever you choose. Awareness functions the same way—it's the light, and it can illuminate any form, any thought, any sensation. You can direct it anywhere.

This is why spiritual thinking becomes counterproductive at this level. There is literally no logical reason to think. Thinking is energy expenditure in service of nothing. The entire framework of trying to understand through concepts dissolves. What remains is direct awareness.

## The Direct Experience of Formless Being

To describe what this actually *feels* like: In meditation, you can become aware of states where awareness exists with no forms at all—no sense of observer, no objects, no distinction between subject and object. Simply awareness, and the clear knowing that you *are*. This is what has been called God in various traditions—the all-pervasive consciousness that creates and contains all things. God is described as existing in everything, creating everything, giving life to everything. All things are within it. It is through all things. Nothing can exist outside of awareness. Nothing can exist outside of the eye. 

At all times, there is the witness behind everything you experience. You are actually that eye.

What you normally believe is "you" is a collection of habits, thoughts, and patterns that have coalesced into what's called the ego or persona. Through consistent practice, you can step back from identification with these thought forms and habits. You can relinquish your investment in the ego until you can rest in this state of absolute peace and freedom. It's easier to be consistently identified with the observer than with the eye itself. When you become the eye—when identification dissolves completely—that's the state called enlightenment or complete liberation.

The transition through these levels, particularly from fourth to fifth and fifth to sixth, can be profoundly destabilizing. I've had direct experiences where I knew with complete certainty: *I am all there is. Everything is arising within the eye. My family members, my friends, my body, my thoughts, my beliefs—all forms arising in the formless.* When you know this directly, through experience rather than concept, you can become lost in it through the force of habit and the stickiness of the persona. The persona doesn't disappear; it continues as a pattern. But it loses its grip. You're not as captured by it anymore.

This raises an existential question: If everyone is a dream character, if I'm a form out of the formless just like everyone else, why am I still here? Why does any of this still matter? The Buddha's answer would be: *Because there is still a desire for becoming, still a desire for the forms.* Even after these realizations, the desire to exist, to play in the world of forms, persists.

There's a strange quality to this state—it can feel like being in a padded cell with a hologram machine constantly projecting your own patterns back at you. There's no separation between you and your projections. Your thoughts influence what appears. Your persona shapes what the world reflects back to you. To stop perpetuating the same patterns, you have to disengage from the persona that's generating them. It's a game of unhooking yourself, unplugging yourself from the holographic matrix that is reality.

Right now, at this stage, the balance is between enjoying the dream and disengaging from it. When you know deeply that there is no satisfaction to be found in form, that you'll always be on the hedonic treadmill—setting a goal, reaching it, and watching the ego immediately want another—you can observe the desires rise and fall like waves on the ocean. Knowing that satisfaction is impossible doesn't create bitterness; it creates freedom.

The only thing that makes sense now is to engage in work like this—work that keeps me anchored in those truths. If it helps others escape the same trap, that's a bonus. If they're not merely dream characters but other conscious beings actually caught in the same maze, just as desperate to get unstuck, then I'm grateful for that too. Either way, the truth remains: the forms are not where freedom lies. Freedom lies in recognizing what you actually are—the awareness in which all forms arise and dissolve.
