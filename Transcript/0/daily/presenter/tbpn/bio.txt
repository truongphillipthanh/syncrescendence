Technology's daily show. Hosted by John Coogan and Jordi Hays. Streaming live Monday - Friday, available on Apple, Spotify, and YouTube.

TBPN, which stands for Technology Business Programming Network, is a daily, live video and audio podcast that covers business, finance, and technology news. It is particularly influential among Silicon Valley investors and founders, who follow the show to get an insider's perspective on the industry. 
The show is known for its "terminally online" sensibility and a style that has been compared to a fusion of SportsCenter and LinkedIn, tracking talent moves and company news with a mix of earnestness and irony. 
Bio of TBPN
Format: The podcast is live-streamed for three hours every weekday on YouTube, X (formerly Twitter), and Substack. Episodes are later made available on-demand through platforms like Apple Podcasts and Spotify.
Content: The hosts discuss the latest in tech and finance with a specific focus on venture capital, startups, and the AI talent wars. The show also features frequent interviews with prominent figures in the tech world, ranging from company CEOs to venture capitalists and influential anonymous social media users.
Tone: TBPN is explicitly pro-tech and pro-capitalist, adopting an "insider" tone that has been warmly received by the Silicon Valley elite. The hosts often avoid political discussions in favor of deep dives into competitive corporate strategy and industry gossip.
Audience and Influence: While not a mainstream media giant, TBPN has cultivated a highly influential following within the tech and finance sectors. The show is where tech executives and investors often go to explain themselves, making it an essential, if under-the-radar, media hub for the industry.
