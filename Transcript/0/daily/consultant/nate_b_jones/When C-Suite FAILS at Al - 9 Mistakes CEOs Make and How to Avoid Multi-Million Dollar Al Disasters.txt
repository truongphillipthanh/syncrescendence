When C-Suite FAILS at AI: 9 Mistakes CEOs Make and How to Avoid Multi-Million Dollar AI Disasters
2,541 views  Oct 26, 2025  SEATTLE
What are the real drivers behind AI adoption failures? Beyond the headlines, what makes an AI adoption fall apart?

The common story is that AI fails because “the tech isn’t ready.” The reality is that most failures start with people, structure, and intent.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on how organizations get stuck—and how to fix it:
• Why integration and governance collapse even with working AI code
• How the review bottleneck and intern problem hide in plain sight
• What premature scaling and automation traps reveal about leadership bias
• Where existential paralysis and training deficits stall real AI strategy

AI success isn’t about hype cycles—it’s about design discipline and operational intent. The teams that win treat coordination and data as seriously as models and code.

Understanding AI Adoption Failures
0:00
It seems like AI adoption fails more
0:02
often than it goes right. I want to take
0:04
today's video and talk specifically
0:06
about the nine different AI failure
0:09
patterns that I've seen in organizations
0:11
over the last few months in 2025. I want
0:14
to get at not just what happened, but
0:16
what is the root cause? What are the
0:18
things that make that pattern sticky,
0:20
that fail pattern sticky, and then what
0:22
is the actual fix that unsticks an
0:24
organization and gets it back on track.
0:26
I don't think we talk enough about the
0:28
categories of AI adoption failure and I
0:31
want to lay them out really cleanly so
0:32
that we have a vocabulary to talk about
0:34
them to address them and ultimately to
0:36
get back on track. Let's start with
0:38
number one, the integration tarpet.
0:41
Let's say engineering ships working AI
0:43
code in weeks, but sales and legal and
0:46
compliance cycles were never meant to
0:48
run that fast. They stretch into months
0:50
or longer. Cross team stakeholder
0:52
meetings are multiplying all over the
0:54
business talking about policies and
0:56
approvals. The root cause here is that
0:59
the organization's budget for AI
1:01
development was structured in terms of
1:03
dollars and cents and not in terms of
1:06
coordination cost. When you are working
1:08
with a prototype, it's very simple. But
1:11
a prototype does not equal a system that
1:15
fits data architecture, compliance, and
1:17
politics together. Yes, organizational
1:20
politics are relevant. So why is this
1:23
sticky? Everyone assumes if it works
1:25
technically then deployment is going to
1:28
be easy but integration complexity
1:30
becomes visible only after the build is
1:32
is complete right you can see it working
1:35
you can see that deployment is easy
1:37
executives tend to not understand why
1:39
it's not being used why we're stuck on
1:42
paper the committees will make sense the
1:44
IT policy will make sense and none of it
1:47
actually delivers value the fix is
1:49
pretty simple take approval paths take
1:52
policy paths as critically as you take
1:55
writing code. You want to fix and
1:57
pre-wire in how you are fasttracking
2:00
adoption through the organization before
2:03
you jump in and start just saying we can
2:06
ship this thing quickly. Treat the human
2:09
problem as significant as the code
2:11
problem. you want to assign someone,
2:14
maybe it's a deployment PM whose entire
2:17
job separate from the engineering piece
2:19
is just to say, do we have all of our
2:23
ducks in a row process-wise to actually
2:24
get this into people's hands? Do we have
2:26
data support and approval? Do we have
2:28
legal clearance? Do we have any concerns
2:31
around compliance we need to address? Do
2:34
we have any concerns from HR that we
2:36
need to address? They're not asking,
2:38
does the model work? That needs to be
2:40
somebody else's job. All they're trying
2:41
to do is to wrangle the stakeholders and
2:44
move them quickly along. You have to
2:46
budget for the organizational side to
2:48
get out of the integration tarpet. There
2:50
is no shortcut. Failure number two,
2:54
governance vacuum. Let's say red teams
Governance and Security Challenges
2:57
find vulnerabilities. We actually had
2:59
that happen this week with teams finding
3:01
vulnerabilities in AI powered browsers.
3:03
Security will flag an unapproved
3:06
architecture when a red team
3:07
vulnerability is found, but there's no
3:09
owner for what happens if AI does
3:12
something. And so in this situation, if
3:14
your ordinary red team, your ordinary
3:16
security issues are triggered by AI, you
3:20
often run into a governance issue.
3:22
Really, there's no one who's a directly
3:24
responsible individual who treats AI
3:26
governance as a first class object. And
3:28
that is your core problem. That is why
3:31
when small vulnerabilities are sometimes
3:33
found in your agentic systems, you get
3:35
stuck. When they're found in your
3:37
implementation of a custom chat GPT, you
3:40
get stuck. You have to treat governance
3:43
as a first class object. And that is
3:45
especially true if you are in a high
3:47
compliance industry. And here's the
3:49
trick. You probably knew that if you
3:52
were in high compliance. But what you
3:53
may not have realized is that the skill
3:55
set for governance and AI is different
3:58
from the skill set for a lot of typical
4:01
IT security projects. And that is why
4:03
this problem is sticky because people
4:06
often try and address it by saying let's
4:08
give it a security review. Let's give it
4:10
a software review. That feels like
4:12
bureaucratic slowdown. It looks like
4:14
bureaucratic slowdown. The teams that
4:16
are addressing it don't have the tools
4:17
to do it right. So teams just kind of go
4:20
hands off and one incident ends up
4:22
freezing everything. A governance vacuum
4:25
ends up grinding your system to a halt.
4:27
The fix is simple. You need to embed the
4:30
right talent with the right tools to
4:33
make security a day zero problem. That
4:36
means that you have to think about what
4:38
the AI agent can access, what it does,
4:41
what its blast radius is, what failure
4:43
modes look like, how you architect
4:45
security rather than making security the
4:47
agents problem with decisioning, how you
4:50
can reliably evaluate whether the agent
4:52
is doing the right thing, how you test
4:55
in production systems a range of
4:58
utterances or words from the user that
5:01
let you know that if there are things
5:03
the system should not be responding to,
5:05
prompt injection attacks, etc. You can
5:08
prove that you're addressing them
5:10
correctly at the desired rate of
5:12
success. If you don't make all of that
5:14
somebody's problem, and it is again not
5:16
a traditional security software purview.
5:19
It's a new set of skills, you're going
5:20
to be in trouble. Failure number three,
5:22
the review bottleneck. AI will generate
Bottlenecks in Review Processes
5:25
output so fast. I've talked about this
5:26
before, but human review doesn't get
5:28
shorter just because AI gets longer. And
5:30
so output quality starts to vary super
5:34
wildly. and engineers or other job
5:37
families end up babysitting AI systems.
5:39
The root cause here is that you have
5:41
stuck AI as an engine onto the wrong
5:43
part of your workflow, generation
5:46
instead of judgment. So, organizations
5:48
will usually measure success by how much
5:50
you can produce. And so, the instinct is
5:53
to just stick a bolt-on engine of AI
5:55
generation onto the generative part of
5:57
your process. Maybe it's making social
5:59
media stuff. Maybe it's writing
6:01
documents or breaking out tickets. Maybe
6:03
it's writing code for code reviews. We
6:06
think how much it can produce matters.
6:07
It's sticky because impressive demos
6:10
look so good when they show speed of
6:12
generation. And a lot of people are
6:14
stuck in the mindset that that is the
6:16
KPI that matters and review burden is
6:19
hidden. You don't see review burden in a
6:21
demo. You need to design systems that
6:24
are human in the loop from the start.
6:26
I've said this before. Your best humans
6:28
should feel more fingertippy on your
6:31
work because of AI, not not fighting AI.
6:35
So AI should be able to draft useful
6:37
pieces of work, whether that's code or
6:39
something else. And a human should have
6:42
comfortable capacity to review that
6:45
work. That means being clear about what
6:47
your AI scope actually is, what the
6:51
scope of your AI assistant for this task
6:53
actually is. And it means getting
6:56
serious about how much of a review
6:59
burden your AI system imposes. If you
7:02
have someone and all they're doing is
7:05
just hitting merge on AI generated poll
7:08
requests on your codebase, you are
7:10
extending vulnerability into your system
7:13
because you refused to think about the
7:15
review bottleneck. And there are real
7:17
security implications and yes, systems
7:19
really do that. Please, please, please
7:22
take the time to look at whether you are
7:25
architecting your system for review and
7:27
for putting expert humans in touch with
7:29
the work or not. Number four, the
7:32
unreliable intern. Let's say AI handles
7:35
80% of a task perfectly and it fails
Assessing AI Suitability for Tasks
7:38
catastrophically on the last 20%. And
7:41
you can't predict when failures are
7:43
going to occur. Supervision costs may
7:45
approach the cost of just doing the work
7:46
at that point. The root cause here is
7:49
that AI lacks judgment and memory and
7:51
context for what you need specifically
7:54
and organizations keep trying to deploy
7:57
AI on tasks that aren't AI ready yet as
8:00
a result. Part of the risk here, part of
8:02
why this stays sticky, is that the 80%
8:05
success rate in this situation, which is
8:07
like real, it feels close enough to keep
8:10
trying. Teams assume just one more tweak
8:13
is going to fix that issue. But the real
8:15
fix is actually simple. You
8:17
intentionally audit the task for intern
8:21
suitability before you decide if it's AI
8:23
ready. In other words, you ask yourself,
8:25
would I give this to a smart but
8:27
forgetful intern who can't learn? If I
8:29
give them a clear task and clear context
8:32
and a clear and a clear structure for
8:35
the ask and output, could they do it?
8:37
Break complicated tasks into subtasks.
8:40
You want AI to do the retrieval and
8:42
formatting. You want AI to do these
8:45
sequential steps that are clear and you
8:47
want humans to be able to offer that
8:49
review as I said earlier. So be really
8:52
explicit when you're going through this
8:54
audit. I know this doesn't sound fun,
8:56
but part of the ask when you do AI
8:59
automation, well, when you are trying to
9:01
unstick adoption blockers, it's an ask
9:04
to extend organizational intent. You
9:07
have to be clear about your intention
9:09
for what tasks are suitable. And there
9:12
is no substitute for going into the
9:13
nitty-gritty and looking at those one by
Navigating Handoffs in AI Workflows
9:16
one. Failure number five is the handoff
9:18
tax. AI can handle one step in a
9:20
multi-step process. Handoffs between AI
9:23
and human are not fully worked out and
9:25
the system design and overall cycle time
9:28
barely improves. Sometimes it gets
9:30
worse. The root cause is you again you
9:32
automated the wrong part of your
9:33
workflow. You optimized for one
9:35
bottleneck and you created two new ones
9:37
on each side cuz you didn't think about
9:40
your on-ramps and off-ramps. This is
9:42
sticky because the per step improvement,
9:45
the KPIs are going to look great. Wow,
9:47
we took our per step for this drafting
9:49
stage down by 200%. Well, you have to
9:52
take full cycle time for workflows very
9:55
seriously or you are going to discover
9:58
how bad this is too late. The fix is
10:01
simple and again it comes down to
10:02
intent. You have to map the full
10:05
intended workflow before deploying AI.
10:08
Redesign it so AI can handle the
10:10
on-ramps and off-ramps of all the
10:12
components it needs to touch so that you
10:15
are not creating new bottlenecks at the
10:18
edges of AI systems. And then you want
10:21
to measure cycle time for the whole
10:22
process. If cycle time improvement is
10:25
not moving, you probably have an issue
10:27
with the edges of your AI system and how
10:30
it hands off to humans. And yes, that is
10:32
going to include training your humans in
10:34
new patterns of work. Number six, the
10:37
premature scale trap. Let's say you have
Scaling AI Solutions Effectively
10:39
a successful pilot and it's pushed
10:41
rapidly to companywide. You want to
10:43
double down on what's working. Edge
10:45
cases will immediately multiply. Support
10:48
costs are going to explode and quality
10:51
is going to degrade. You, it turns out,
10:53
were not ready for companywide roll out.
10:56
The root cause here is that you usually
10:58
have a much more controlled environment
11:00
for pilots with motivated users and very
11:04
clean data. This is almost a function of
11:06
the purpose of the pilot. You pick these
11:08
pilots because they're easier and people
11:10
magically forget that when they go to
11:12
roll out wide. The pilot team probably
11:14
understood AI limitations and worked
11:16
around them in a way the broader org
11:18
doesn't and can't. This is sticky
11:20
because leadership is just wired to seek
11:23
a quick win on AI and they want to
11:25
capture value fast and they're
11:26
optimizing and it feels like testing and
11:29
doing a gently scaled roll out is just
11:32
unnecessary delay and not moving quickly
11:34
in the age of AI. Well, I've got news.
11:37
Sometimes slow is smooth and smooth is
11:39
fast. The fix is honestly to document
11:43
what fundamental differences exist
11:46
between the pilot environment and the
11:48
real environment. So document all of the
11:50
workarounds that your pilot team used to
11:52
achieve the results. Those become
11:54
training. Document with skeptical users,
11:58
not with enthusiastic ones. How do they
12:00
use the tool? Research, understand, is
12:02
it working? Make sure that you try a
12:04
second pilot on a hard problem in the
12:07
messiest part of the organization. Does
12:08
that still work and deliver value? Then
12:11
start to dial up in stages, right? Maybe
12:13
you go to a 100 people and then 500
12:14
people before you hit 50,000. Right? You
12:17
want to build support infrastructure in
12:19
terms of people, learning and
12:21
development opportunities, giving very
12:24
very clear approval, disapproval, bug
12:26
reports, lots of feedback opportunities
12:29
for the software as you roll out. And
12:31
then you want to monitor, right? If you
12:33
get from five people or 25 people in a
12:35
pilot to 500 and your support tickets
12:38
are increasing per user, then you are
12:41
not ready to go farther. You have found
12:43
an edge case you need to resolve. take
12:45
the time to do it. There's no shortcuts.
Avoiding the Automation Trap
12:48
Number seven, automation trap. Let's say
12:50
AI speeds up existing processes. Great,
12:54
but it doesn't change outcomes. Activity
12:57
increases, results don't. You have you
12:59
have successfully automated
13:01
inefficiency. Congratulations. The root
13:03
cause here is you deployed AI before
13:07
asking whether the process should exist
13:09
at all. You automated approval workflows
13:11
that maybe shouldn't require approval.
13:13
Right? There's a lot of other examples
13:14
of this. This is sticky because we have
13:17
the mechanical horse fallacy. That's the
13:19
idea that a new technology should look
13:22
like the previous one in the way that a
13:24
car should look like a horse. No. I know
13:26
it's easier to automate what you're
13:28
already doing than to reimagine work.
13:30
But the value comes from reimagining
13:32
work. Before deploying, ask, should we
13:35
be doing this at all? And then you want
13:38
to look at outcomes that will stay
13:39
steady regardless of the process behind
13:42
them. Those are your north stars. So you
13:44
want to look at customer satisfaction.
13:46
You want to look at the efficiency with
13:48
which you can do a job in a way that is
13:50
steady regardless of the particular
13:53
technology used. And you want to look at
13:55
the perhaps business metrics that you
13:58
can drive given a piece of workflow
14:00
you'll automate. Whatever it is, make
14:02
sure that you prototype as close as
14:05
possible to a zero process version. Ask
14:08
yourself, what if AI dropped this
14:10
workflow? Would it work? You may not
14:12
find that it does. You may find you need
14:14
the workflow. N I can only take certain
14:16
pieces of it. That's a great answer. But
14:18
if you don't ask the question, you run
14:21
the risk of a mechanical horse. You run
14:23
the risk of an automation trap. And then
14:26
ask yourself how you'll know when it's
14:28
time to go the next step. That's sort of
14:29
how people start to really build value.
14:32
They look at these AI agent systems as
14:34
evolving. They look at this north star
14:36
of customer satisfaction or topline
14:38
revenue and they say AI can't drop this
14:40
process yet. It can do two parts out of
14:42
six. We are going to come back in a
14:45
quarter and see if we can get the whole
14:46
thing because AI is getting better.
14:48
Number eight, existential paralysis.
Overcoming Existential Paralysis in Leadership
14:50
Leadership is debating whether AI will
14:52
cannibalize the core business and you
14:54
get conflicting directives from senior
14:56
leaders. You have strateg strategy
14:58
discussions after strategy discussions
15:00
that loop without decisions. This
15:02
happens a little bit less often than
15:04
some of the others because I think the
15:06
FOMO and the bias for action are real in
15:08
this space. But fundamentally, I have
15:10
been in these rooms. I have seen people
15:12
worry about the risk of AI to the point
15:15
where they take no action. The root
15:17
cause is that AI's pace of change is
15:19
dramatically outstripping traditional
15:21
corporate strategic planning cycles. And
15:23
so, by the time you have built your
15:25
careful 5-year AI strategy that feels
15:28
steady, the landscape has shifted and
15:30
it's already outdated. That has happened
15:32
multiple times to organizations in the
15:34
last two years. It is part of the reason
15:36
why organizations are regretting
15:38
building custom models back in 2022
15:40
because now they've launched them in 23
15:42
24 and now they're regretting it because
15:44
the the cloud provided models are so
15:46
much better. Their AI strategy stayed
15:49
still because it was on a corporate
15:51
planning cycle and the market shifted.
15:53
Exist existential paralysis killed them.
15:55
And this is sticky because outcome
15:57
unpredictability makes every single
15:59
decision feel really high stakes. So
16:01
more analysis feels much safer than
16:04
making a bold commitment. Well, the fix
16:06
is simple. You can take if you're a
16:08
conservative organization, if you're not
16:10
ready to make a truly bold burn the
16:12
boats move, which is a way that startups
16:14
are addressing this and having great
16:15
success. I don't want to not call that
16:17
out. You can adopt a portfolio approach.
16:19
If you're feeling more conservative, you
16:21
can allocate your budget across
16:22
different horizons, a fast payoff mode,
16:24
a two to threeear bet mode, etc. And you
16:27
don't have to predict which ones wins.
16:29
You can diversify your bets. You can set
16:31
speed targets like getting to
16:33
complicated AI questions answered in
16:36
Slack within 90 days and getting to
16:40
truly agentic CRM automation for leads
16:43
in 8 months, right? Like you can have
16:45
different horizons in different bets and
16:47
measure them differently. You want to
16:49
also be clear in the portfolio bet world
16:52
that you can have learning investments
16:55
and scaling investments and that you
16:57
have clear gates to get to scale.
16:59
Essentially what I'm saying is if you
17:01
are not a burn the boats organization,
17:03
if you are a more cautious organization,
17:05
which is where this happens, then you
17:07
should be thinking about it as an
17:09
investment in a series of equities and
17:11
you don't know which one is going to be
17:13
a runaway success. But, you know,
17:15
failing to invest will certainly prevent
17:17
you from getting a runaway success. And
17:19
so, you need to balance your bets across
17:21
all of the different equities you've
17:23
got, watch their trajectories, and
17:25
double down where they're working. And
17:26
that requires a different
17:27
decision-making cycle from leadership.
17:29
And that is the only way I've seen that
17:32
these kinds of existential paralysis
17:34
organizations start to get themselves
17:36
together. Finally, number nine, the
17:38
training deficit and the data swamp. Two
17:40
sides of the same coin. You have low
17:42
adoption despite tool availability.
17:45
Users revert to old workflows. Do you
17:47
know why? Because AI can't access needed
Addressing Training and Data Issues
17:51
data and data quality issues only
17:53
surfaced after you deployed the tool.
17:55
The root cause here is that you deployed
17:57
the tool and taught people to use the
17:59
tool and never bothered to think about
18:01
the data issues that the tool was
18:03
surrounded by and it looked okay in
18:06
training. Data infrastructure work is
18:08
not fast. It doesn't ship in weeks. It's
18:10
typically boring. It's expensive. It's
18:12
slow. It's very difficult to fix data
18:14
problems and most organizations opt to
18:16
skip it if they can. This makes it
18:18
sticky because training is treated as
18:20
just one-time onboarding and you're not
18:22
really thinking about how you build the
18:24
capability to solve problems with data
18:28
using AI tools for your employees. So,
18:31
there's a mindset shift you have to have
18:33
along with a commitment to data
18:34
integrity. And so, you have to think
18:36
about how you're upshifting the data to
18:39
meet AI needs. and also how you're
18:42
upshifting training so your team can
18:44
take advantage of the AI tooling once
18:46
it's connected to data. I know AI
18:48
deployment is exciting and fast, but if
18:50
you deploy without paying attention to
18:52
the training and the data availability,
18:54
you're going to be in trouble. You
18:55
should allocate like I'm not kidding 3
18:58
to 6 months of expected training at
19:00
enterprise scale before you start to
19:02
think about ROI. You want to train on
19:04
workflows, not tools. So, you want to
19:07
ask, "How can I teach people to research
19:09
competitive intelligence using AI?" Not,
19:12
"How do you use chat GPT?" Here's a
19:14
handy twoline hack for a research
19:16
competitive intelligence prompt. It's a
19:18
deeper conversation. You can't assume
19:20
the tools will be the same over time.
19:22
So, you want to focus in your training
19:24
as you're starting to build people up,
19:26
focus on your AI champions, focus on the
19:28
ones who can teach their peers because
19:31
that is going to enable you to trigger
19:32
network effects that will enable AI
19:34
adoption to spread faster. On the data
19:37
side, you're going to need to do a full
19:39
data audit. You're going to need to
19:41
prioritize data access and you're going
19:43
to need to assign clear data ownership
19:46
so that someone is accountable for
19:48
making sure data is available for the
19:51
AI. What do we learn as we look across
19:54
all nine of these? I'll tell you the one
19:57
biggest takeaway that I have after
19:59
seeing all nine of these play out in
20:01
organizations over the last few months
20:02
is that AI adoption remains a
20:06
preventable problem. If you're having
20:08
issues with your AI adoption, it's on
20:10
you. Leadership is responsible for
20:13
establishing the kind of intentful,
20:15
thoughtful best practices that I'm
20:17
describing here that keep you out of
20:20
these failure modes. And when you run
20:22
into them, you got to be honest. You got
20:24
to say, "Here's the root cause. Here's
20:26
what's making it sticky. Here's what we
20:28
can do to get ourselves out of the
20:29
mess." That's why I made this video.
