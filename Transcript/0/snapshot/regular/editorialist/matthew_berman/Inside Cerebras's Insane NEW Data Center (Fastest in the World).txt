Inside Cerebras
0:55
I'm standing in front of Cerebrus' brand
0:57
new data center which they just did the
0:59
ribbon cutting for and now they are
1:00
serving 44 exaflops of new compute power
1:04
to their customers. It is the fastest AI
1:07
infrastructure on Earth and today we're
1:09
going to get a tour and we're going to
1:10
be able to speak to the CEO. This
1:12
facility delivers 44 exoflops of new
1:15
compute to customers, the fastest AI
1:18
infrastructure on Earth. Today, we're
1:21
going inside to see how Cerebras pushed
1:24
past the traditional chip limits and
1:26
built this behemoth from the ground up.
1:28
Starting with why they chose Oklahoma.
Location
1:31
Andrew, thanks for having us. We are
1:33
here at your new Oklahoma data center
1:36
for Cerebrris. Why did you choose
1:38
Oklahoma? There are a lot of reasons why
1:40
you you pick a location. You're looking
1:42
for a place with reasonable labor cost.
1:44
You're looking for a place you can
1:45
build, you can expand. You're looking
1:47
for a place with reasonably cost power.
1:49
And we found all of those here in
1:51
Oklahoma City.
1:52
Preparing for Oklahoma's weather shaped
1:54
the building itself. Reinforced concrete
1:56
designed with tornado resilience in
1:58
mind.
1:59
When you're choosing a location, do you
2:01
have to also think about the energy mix?
2:03
Do you have to think about how you're
2:05
going to secure the data center? I mean,
2:07
Oklahoma is known for tornadoes. What do
2:09
you How do you think about that?
2:11
Sure. I I I think generally you you
2:13
think about the construction of the
2:15
building and what it's rated for. That
2:18
hits you in your cost of insurance. Your
2:20
insurer will come out and look at the
2:21
building and be sure it's rated for
2:23
whatever natural disaster is in the
2:26
area. So, if you have a data center in
2:27
Santa Clara, California, which we do, uh
2:30
or Stockton, California, those are
2:32
obviously rated and prepared for
2:34
earthquakes. This is a facility built of
2:36
concrete and is is prepared for for
Wafer Chip
2:39
tornadoes.
2:40
Speed here comes from one radical idea,
2:42
the wafer scale engine, the largest
2:45
processor ever built.
2:46
How big is a traditional chip as
2:49
compared to what we're looking at here.
2:50
So th this is uh a chip that's 46,250
2:54
uh square millimeters. So it's the size
2:56
of a dinner plate for those of you who
2:58
don't do metric. A traditional chip was
3:01
large if it was over 750 square
3:04
millimeters. So this is the size of a
3:06
dinner plate and the largest other chip
3:08
is the size of a postage stamp or
3:10
approximately size of your thumbnail.
3:12
Each one of these systems has one chip
3:16
and it sits behind the power supplies
3:20
and it sits upright.
3:22
Traditionally people put chips on
3:24
motherboards like this,
3:25
right?
3:27
We put it upright and it sits about
3:31
halfway back.
3:32
Got it.
3:33
Okay. On the other side of it, it's
3:35
cool.
How are they so fast?
3:36
The breakthrough wasn't just size. It
3:38
was keeping memory on the chip,
3:40
eliminating the offchip latency that
3:42
slows traditional GPUs during inference.
3:45
We have all our memory on the chip.
3:49
Okay.
3:49
Other people have their memory off chip.
3:53
All right. So that latency time between
3:55
that latency time is the reason GPUs are
4:00
slow at inference.
4:02
That's it.
4:03
Got it.
4:04
Just that and we're you know 2 and a
4:06
half thousand times faster at getting to
4:09
data
4:10
and then using it.
4:11
Okay.
4:12
That's what gives this massive
4:13
performance advantage. Memory bandage.
Cooling
4:16
One wafer draws 18 kow. To move that
4:20
heat, Cerebrris adopted liquid cooling,
4:23
an approach they began in 2017. These
4:26
are water cooled machines, so they're
4:28
unbelievably energy efficient. All
4:30
right, the blue line is cold water
4:34
coming in and the red line is warm water
4:37
going out. And what you see underneath
4:40
is the way modern data centers are built
4:44
wi with raised floors. So all the water
4:47
infrastructure is is underneath. And so
4:51
you can see the the cold water, the
4:53
chilled water return. So you've got it
4:55
chilled water. You've got the orange,
4:57
which are valves by a company called
5:00
Bimo. And what they do is they tell us
5:02
all about the the water pressure and all
5:04
the details so we can keep track.
5:07
All of it ties into a 6,000 ton chiller
5:10
plant that manages temperatures and
5:12
humidity deltas to keep the wafers in
5:15
their sweet spot. Okay. So, we're here
5:17
with Billy, uh, COO of Scale Data
5:19
Centers, and tell us exactly what we're
5:21
looking at behind us and how the water
5:24
is cooled in these machines.
5:25
Yeah, so it's a, uh, 6,000 ton liquid
5:27
cooled uh, chiller plant uh, producing
5:30
uh, chilled water to uh, Cerebrus' uh,
5:33
servers. Uh, and we got room to grow
5:36
another 6,000 tons of chiller capacity.
5:39
So, if as Cerebrus grows, we can grow
5:41
chillers. Uh, we send it off in a 42°ree
5:44
water. They take it, we we uh hit it hit
5:47
it on heat exchangers and heat it back
5:48
up to about 70 degrees is what we're
5:50
sending to the uh to the wafer chip
5:53
itself. It returns back. We got cooling
5:55
towers on the outside that takes that
5:57
heat exchange uh evaporates it to
6:00
cooling towers outside the air and then
6:01
it's just a big cycle keeps going.
6:03
Why do you heat it up before sending it
6:06
to the wafers?
6:07
Uh well, we heat it up because it it
6:09
will make their wafer more efficient. it
6:11
can't handle that cold of water because
6:12
a dupoint you get moisture in the
6:14
servers and you get condensation in the
6:16
servers. So you got to keep that delta t
6:18
about a 15 uh degree delta t to keep
6:21
moisture out of the servers.
6:22
And what approach what technique is
6:24
actually cooling the water in these
6:27
machines
6:28
the chillers the condensing water. So
6:29
there's cooling condensing water that
6:31
actually cools it off. The chiller
6:33
actually produces the cooling itself.
6:35
Okay. What you can tell here is the
6:36
temperature of the inlet water and you
6:39
can tell the temperature of the outlet
6:41
water. Right? That that's exactly what's
6:43
going on. And we're able to capture this
6:46
for every CD, every part.
Power
6:48
High-speed compute demands steady power.
6:51
The primary source here, natural gas
6:54
converted into electricity with
6:56
batteries bridging about 5 minutes until
6:59
3 megawatt generators spin up. How they
7:01
maintain nearly uninterrupted service.
7:04
This is a 3 megawatt generator. It runs
7:08
on uh diesel or liquid natural gas and
7:13
it is one of the the generators that
7:15
powers the room you just saw.
7:17
Okay. So, this is a backup generator or
7:19
this is currently being used to power
7:21
it.
7:22
This is a backup generator. This is a
7:24
generator that is used if the primary
7:27
source has come down.
7:28
And what what is the primary source?
7:30
primary source is natural gas that has
7:33
been
7:34
uh converted into electricity. Yeah.
7:36
Um and then delivered to to the Rome.
7:39
Unbelievable. And I think one of your
7:41
colleagues told me this is one of four
7:43
in the entire state of Oklahoma.
7:45
Yeah. This is a a big boy. Uh these are
7:49
uh unbelievably cool generators. Um this
7:53
is how we're able to attain uh nearly
7:56
perfect uptime, right? is that uh if a
8:00
uh if there's a power outage for any
8:02
reason, these these bad boys kick on.
8:05
All right.
8:06
Instantly, no no downtime between the
8:08
switch.
8:08
Between between the two, you have a
8:10
battery backup,
8:11
right?
8:11
So the the way backups work in data
8:14
center is you have batteries whose job
8:16
it is to get you about five minutes. So
8:19
something comes down, the batteries kick
8:20
on immediately before this kicks on.
8:22
This kicks on. It takes about five
8:23
minutes before usually three, but we you
8:26
provision five. And then this bad boy is
8:28
delivering all the power you need and
8:30
you stay up,
8:32
right? And there's three of these.
8:34
So let's say the power goes out. Do all
8:36
three of these machines kick on at the
8:38
same time or are these failovers?
8:39
Each one of these is three megawws.
8:45
All right. So we have power coming in
8:48
different feeds depending on how much
8:50
failure how much power we need, right?
8:52
one, two, or three of them will kick
8:54
kick on for the room you just saw.
8:56
Right. So, when I'm hearing from other
9:00
um AI factory builders, they're talking
9:02
about gigawatt scale, but they're
9:05
talking about energy consumption rather
9:06
than uh inference output.
9:09
Correct.
9:10
But obviously you guys are are the
9:13
fastest supercomput in the world. Why
9:16
why what is why are there different
9:18
metrics? Why are they talking about it
9:19
differently? Gigawatt is a way to
9:21
describe this the capacity of this
9:23
entire building.
9:24
Okay.
9:25
All right. It is a way to say how much
9:27
power can we deliver to the compute
9:30
total
9:31
and nobody has a gigawatt today, right?
9:34
The these are still in the future
9:37
dreams. Um this is a I don't know top 50
9:41
facility in the world.
9:43
Um is what you're seeing right now.
9:45
There there are bigger but there are few
9:47
that are more efficient. I I'm I'm
9:50
wondering like because the the energy is
9:52
the input, the compute is the output.
9:55
Why not talk you guys talk about the
9:57
output, why doesn't everybody else talk
9:58
about the output? Is that because you
10:00
guys are just so much more efficient?
10:02
Yeah, because uh uh our numbers look
10:05
better than theirs if you talked about
10:07
output.
10:07
Got it. Yeah. Simple as that.
10:09
So far, we have uh seen OKC1, which is
10:13
the first data hall. That one's up and
10:15
running in production. What we're going
10:17
to see right now is OKC 2, the second
10:20
data hall that will be in production in
10:22
three or four weeks. All right, let's go
2nd Data Hall
10:23
it.
10:24
Campus is expanding fast. OKC2, the
10:27
second data hall, is nearing completion,
10:30
adding capacity for the next wave of
10:32
high-speed workloads.
10:33
Oh, it's like pretty significantly built
10:36
out already,
10:36
right? So, in the process of building,
10:41
you deploy the racks and the cabling.
10:44
So, that's step one, right? that you
10:46
roll the racks in and all of them should
10:49
be set up exactly the same way. So those
10:53
were racks. That's step one. Okay. Step
10:57
two
11:00
is the machines get inserted.
11:02
When these get turned on, how much
11:04
additional compute capacity is that
11:06
going to offer?
11:07
This room will add about 20 exoflaws. So
11:10
about 10 times the largest computer uh
11:13
that the US owns in the department of
Building in the US
11:15
energy.
11:16
The systems are manufactured and
11:17
assembled in Militus, California,
11:20
keeping the hardware pipeline domestic.
11:22
You are choosing to build in the United
11:24
States as well as you mentioned the
11:26
actual modular cerebrous units are built
11:29
in the United States. What why did you
11:31
make that decision? What does that give
11:32
you?
11:33
We manufacture in Militus, California.
11:36
We are uh committed to manufacturing in
11:39
the US.
11:40
Um we uh we package, we assemble. Uh the
11:44
final systems you saw are are
11:47
manufactured in the US. Um we we think
11:50
that uh that's an important part of of
11:53
being a good citizen in this economy.
The toughest challenge
11:56
A decade ago, the entire system,
11:58
hardware and software, was still just an
12:01
idea. The team pushed through a period
12:03
when it looked impossible. There was a a
12:06
15 or 18month period where we couldn't
12:09
do it. We were spending 8 million a
12:11
month and we hadn't solved the problem.
12:14
Wow.
12:15
And then Yeah, that's a lot of money.
12:17
And uh our board stayed with us. We used
12:20
good engineering methodology. Each
12:22
failure we root caused. We figured out
12:24
what we had to do not to make that
12:25
mistake again. Bang. We made another
12:28
mistake. We bumped into something else
12:30
again and again and again. And uh and
12:34
then one day we set it up and it worked.
12:37
And we're standing in a lab about the
12:39
size of a small office in a in a
12:42
building that wasn't designed for for
12:44
hardware. We had the windows open. We
12:47
drilled a hole in the wall for for hot
12:48
air to be piped out. And the five
12:52
founders, we stood there for 30 minutes
12:53
and we couldn't speak. That we had
12:56
solved a problem that the best in the
12:58
world over 75 years were unable to
What's next?
13:01
solve. Expect the fastest real world
13:04
transformation in medicine and
13:06
education. Two fields overdue for change
13:09
that benefit directly from faster, more
13:11
accurate models. What aspect of societal
13:15
change from AI are you personally most
13:18
excited about? A
13:19
AI and medicine. I I think AI has a
13:22
tremendous amount to offer there. In
13:25
part because our techniques previously
13:27
have been sort of rudimentary. I think
13:29
we should be able to knock years off the
13:31
drug design process. Today it's 17 19
13:34
years to develop a drug from scratch. Um
13:38
we ought to be able to get that to under
13:39
10. I'm also excited about education.
13:42
I think in many ways uh the way we teach
13:46
children has been unchanged since
13:48
Alexander the Great was tutored by
13:51
Aristotle. AI offers a very different uh
13:55
opportunity to change the way we teach
13:57
children. Well, Andrew, thank you so
13:59
much. Congratulations on everything and
14:01
uh I can't wait to see this uh continue
14:03
to be built out.
14:04
Well, thank you so much for having us.
