Dan Koe is a 28-year-old American digital writer, entrepreneur, and content creator known for his philosophy on "one-person businesses" and for building a personal brand through consistent, high-leverage writing. He shares insights on personal development, productivity, philosophy, and digital entrepreneurship through various online platforms and products.

Career and business model
- Early days: Koe's career as an online creator began with self-education in web development after growing disillusioned with college. In 2020, he started publishing his writing on X (formerly Twitter) and rapidly grew an audience.
- Emphasis on writing: Writing is the primary driver of Koe's content flywheel and business. He writes consistently for his newsletter, The Koe Letter, which he uses to generate ideas for content across his other platforms, including YouTube. His writing covers topics on mindset, personal autonomy, and thriving in the new digital economy.
- Digital entrepreneurship: Koe advocates for building a "one-person business" by leveraging the internet to create and sell digital products. His revenue is generated through online courses, premium guides, and books.
- Second brain software: As a co-founder, Koe has also developed Kortex, a "second brain" software designed for writers and creators to capture, organize, and develop content ideas.

Philosophy and key concepts
Koe's content often explores the connections between modern entrepreneurship, psychology, and self-development. Key tenets of his philosophy include:
- Built, not found, purpose: In his 2025 book Purpose & Profit, Koe argues that purpose is not something to be discovered through introspection, but something that is built through action and contribution.
- Focused work over hustle: He posits that high-quality, focused work is more effective than long hours of distracted "hustle." He suggests channeling creative energy into meaningful tasks and eliminating distractions to maximize productivity.
- Modern superpower is focus: In an attention-starved digital world, Koe emphasizes that the ability to maintain uninterrupted focus is a crucial skill for success and personal growth.
- The anti-vision: To gain clarity on one's vision for the future, Koe teaches defining a clear "anti-vision"—the worst possible life you want to avoid. This provides a strong sense of direction and motivation.
- Entrepreneurship as a mindset: Koe promotes an entrepreneurial mindset that prioritizes initiative, adaptation, and value creation, regardless of one's job title.
