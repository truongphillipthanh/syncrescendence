Intro
0:00
Okay, so if you are building a business of any kind, where you are doing some kind
0:05
of manufacturing or providing a service, one of the things that you learn quite
0:10
quickly is that you need to develop a set of standard operating procedures.
0:15
Basically, this is like a list of what needs to get done, in what
0:19
order to what sort of quality.
0:23
In my twenties, I built a company that did manufacturing of CDs and CDRs and DVD-Rs,
0:29
and, And we had a whole bunch of different SOPs for everything from the design,
0:34
of, the packaging, right through to the requirements that would give the factory
0:38
when they were doing manufacturing.
0:40
and even things like the cartoon boxes that we shipped all the products in had
0:44
to be custom made so that they would have our logo on it and stuff like that.
0:49
the good thing was once we had the SOPs, then it was very easy to be
0:53
able to just put in orders and make the whole thing kind of run itself.
0:58
Now in this video I wanna talk about how some of the big companies are
1:00
now getting agents to adopt standard operating procedures for different tasks.
Claude Skills
1:07
we are seeing this in a number of different places at the moment.
1:11
The main one I'm gonna talk about in this video is something that
1:14
Anthropic just announced called skills.
1:17
But I'm also gonna touch on the Claude Code plugins and
1:20
the Gemini CLI extensions.
1:22
In many ways, all three of these things are ways of giving your agents a set
1:27
of standard operating procedures that they can follow to do the different
1:32
tasks that you want them to do.
Core Patterns
1:34
So I think it's no surprise at this point that the quality of your agents
1:38
and the quality of your output from any LLM is going to be about the
1:43
context that you put into this, right?
1:45
Lots of people have been talking about context engineering And really
1:49
this goes back a few years, right?
1:51
These models are basically doing a conditional probability
1:55
where they're conditioning on whatever you put into them.
1:59
so the better the quality of the context that you are inputting to the LLM or
2:03
to your agent the better the quality you're actually going to get out.
2:08
So just like humans need SOPs to reduce variability, agents need them even more.
2:14
And you can kind of think of this as a sort of core pattern of where
2:18
you've got inputs coming in, going through a series of steps, having key
2:22
decision points, using tools, having some kind of output, and then perhaps
2:27
even having a verification at the end to check the output is actually
2:32
what was supposed to be produced.
Introducing Claude Skills Blog
2:34
So if we jump into the Anthropic announcement, they're talking
2:37
here about Claude skills.
2:40
And interestingly, this is something that is not only for
2:44
the, Claude chat online interface.
2:48
This is also something you can use with the API.
2:51
so it really shows that they're seeing that this is sort of like a key
2:54
fundamental thing for people building better agents, and better workflows
2:59
for using the anthropic models.
3:01
So what actually is a skill here?
3:03
skills are folders that include instructions, scripts, and resources
3:08
that Claude can load when needed.
3:11
Claude will only access the skill when it's relevant.
3:13
Now they've made a bunch of pre-made skills
3:16
for things like working with Excel files, creating presentations,
3:20
formatting documents and stuff like that.
3:22
And if you think about it, you can look at this as part of the original MCP spec.
3:28
Most people focus on MCPs purely as API calls or data ingestion.
3:34
But there is a third thing in there for context of sort of prompts and
3:39
being able to access and pull back prompts to go into the model context.
3:44
In many ways, you could think of this as making a new way to do that kind of task.
3:49
All right, so they talk about how skills work, that basically it
3:53
will scan for any relevant matches.
3:56
Now, they don't tell us how they're doing this, whether this is done
3:59
with some kind of similarity check between what you type in and what
4:04
your skills are called, et cetera.
4:06
But they do tell us that the skills are composable, that they can stack
4:10
together, that they're portable, so that once you've got them, you can use them
4:14
not only in the sort of Claude apps, but you can use them in Claude Code.
4:18
You can use them with the API as well.
4:21
and clearly they've put a bit of effort into how Claude is going to
4:24
actually decide which skill to use by talking about that these only get
4:29
loaded when they're actually needed.
4:32
So if you come into the Claude settings, you can actually go to the
4:35
capabilities and they've got a bunch of these already pre-made there.
4:40
And one of them is a skill creator, so this is kind of cool, that they've got a
4:45
skill to actually help you make skills.
4:48
and so the skill creator, it's basically its job is to help you
4:51
provide, interactive guidance for you to design a workflow, design
4:56
something, and then it's going to, work out that folder structure and create
5:01
what they call the skill.md file.
5:03
So that's gonna be one of the key things that sort of directs what the actual
5:07
steps will be, what the syntax will be, and how it's gonna use any tools,
5:11
And in many ways this is kind of similar to things that we've seen
5:15
with coding for quite a while, right?
5:17
We've had things like agents.md cursor has had their own sort of custom instructions.
5:23
Pretty much every coding agent now has a way of, you sort of preloading a
5:29
bunch of custom instructions in there.
5:31
So the cool thing is this skill will actually help you to make
5:34
more skills, But that said, you can go through it and do it yourself.
5:39
So, like I mentioned early on, one of the other things that's really
5:41
interesting about this is this is not just for their sort of, Claude chat UI.
5:47
this isn't gonna be available in the API as well.
5:50
So they talk about the agent skills, which we often refer to as simply skills, can
5:54
now be added to the messages API requests.
5:58
And they've got a whole endpoint for doing that.
5:59
And the code execution tool, at the back to be able to use those as well.
6:05
And with things like this, we're actually starting to see quite a bit of divergence
6:09
between the actual LLM providers APIs.
6:13
So we've got all the main foundation model providers
6:17
actually updating how their APIs work to be able to work
6:21
better with their background tools and the tools that they're
6:25
adding on to the API that they will run themselves.
6:28
For example, the Gemini, API has Google search, et cetera.
6:32
So on top of them talking about this for the consumer stuff,
6:34
they've also outlined how this can actually be sort of used for agents.
6:41
And you can see here this whole idea of the agent configuration, where it's going
6:45
to basically have skills, equipped for different things and it's gonna have,
6:50
different MCPs that it can connect to.
6:53
And you can see here that it's using backend code execution to be able to
6:57
access, different folders in that skills directory for things like being able to
7:03
format, documents in a certain way, to be able to deal with PDFs to be able to
7:08
use a database like BigQuery, et cetera.
7:11
And when we are looking at this, there's more detail about the actual anatomy of
7:15
a skill, and of the skill.md file that it will have basically a name, a description.
7:20
And you can see in many ways there are elements in here that are similar to
7:25
the whole sort of prompt layer of MCPs.
7:29
they have some nice examples in here of some different skills of
7:33
how you can do things like bundling additional content that can be used
7:37
and loaded just when it's needed
7:39
And even showing you how this stuff actually gets used,
7:43
In the actual context window when combined with things like
7:45
tools and other MCPs, et cetera.
7:48
Now in many ways, this is also similar to what they're doing with Claude
7:51
Code plugins and what Google is doing with the Gemini CLI extensions.
7:55
You want to package up things as these sort of skills.
8:00
Now for the CLI code tools, that's gonna include things like subagent/commands,
8:06
MCP servers and it's probably a lot more detailed and intense,
8:11
But fundamentally, it's still the same idea of getting the best context into
8:16
the actual model when you need it to be able to produce the output that you want.
8:21
So it is interesting to see as we go forward with this, the whole idea
8:25
of plugin marketplaces, or you could almost think of these as context window
8:29
marketplaces where people can make a whole bunch of different things that
8:33
you can package up and serve through.
8:36
And it also is developing this idea of where these chat platforms like your,
8:42
Claude Chat, your Gemini chat, your Chat-GPT, et cetera, are becoming full
8:47
on platforms, that, can host apps, and can be able to do a whole bunch
8:52
of different agentic tasks for you.
8:54
we saw that as part of the announcement that OpenAI introduced
8:58
recently at their dev day for apps.
9:01
And one thing to note here is that this is not just one of the
9:05
foundation model companies doing this.
9:07
They're all jumping on the bandwagon.
9:09
you're tending to see OpenAI, Google and Anthropic all be
9:13
moving in the same direction here.
9:16
And then other providers like Mistral and perhaps some of the Chinese
9:19
companies, sort of fast following with integrating a lot of these
9:23
ideas into their platforms as well.
9:25
So just to finish up, I would say go and check out the Claude skills.
9:29
and if you've got access to it, go into the Claude Chat and actually try
9:32
getting it to make, something like you can see here, I'm just saying,
9:35
okay, take my YouTube transcripts, and turn it into LinkedIn, content.
9:40
It will walk you through a bunch of different steps before it comes to
9:43
the final sort of output, And you can see, interestingly, it's obviously
9:47
knows what you've got connected that I have notion connected, to this.
9:51
So you will have to correct it, and guide it in the way that you want to.
9:55
But the cool thing is you can then take that skill and put
9:58
in your own custom prompts.
10:00
You can do a whole bunch of different things to create your own
10:03
standard operating procedures for using these platforms the platform
10:08
is no longer just a chat app,
10:10
It's really a set of personal agents that you can use.
Skill Authoring Best Practices
10:13
All right, so after I recorded the video, I found some other
10:16
really interesting things in here.
10:18
the first one is the best practices, If you go through this deeply,
10:22
you see a lot of interesting things about conserving tokens.
10:26
they've got this example of basically getting the.
10:29
extract PDF out of using approximately 50 tokens, and they talk about
10:34
using this as opposed to, using something too verbose in here.
10:39
I also find it interesting that if you know how to write code, perhaps writing
10:43
some code to put in these things Or when you're making it with their skill
10:48
for making skills, that putting code into this actually seems to work more
10:52
than just writing, plain English The other thing that's really fascinating is
10:56
they've now got this repo of skills up and that's got a whole bunch of different
11:01
skills that they made themselves.
11:03
So you can see their skill creator in here.
11:07
we can see the Skill MD talking about, how it does everything, what the process is,
11:13
and we can say that's reasonably long, and we can see that they've got Python, code
11:17
in here for doing the packaging of this, doing the validation of this, et cetera.
11:23
the other thing that I found really interesting is the license.
11:26
for some of these you'll see they're Apache two licensed.
11:29
which is what I would expect, this to be.
11:32
But if we come in and look at some of the others, like in the
11:35
document skills, Excel file stuff we see, this is not Apache license.
11:39
This is strictly copyright of anthropic, and all rights reserved.
11:45
It does seem that they're planting a flag here, that they don't
11:48
want, other providers, ripping off these and putting them into their
11:53
own take on this kind of thing.
11:55
But if you do want to get into this, this repo is definitely worth checking
11:59
out to actually see, how they're doing a bunch of different things in here for
12:03
things like brand guidelines a whole bunch of things around the documents,
12:08
MCP builders, skill creators, et cetera.
12:12
My guess is that going forward we will have repos of awesome skills,
12:17
That's something you could imagine, we're gonna start seeing reasonably
12:20
quickly where people are actually gonna start putting this kind of thing up.
12:25
Anyway, let me know in the comments what is the most unusual thing
12:29
you could be using this for?
12:30
do you have standard operating procedures or things that perhaps are not obvious
12:34
I feel like we've seen the whole repurposing of content or writing tweets
12:38
But my guess is that there's probably a lot of really cool
12:41
things people are doing that.
12:43
are not obvious And I would say also that if you want to protect your skills, you
12:48
may want to consider turning off, allowing Anthropic to train on these skills.
12:54
I'm sure part of their goals for improving the Claude models is to
12:57
get as many skills so that they can work out what are the key things they
13:01
need to be training the models for.
13:04
So let me know what unusual SOPs or unusual things you are doing
13:08
with these platform agents.
13:10
And where you would like to see this go in the future.
13:13
