Dr. Alok Kanojia, also known as "Dr. K," is a Harvard-trained psychiatrist and co-founder of the mental health platform Healthy Gamer. He is a prominent figure in the online mental health space, recognized for his expertise in addressing modern mental health issues related to the internet, technology, and gaming. 
Background and education
- Childhood and gaming: As a child, Kanojia was an avid gamer who discovered video games as a place where he could feel equal to his peers after skipping a grade in school. He later struggled with video game addiction as a teenager, which contributed to his failing out of college.
- Spiritual and medical journey: At age 21, he traveled to India and spent seven years studying yoga and meditation, seeking to overcome his addiction and find purpose. This experience introduced him to a new system of understanding himself, which he later sought to verify through Western scientific research. He returned to the US to pursue a career in medicine, earning his MD from Tufts University School of Medicine and completing his psychiatric residency at the Harvard Medical School MGH/McLean program.
- Integrating Eastern and Western thought: Kanojia blends his knowledge of traditional Eastern philosophies, such as yoga and Ayurveda, with Western neuroscience and psychiatry to create a unique perspective on mental health. 
Healthy Gamer and online presence
- Origins: In 2018, Kanojia hosted a Q&A on Reddit that received an overwhelming response from people seeking mental health advice. Inspired by the demand, he launched a Twitch channel in 2019 to provide resources for the online community.
- Twitch and YouTube: As "Dr. K," he gained a large following by hosting live, compassionate interviews with gamers and internet creators about their mental health struggles. These conversations address topics such as anxiety, depression, burnout, and loneliness, often using gaming analogies to help his audience understand complex psychological concepts.
Healthy Gamer platform: He co-founded Healthy Gamer, a digital mental health company, to formalize his efforts. The platform offers a range of resources, including:
