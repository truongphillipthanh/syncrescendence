The top 10 papers to understand AI engineering
0:00
In this video, we're talking about the
0:02
top 10 papers you need to read to
0:03
understand AI engineering today. I'll go
0:05
over the most important papers that
0:07
shaped this new and evolving industry.
0:09
From model architecture to fine-tuning
0:12
to applications like rag and agents,
0:14
I'll share a quick overview of the paper
0:16
itself and the most important takeaways.
0:18
So, you will know how these systems work
0:20
and how we got here. Starting from the
0:22
first breakthroughs all the way to the
0:24
more recent advancements. This is
0:25
exactly the kind of thing you need to
0:26
know for AI engineering interviews. So,
0:28
take notes. Let's get started. When most
0:30
of us think about AI, we think about
0:32
large language models, which are a kind
0:33
of neural network. But neural networks
0:35
were invented in the 1940s. So why did
0:38
this become such a big deal in the last
0:39
couple of years? One of the main reasons
0:41
is a breakthrough in 2017. That year,
0:44
researchers from Google released the
0:45
famous attention is all you need paper,
Paper #1
0:47
which introduced the transformer
0:49
architecture. Before transformers, we
0:51
relied on recurrent and convolutional
0:53
networks that processed text step by
0:56
step. That meant kind of slow training,
0:58
trouble with long range dependencies
1:00
like connecting details that appear far
1:01
apart in documents, and difficulty
1:03
parallelizing across GPUs, which matters
1:06
because training speed and cost scale
1:08
with how well you can split the work
1:10
across many chips. Transformers replaced
1:12
that with self attention, which lets the
1:14
model look at all the words in a
1:16
sentence at once and learn which ones
1:18
matter to each other. Training became
1:20
massively parallel, context handling
1:22
improved, and scale suddenly became more
1:24
favorable for engineers. This paper was
1:26
a big deal. It changed the shape of the
1:28
whole field and today almost every
1:30
modern language model descends from this
1:32
design. Now a few years later in 2020 we
1:34
get another big leap with language
Paper #2
1:37
models are few shot learners the GPT3
1:39
paper. The surprising finding was that
1:41
if you scale transformers up enough they
1:43
start to perform new tasks from just a
1:46
few examples in the prompt. No task
1:48
specific fine-tuning required. You can
1:50
just describe what you want and show a
1:51
couple of patterns and the model figures
1:53
it out surprisingly well. The team
1:54
discovered this by training a very large
1:57
decoderonly transformer and
1:58
systematically evaluating it on many
2:01
tasks by only changing the text prompt.
2:03
Zero shot meaning just instructions, one
2:05
shot, one example, and few shot a
2:08
handful of examples. The breakthrough
2:09
wasn't a new architecture or anything.
2:11
It was demonstrating that scale plus
2:13
prompting unlocks in context learning,
2:16
meaning that the model can infer a task
2:18
just from patterns in the prompt. For
2:20
practitioners, this reframed how we
2:21
build systems. Instead of training a new
2:23
model for each task, we can often prompt
2:25
a general model to do what we need. But
2:27
since then, we've learned that just
2:28
scaling up forever doesn't solve all our
2:30
problems. Instruction tuning and
2:32
reinforcement learning from human
2:34
feedback made these models far more
2:35
consistent and helpful. In 2022,
2:37
researchers at OpenAI released a paper
2:39
titled training language models to
Paper #3
2:41
follow instructions with human feedback,
2:43
aka the instruct GPT paper. This paper
2:45
tried to improve models that respond in
2:47
unhelpful or toxic ways by tuning the
2:49
model with reinforcement learning from
2:50
human feedback. Basically, you first
2:52
fine-tune on examples of good behavior
2:54
called supervised instruction tuning.
2:56
Then you train a reward model to prefer
2:58
better answers over worse ones based on
3:00
human rankings. And finally, you adjust
3:03
the base model to produce answers the
3:04
reward model prefers. The main finding
3:07
from this paper was that a smaller
3:08
aligned model could be preferred over a
3:10
much larger unaligned one because it
3:12
follows directions and respects user
3:14
intent. Since then, there have been new
3:16
advances in the areas of model
3:17
alignment. For example, you'll hear
3:19
about DPO or direct preference
3:21
optimization which learns directly from
3:23
ranked preferences without an explicit
3:25
reward model. Now, it's one thing to
3:26
read these papers, but building reliable
3:28
AI systems is a different challenge
3:30
altogether. Back when I was mentoring at
3:32
Interview Kickstart, I saw so many
3:34
people who could explain the theory, but
3:36
struggled to design systems that would
3:38
actually work in the real world. That's
3:39
exactly why Ike put together the Aentic
3:41
AI career boost program. It's 14 weeks
3:44
of hands-on projects guided by mentors
3:46
from top tech companies. So, you can
3:47
move from just understanding the
3:49
research to actually building production
3:50
systems, things like agentic systems
3:52
with orchestration, multi-agent systems,
3:54
and guardrails. You complete two guided
3:56
live projects in the program so you
3:58
build something tangible for your
3:59
portfolio in the end. If this sounds
4:01
interesting to you, check out the free
4:02
webinar link in the description. This is
4:04
a great opportunity to check it out, ask
4:06
any questions, and see if it's a good
4:07
fit for you. I had a really good
4:08
experience mentoring with Ike, so it's
4:10
certainly worth your time to check out
4:11
the free webinar if you're interested in
4:12
AI engineering. Now, back to the papers
4:14
because we have a lot more interesting
4:15
stuff to cover. Okay, so even if we have
Paper #4
4:17
a model that's aligned, it might not
4:19
perform well on our specific tasks. For
4:21
example, maybe we want to return
4:23
responses in a particular format or use
4:25
language from a specific domain like
4:27
legal or medical texts. Besides in
4:29
context learning, aka prompt
4:31
engineering, another approach to
4:32
teaching the model how you want it to
4:33
respond is fine-tuning. When we
4:35
fine-tune, we continue training the
4:37
model on examples of the behavior we
4:39
want, so it internalizes those patterns.
4:41
Full fine-tuning updates all the
4:42
weights, which is time and compute
4:44
inensive. In 2021, the Laura paper gave
4:47
us a practical way to fine-tune really
4:48
large models cheaply. Instead of
4:50
updating all the weights, you insert
4:52
small low rank adapters, which are tiny
4:54
matrices that nudge the big weight
4:56
matrices in a lowdimensional direction,
4:58
and just train those. you keep the base
5:00
model frozen, which results in 10,000
5:03
times fewer trainable parameters and
5:04
about three times lower GPU memory than
5:06
full fine-tuning on certain setups.
5:08
Laura turned fine-tuning from a research
5:10
project into something you can do on a
5:11
single GPU. Over time, we've combined
5:13
Laura with quantization coming up in
5:15
paper 9 for even bigger savings. Even
Paper #5
5:17
once we fine-tuned, one of the
5:19
challenges from these models was having
5:21
limited access to information from
5:22
outside of their training data. We need
5:24
some way to be able to access new
5:26
information from after the training data
5:28
end date or something like private
5:29
company data. The paper retrieval
5:31
augmented generation for knowledge
5:33
inensive NLP tasks from 2020 proposed a
5:36
solution. Before the model answers, have
5:38
it retrieve relevant documents and let
5:40
the model read them before it responds.
5:42
This attempts to address two issues at
5:43
once, old knowledge and hallucination.
5:46
Instead of relying on whatever the model
5:47
memorized during pre-training, you can
5:49
plug it into your internal database or
5:50
the public web and have it site what it
5:52
finds. This is the pattern used by many
5:54
production LLM systems today. Over time,
5:56
we've learned that retrieval quality is
5:57
really important. The approaches you use
5:59
for chunking, indexing, search ranking,
6:01
and query rewriting often matter more
6:03
than the specific base model you choose.
6:05
We've also moved from just grabbing the
6:06
top K best matches and hoping for the
6:08
best to a multi-step pipeline that
6:10
iteratively asks better questions and
6:13
adds all the information together across
6:14
many sources with evaluation methods
6:16
that check faithfulness and site those
6:18
sources. So now we have these powerful
Paper #6
6:20
models and we can give them access to
6:22
real data, but they still don't do
6:24
anything by themselves. That's where
6:25
agents come in. I'm cheating a little
6:27
with our list because this next paper is
6:28
a survey. The rise and potential of
6:30
large language model based agents, but
6:32
it's a useful summary of the space as of
6:34
2023. The survey lays out a simple way
6:37
to think about agents. Brain, the LLM
6:39
plans and decides what to do next.
6:41
Perception, the agent reads what's going
6:43
on. Tool results, files, web pages,
6:46
memory, that kind of thing. and action.
6:47
It takes a step like call an API, run a
6:50
tool or write something. Then looks at
6:51
the result and repeats. The survey walks
6:53
through common setups like single agent,
6:55
multi- aent teams, and agents working
6:57
with humans, plus fun ideas like agent
7:00
societies where behaviors emerge from
7:01
many agents interacting. It also notes
7:04
the practical stuff that actually makes
7:05
agents work, like clear tool schemas,
7:07
guardrails to stop runaway loops, and
7:09
checks to verify the final result.
7:11
Finally, it covers how to evaluate
7:12
agents and lists open problems in the
7:14
space. Let's switch gears to scale and
Paper #7
7:16
efficiency. The paper switch
7:18
transformers scaling to trillion
7:20
parameter models with simple and
7:21
efficient sparity took the transformer
7:23
and made it sparse using a mixture of
7:25
experts. Basically, imagine having many
7:28
specialized mini networks. These are the
7:30
experts. For each incoming token, a
7:32
small router decides which single expert
7:34
is most relevant and only that expert
7:37
runs. You still store lots of
7:38
parameters, but you only use a small
7:40
fraction for any one token. So, it's
7:42
faster and cheaper. The paper showed
7:43
that conditional computation or only
7:45
computing what you need when you need it
7:47
can push scale much farther than dense
7:48
models that run every parameter on every
7:50
token. That matters because it lets you
7:52
build larger capacity without paying for
7:54
all of it on every forward pass. What
7:56
we've learned since then is that serving
7:58
sparse models is an engineering
7:59
challenge because we have to think about
8:01
things like balancing traffic across
8:02
experts, keeping latency low, and
8:04
avoiding bottlenecks. Many teams today
8:06
choose moderately sized dense models
8:09
plus retrieval and good tooling because
8:11
the total effort is lower. Now let's
Paper #8
8:13
think about making models really small.
8:14
The 2019 distilbert paper showed that
8:17
you could compress a model using
8:18
knowledge distillation. This is when we
8:20
teach a smaller student model to mimic a
8:22
larger teacher model. Ideally, this
8:24
helps us retain most of the accuracy of
8:26
the bigger model, but at a fraction of
8:28
the cost. The paper showed that general
8:29
knowledge distillation during
8:30
pre-training resulted in about 40% fewer
8:32
parameters and about 60% faster,
8:35
retaining 97% of birds language
8:37
understanding. This matters for things
8:38
like deployment to edge devices where
8:40
you have tight latency budgets, limited
8:42
memory, and maybe privacy constraints or
8:44
no internet access. A compact model can
8:46
run on a phone unlocks a lot of
8:48
practical use cases. Another way to make
Paper #9
8:50
models smaller is a technique called
8:51
quantization. In simple terms,
8:53
quantization stores numbers with fewer
8:55
bits like 8-bit integers instead of 16
8:58
or 32-bit floats. So, the model takes
9:00
less memory and math is faster. The
9:02
challenge is doing that without hurting
9:03
accuracy. Quantization has been around
9:05
for a long time, but the 2022 LLM.8
9:08
paper was the first to show a method
9:10
that keeps transformer performance
9:11
intact at multi-billion parameter scale.
9:13
It does this by being outlier aware.
9:15
Their key observation is that a tiny
9:17
number of outlier features which are
9:19
individual channels with unusually large
9:21
activations especially in attention or
9:23
feed forward layers are what break naive
9:26
int8ate quantization. Their solution is
9:28
to quantize most features at int8ate and
9:30
outlier features at FP16 or BF-16. This
9:33
mixed precision trick preserves quality
9:35
while roughly having memory for the
9:37
largest components making single GPU
9:39
inference feasible for models that
9:41
previously needed a small cluster. In
9:43
practice, it lowers serving cost and
9:44
accelerates prototyping, often with
9:46
negligible accuracy loss. It also pairs
9:48
well with parameter efficient
9:49
fine-tuning like Laura for when you need
9:51
task specific behavior to be efficient.
9:53
And last but not least, I wanted to
“Paper” #10
9:54
include MCP in this list despite the
9:56
fact that it was not announced via a
9:58
paper. So, we're using the announcement
9:59
docs instead. MCP or model context
10:02
protocol is Anthropic's 2024 open
10:04
standard for connecting models to the
10:05
world. The basic idea is that instead of
10:07
hand coding a one-off integration for
10:09
every database, API, or developer tool
10:11
you want your model to interact with,
10:13
you run or connect to MCP servers that
10:14
expose tools, resources, and prompt in a
10:16
standard schema. Any MCP capable client
10:19
like an IDE, an agent runtime, or a chat
10:21
app, can discover those capabilities,
10:23
call tools, stream results, and keep
10:24
shared context. So, that's our list. It
10:26
was hard to pick just 10. There are so
10:28
many other important papers. Some areas
10:30
we didn't talk about at all are things
10:32
like scaling laws, infrastructure, and
10:33
system design. There's a lot going on in
10:35
this space as you can imagine, but
10:36
hopefully this gives you a good starting
10:38
point to this exciting field. If you
