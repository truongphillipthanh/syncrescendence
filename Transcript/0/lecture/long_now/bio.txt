The Long Now Foundation is a non-profit organization established in 1996 to foster long-term thinking and counteract humanity's increasingly short-term mindset. The foundation's work addresses "civilization-scale challenges" by encouraging people to think within a 10,000-year framework, which they call "the long now". 

Origin and founding principles
The Long Now Foundation was founded by a group of forward-thinking individuals from diverse backgrounds:
- Stewart Brand: An author, environmentalist, and founder of the Whole Earth Catalog. He observed that civilization was developing a "pathologically short attention span".
- Danny Hillis: A computer scientist and inventor who proposed the initial idea for a 10,000-year clock to stimulate long-term thinking.
- Brian Eno: A musician and artist who coined the term "the long now" after observing the modern culture's accelerated sense of time. 
The founders' goal was to build a cultural institution that would not only talk about the long term but also undertake practical projects that embody and require a long-term perspective. 

Core projects
The foundation brings its mission to life through large-scale, symbolic, and practical projects:
- The Clock of the Long Now: A monument-scale mechanical clock, designed by Danny Hillis, that is intended to keep time for 10,000 years. The project is under construction inside a mountain in West Texas. The hope is that the clock will become a lasting mythic monument that inspires a multi-generational perspective.
- The Rosetta Project: An initiative to create a comprehensive, publicly accessible digital library of human languages to combat linguistic extinction. The project has also produced a durable nickel alloy disc containing thousands of languages, with one version having been sent into space on the European Space Agency's Rosetta Mission.
- Seminars About Long-Term Thinking (SALT): A monthly lecture series in San Francisco that features influential thinkers discussing topics relevant to the long-term future. The seminars are released as popular podcasts, spreading the ideas of long-term thinking to a global audience.
- The Manual for Civilization: A library of 3,500 books intended to provide a condensed, curated record of human knowledge and technology for the current generation and their descendants. The collection is housed at The Interval, the foundation's public space.
- PanLex: A linguistic project that seeks to build an open-source, panlingual lexical database to overcome language barriers to human information and rights.
- The Interval: A publicly accessible bar, café, and museum located at the foundation's headquarters in San Francisco. It serves as a social space for conversation and exhibits that promote long-term thinking. 

Broader influence
The Long Now Foundation has inspired several related projects and concepts:
- Revive & Restore: An organization that spun off from the foundation, focusing on genetic engineering projects, including the de-extinction of species.
- Use of 5-digit dates: To help visualize a 10,000-year timeframe, the foundation uses a five-digit year format (e.g., 02025) to solve the "Year 10,000 problem". 
Through its physical projects, events, and philosophical ideas, the Long Now Foundation seeks to reframe humanity's relationship with time and inspire responsibility for a deep and uncertain future.
