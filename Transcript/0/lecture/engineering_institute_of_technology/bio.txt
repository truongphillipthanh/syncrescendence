The Engineering Institute of Technology (EIT) is a global private college specializing exclusively in engineering and technology education. With headquarters in Perth, Australia, EIT serves a diverse student body from over 160 countries through a unique blended learning model. The institute offers a comprehensive suite of programs, from short professional certificates to bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and a Doctor of Engineering.

History
- 1991: EIT's origins trace back to its sister company, IDC Technologies, which began providing engineering short courses and workshops to major corporations like Rolls Royce.
- 2009: EIT was established to expand these educational offerings, building on IDC Technologies' industry connections.
- 2014: The institute began delivering higher education programs after becoming a nationally registered Higher Education Provider in Australia.
- 2018: EIT opened its first physical campus in Perth, Australia, followed by a second campus in Melbourne in 2019, allowing it to offer on-campus programs to international students. A third campus was opened in Brisbane in 2024.

Unique educational model
EIT's distinct methodology is founded on several core principles:
- Industry-focused curriculum: Courses are developed by an international panel of engineering experts to ensure the content is current and relevant to modern industry.
- Global, experienced lecturers: EIT draws on a worldwide pool of highly experienced engineers and applied-knowledge professionals to deliver its courses.
- Interactive online learning: A blended online model includes live, interactive webinars, remote and virtual laboratories, and simulation software. This system allows for flexible learning and was particularly effective during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Dedicated student support: Students receive support from dedicated Learning Support Officers and lecturers, and benefit from small class sizes that encourage engagement.

Recognition and achievements
The institute's unique approach has earned it numerous accolades:
- In the 2020/2021 Australian Government's Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching (QILT) surveys, EIT ranked #1 for overall undergraduate student experience among 55 Australian engineering schools.
- It has won multiple national and state awards, including the Australian International Education and Training Award in 2021.
- In 2024, EIT was recognized with the International Education Award at the Australian Export Awards.
- Many of EIT's programs are recognized under international engineering accords, and the institute was granted self-accrediting authority for its higher education courses.

Mission and vision
EIT's core mission is to provide industry-oriented engineering and technology education that translates into measurable productivity gains for students in the workplace. The institute's vision is to become an internationally recognized Australian University College for its engineering programs by 2032, producing highly sought-after, job-ready graduates. This reflects the founder's belief that "Education is the most powerful weapon which we can use to change the world".
