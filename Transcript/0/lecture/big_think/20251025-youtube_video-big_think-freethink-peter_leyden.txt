We are living through the collapse of the old world, and the quiet construction of a new one. From artificial intelligence and clean energy to bioengineering and digital governance, the core systems that defined the last century are rapidly being dismantled and replaced. But this isn’t just about technology. 

According to futurist Peter Leyden, we’re at a historic turning point: One of the rare moments in American and global history when everything gets reimagined at once.

An extraordinary moment in history
0:00
We're living in an extraordinary moment
0:02
in history. We are at a moment here in
0:05
2025 where we have world historic
0:08
gamechanging technologies now starting
0:11
to scale. But America and the world
0:13
itself are going through huge
0:15
contortions.
0:17
And there's been three previous
0:20
junctures where Americans have found
0:22
themselves in this exact place. And the
0:24
key piece of this is tipping points.
0:27
When do you go from the slow slow build
0:30
of a thing that's kind of clunky and not
0:32
really working to you all of a sudden
0:34
get an iPhone that goes, "Holy
0:36
this is the most amazing thing in the
0:37
world." And then everybody needs them.
0:40
And what I'm trying to tell you now is
0:41
we are in the middle of three tipping
0:44
points that are world historic changes
0:47
that are happening around it. I'm Pete
0:50
Leiden. I've basically been following
0:51
the story of technology and its
0:53
evolution and looking ahead into how
0:55
it's going to change the world over the
0:56
next 25 years.
1:00
[Music]
Wired magazine
1:05
Way back way back in the '9s and the
1:08
earliest days of the internet, there was
1:10
really only one place in the world that
1:12
was really all over that and that was
1:13
Wired magazine. And it was in those
1:16
early days that the founders of Wired
1:19
picked up on me as someone who had the
1:21
same kind of sensibility about the
1:23
transformative nature of these
1:24
technologies. And so they wooed me to
1:26
work with them in the early days of
1:28
Wired. Now people had no idea what was
1:32
even going on with the internet and
1:34
literally what's email, what's the web.
1:36
They had no idea how these goofball
1:38
startups with names like Amazon were
1:40
ever going to amount to anything. And
1:42
the other thing that was going on there
1:43
beyond this digital revolution was
1:45
essentially the beginning of
1:46
globalization. And so myself and my
1:49
co-author which was Peter Schwarz wrote
1:52
a famous iconic cover story at Wired
1:54
that was called the long boom. And it
1:56
was a history of the future. The story
1:58
from 1980 which was in our past to 2020
2:01
which was in our future trying to
2:03
explain what was really coming.
Technology adoption curve
2:09
Now those of us who are in technology
2:10
and those of us have been immersed in it
2:12
which I have been for most of my career
2:14
now can see clearly these kind of
2:17
incremental stages of these new
2:19
technologies that all successful new
2:22
technologies go through a technology
2:23
adoption curve. Let's say like Uber, the
2:27
idea like, oh my god, instead of a taxi,
2:29
it's all on your phone and then all of a
2:30
sudden when enough people show how
2:32
amazing it is, boom, the entire crew
2:35
moves over and the old system of the
2:37
taxi system is gone.
2:39
So, you're watching an old system being
2:41
essentially dismantled or having to come
2:43
down at the same time as we're taking
2:45
off on these new technologies to build
2:46
the next systems. We're in the middle of
2:50
that right now is smack in the middle of
2:52
that in our era. But we've also seen
80 year cycles
2:54
this in American history before.
2:56
There's been three previous junctures
2:59
where Americans have found themselves in
3:01
this exact place. Now, that's not to say
3:02
it's common. Like, you know, this is 80
3:04
years ago, the last time we saw this,
3:06
and they tend to come in these 80ear
3:08
cycles. But what's amazing about these
3:10
things is they have bursts of
3:13
unbelievably widespread innovation that
3:15
last for 25 years. The last big one was
3:18
coming off World War II, 1945.
3:22
80 years ago, America was on a very
3:24
similar parallels.
Post-war era
3:28
[Music]
3:31
We had basically were watching the
3:34
essentially dismantling of the old world
3:37
that had been working pretty well, the
3:39
economy and societies of the west and
3:42
then there had been a crash and you run
3:44
into the great depression of the 1930s.
3:47
Now what that was was the old system of
3:49
running the economy just wasn't working.
3:50
And so what happens is you watch these
3:52
junctures in American society. We get
3:55
super polarized. For example, there was
3:57
an America first movement in the 30s. We
4:00
were on the verge of violent conflict in
4:03
America. And then you had the FDR and
4:05
the kind of New Deal coalition that came
4:08
out of the depression and they started
4:10
to get traction. But anyhow, we had to
4:12
resolve this political tension in
4:14
America. And frankly, it had to do it in
4:15
the world because the world also is
4:17
going through this juncture. And so from
4:19
1945 to 1970, we watched the great
4:23
post-war boom. Many people call it the
4:25
high point of global capitalism. And you
4:28
built this crazy economy where you did
4:30
many things that were completely
4:31
different than the previous era. Tax the
4:34
rich at 90%. You watched incredible
4:36
investment in public infrastructure like
4:38
the interstate highway system and
4:40
building suburbs. You basically watched
4:41
the GI Bill and education, building
4:44
institutions for higher education,
4:45
expanding it for the boomers. That all
4:47
happened in 25 years. was a great
4:48
society. The whole thing 25 years and
4:50
then we ran in the 70s. It started kind
4:51
of getting along in the tooth.
4:53
Stagflation, oil shocks. But here's the
4:55
point. Old system had to come down.
4:58
Super conflict around it. And ultimately
5:00
the building of a thing that was
5:01
dramatically different than before.
5:03
We've been through that before. And
5:04
funny enough, like I say, if you go
5:05
another 80 years back, we did it again.
Gilded age
5:13
It's 1865. What is 1865? It's the end of
5:17
the American Civil War. Now, this is a
5:20
good example of how passions run very
5:22
high and political conflict is extreme
5:25
at these junctures. And the Civil War
5:26
was the most extreme. I mean, we
5:28
literally had to have 750,000
5:31
Americans died in the Civil War. America
5:34
since the founding had been in tension
5:36
with these two economic systems. One was
5:39
essentially a system of the early
5:41
manufacturing economy where you needed
5:43
free labor in the north. But in the old
5:45
south, we basically had slavery and they
5:48
said, "No, we're not going there. We're
5:50
not going to give it up. We're not going
5:52
to let go of this old system. We're
5:53
going to fight to the death on the
5:54
thing." And so, this is a good example.
5:56
Anyone rooted in the old systems that
5:58
are going down are passionately want to
6:01
defend that at all cost. Now, the thing
6:03
that people do not know about the Civil
6:05
War or don't really remember as much
6:06
about the Civil War is the Civil War
6:08
after 1865 had an unbelievable explosion
6:12
of progress that lasted for what do you
6:14
know 25 years. For example, the
6:17
Homestead Act, which is you gave anybody
6:19
who went out west
6:21
150 acres for free. There was also land
6:25
grant universities. All these little
6:27
states started building institutes of
6:29
higher education to educate average
6:31
people but also to be pushing scientific
6:34
understanding of agriculture. But here's
6:36
the other progress that was going on. It
6:37
was technology. It was only after the
6:40
war that America blew out like 175,000
6:44
miles of rail and essentially stitched
6:46
the entire continent together with this
6:48
steelbased rails. And essentially we
6:50
reinvented America in 25 years. And
6:53
here's the even crazier thing though.
6:56
You go back another 80 years, we did it
6:58
again.
Founding era
7:04
1787 to about 1810, 1815, we had created
7:09
what is America. One way to understand
7:12
what was happening in America at that
7:14
time was it was part of a bigger part of
7:17
Western Europe and particularly an
7:18
extension of Britain which was going
7:20
through the enlightenment at the time.
7:22
The Enlightenment is essentially a
7:25
fundamental system change from a feudal
7:28
society kind of dominated by the
7:30
Catholic Church and all that kind of
7:31
stuff into essentially what we would now
7:33
consider the modern world. And they
7:36
invented six huge things that we still
7:40
are working within today. Now the reason
7:42
I'm kind of saying that is that had
7:44
world historic implications. That was a
7:48
building of a civilization that we
7:50
essentially invented. We humans but we
7:53
Western Europe in basically a space of
7:55
120 years. The forward motion of
7:58
innovation
7:59
essentially from the west was coming
8:01
with those crazy ass Americans who had
8:04
this wide open continent to spread it
8:06
to. And that is what America's role has
8:09
been visav the West in every one of
8:12
those epics. I'm arguing we have one
8:15
more crank of that wheel with the
8:17
arrival of three world historic changes
8:20
that are happening around us today. And
8:22
the most obvious one is the arrival of
The arrival of AI
8:24
artificial intelligence.
8:28
Chat GPT. Maybe you've heard of it. If
8:31
you haven't, then get ready because this
8:33
promises to be the viral sensation that
8:36
could completely reset how we do things.
8:39
The arrival of generative AI. With the
8:43
arrival of chat GBT 3.5 in November of
8:46
2022, I think we're going to see that as
8:48
a world historic moment. I think people
8:49
will look back on that is the starting
8:52
gun of what will be understood as the
8:54
age of AI. And I use age in a very
8:57
explicit way, which is when you talk
8:59
about a different age that humans enter
9:02
like, oh, the humans, you know, entered
9:04
the bronze age or the iron age. I mean,
9:06
you're talking about essentially a
9:08
fundamental gamechanging technology, a
9:11
breakthrough, a step change in our
9:13
abilities that once you cross that
9:15
threshold, you don't go back. We're
9:17
going to watch an explosion of
9:19
amplification. Our the amplification of
9:22
our mental powers with digital computers
9:24
and now AI are going to be very similar
9:26
to the amplification of our physical
9:28
powers that mechanical engines initially
9:30
by steam created the prosperity and
9:32
wealth of the world that we know now
9:34
where we're just going to say, "Holy
9:35
we had no idea this is the world
9:37
we're in.
The rise of clean energy
9:44
This is the first time we have an energy
9:47
source that is a technology. 100% a
9:51
technology, not a commodity. We don't
9:54
have to dig it up as coal. We don't have
9:56
to tap into it as oil. Why is that
9:59
important? Because once it's a
10:01
technology, you can consistently drive
10:04
down the cost. And there's a kind of a
10:07
rule of thumb in manufacturing which if
10:09
you double the number of producing solar
10:12
panels, you will come up with about 20%
10:14
of a drop in cost.
10:17
And this is the point, it's going to
10:18
keep getting cheaper. And the same thing
10:20
flipping around the same thing with
10:21
electric cars. People think, well,
10:22
electric cars are still expensive and
10:24
whatever. You're not thinking this
10:25
through because battery technology is
10:28
the same thing. That's in lithium
10:30
batteries. We're now getting whole
10:32
another generations of batteries like
10:33
solid state batteries that essentially
10:35
will be a next generation. But the point
10:37
is the forward motion of costs coming
10:40
down on clean energies is just
10:42
beginning. And when that happens, you're
10:43
going to have what? Abundant clean
10:46
energy.
The rise of bioengineering
10:55
basically right around the time that we
10:57
essentially had our earliest
10:58
breakthroughs on generative AI which is
11:01
about 15 years ago. We also had the big
11:03
breakthrough in what they call crisper
11:06
which is we figured out a way to cheaply
11:09
and easily edit the genome of any living
11:13
thing. And you just take one example. We
11:16
now know how to take a cell, put it in a
11:19
vat, and you can give it the same amino
11:22
acids and the same kind of nutrients and
11:24
the same things that a cow roaming
11:26
around a field for like years chewing on
11:29
grass would get those same nutrients,
11:31
the same amino acids, and essentially
11:33
would produce in their muscles, the
11:35
meat. That same thing can happen in a
11:38
vat to actually grow the same cow cell
11:42
into actual meat. Not like kind of meat,
11:45
not like plant-based meat that's kind of
11:47
like meat. It's meat. It's the same
11:50
cell. It tastes exactly the same. And
11:53
what's happened? We've only 25 years
11:55
ago. It's like 2003 was the first time
11:58
humans had ever cracked or understood
12:02
the human genome. Took three billion
12:05
dollars and it took 15 years to do it.
12:09
The cost of doing that from three
12:11
billion had been driven down so far it
12:13
was a thousand bucks. It's now at the
12:16
point where it's about a hundred bucks
12:18
and eventually it's going to keep
12:19
driving down to 50 bucks or nothing.
12:22
It's not just the same level. It is
12:24
twice as fast. We can now essentially
12:27
design these things for outcomes that we
12:30
want to happen cheaply and easily.
12:38
So the technology story of today, AI,
12:41
clean energies, even bioengineering is
12:43
kind of familiar at some level. The next
12:47
several iterations here though, I think,
12:49
is putting a bigger lens on what's going
12:51
on today. And it gets us back to what we
12:53
were describing is what's happening in
12:56
America is a once in 80 year
12:57
reinvention. And in fact, it's even
13:00
possible that what's going on here is
13:03
essentially the early days of building a
13:05
21st century civilization. And so when
13:08
you think about that, you go beyond the
13:10
technology. That's like the foundation.
13:12
And so the next thing up I think from
13:15
technologies, you start thinking, okay,
13:16
well, what could you build with those
13:18
technologies? What kind of an economy
13:20
would you want to build? The economic
13:23
system that the United States has been
13:25
based on that has worked for essentially
13:28
the top 10% for sure and certainly for
13:30
the top 1% has not been working for 80%.
13:33
And it's gotten to the point where they
13:35
just have had it. So, as crazy as it
13:39
sounds, we could be at a point in the
13:42
world right now in 2025 where we are
The beginning of a shift
13:45
watching the beginnings of a shift from
13:48
financial capitalism born and raised out
13:51
of the Enlightenment to essentially some
13:53
version of a sustainable capitalism.
13:56
We're going from a world of
13:58
representative democracy, which was a
14:00
brilliant move forward, to essentially a
14:03
digital democracy. And we're also going
14:06
to go from a world of nation states,
14:08
which again was a great breakthrough
14:10
from empires and colonies of the past,
14:12
to some kind of global governance that
14:15
coordinates the 10 billion people on
14:18
this planet. That's the level of change
14:20
I think we're actually heading into.
14:21
That's the level of change I think your
14:23
kids are going to be wrestling with. And
14:24
that's the level of change I think
14:26
America is going through now. And the
14:27
quicker we start to wrap our heads
14:29
around that challenge and and the kind
14:31
of scala of the invention we're up to,
14:33
the the better off we're all going to
14:34
be.
