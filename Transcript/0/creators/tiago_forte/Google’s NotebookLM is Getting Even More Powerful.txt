Introduction
0:00
Have you ever wished there was a way to
0:02
turn an endless social media dune scroll
0:04
into a learning session? Found an
0:06
interesting article? If only there were
0:08
a way to create a podcast and listen to
0:10
it on your commute home. Upload a bunch
0:12
of research papers and generate a video
0:14
presentation while you are making
0:16
dinner. There is a way. Here's what I'll
The Five Updates
0:20
cover in this video. five major updates
0:22
that shift Notebook LM from a notetaking
0:25
and productivity tool to a complete
0:28
learning and research platform. I'll
0:31
show you real demos of every single new
0:33
feature using my actual real projects,
0:36
no theoretical examples. Are you ready?
0:39
Let's dive in. You've probably seen
Video Overviews
0:41
Notebook LM's audio overviews feature,
0:44
which have gone massively viral over the
0:46
last year or so. But sometimes that's
0:48
not enough. Sometimes you need to not
0:51
only hear but see the data, the
0:54
diagrams, the quotes, the images. Here
0:56
we are in the notebook LM interface. I'm
0:59
going to go ahead and create a new
1:01
notebook where I can now add a new batch
1:03
of sources. So, I'll go ahead and click
1:06
add, and I'll open up this folder that I
1:09
have here on the side, which is all the
1:12
files and folders related to one of my
1:14
biggest current projects, which is a
1:16
book that I'm writing, which will come
1:17
out next year on the practice of an
1:20
annual life review. So, as I've been
1:22
doing research for my book, I've been
1:24
finding different academic papers and
1:26
research studies. But here's the thing,
1:28
I'm only about two months away from my
1:30
manuscript deadline. I don't really have
1:33
time to comb meticulously through new
1:36
research. I feel this pull like there
1:38
could be something interesting, an
1:39
anecdote, a story, a piece of data that
1:42
could support the arguments I'm making
1:43
in my book, but I just do not have time
1:46
to read them in the traditional way. So,
1:48
what I'm going to do is select all and
1:51
drag these five PDFs, all of which are
1:54
academic papers, into the sources
1:56
window. So the first thing I like to do
1:58
is just to click on each individual
2:00
source because it will generate this
2:02
little summary of just this one source.
2:04
So now I have just kind of a rough sense
2:06
of the diversity of topics that these
2:09
five sources cover. Moving on from the
2:11
sources panel here on the left, I'll go
2:13
ahead and close that so we have more
2:15
space. I could go straight to the chat
2:17
panel here in the middle and start
2:19
asking it questions. But as I think
2:21
about that, I don't even know which
2:23
questions to ask. I need a little more
2:25
context on what I'm working with here.
2:27
What is the what does the landscape of
2:30
information look like that's represented
2:32
by these five sources? So, let's
2:34
actually go all the way over here to the
2:36
studio panel. And you'll notice that
2:37
there's a new option right here called
2:39
video overview. So, what I'm going to do
2:42
is click the little edit icon and give
2:45
it a little bit of guidance. I'll do
2:47
this by holding down a key on my
2:49
keyboard and then just speaking because
2:50
I use a text transcription tool that's
2:53
also AI powered called Whisper Flow. So
2:56
that's what you'll see here. I'm writing
2:58
a book on annual life reviews including
3:01
why they're so important, how to do them
3:03
successfully, what they have to do with
3:05
achievement and productivity. Can you
3:07
please give me an overview and summary
3:09
of these five sources in video form so
3:12
that I can decide whether or not they
3:15
have any relevance to the book I'm
3:16
writing and whether I might be able to
3:18
include them as sources. There you go.
3:20
Then I'm going to hit generate. That
Generated Results
3:23
took about 10 or 15 minutes, but now I
3:25
can click on this video right here and
3:28
let's see what I came up with.
3:29
Welcome to the explainer. Today we're
3:32
going to talk about building something
3:34
really powerful. A framework for an
3:36
annual review that actually sticks. One
3:38
that can genuinely change your life. All
3:41
right, let's kick things off with a
3:43
quote that yeah, it might feel a little
3:44
too real for a lot of us. It's from a
3:47
2015 study on professional identity. And
3:50
man, does it nail that feeling that's
3:52
just so common in work culture today.
3:54
So, does that sound familiar? If you're
3:57
nodding your head right now, feeling
3:58
that constant tugofwar with work, then
4:00
you are absolutely in the right place.
4:03
That tension, that's our starting line
4:05
for figuring out how to build a more
4:06
intentional life. Okay, so let's dig
4:09
into this feeling because it turns out
4:11
it's not just you. It's a real thing.
4:13
And that right there is the big idea. An
4:16
annual life review is an act of
4:18
authorship. You are literally taking the
4:21
time to read the chapter that just ended
4:23
to really understand it and then to
4:24
consciously plot out the next one. So
4:27
what we've built here is a complete
4:29
architecture for a more intentional
4:31
life. It's a structure for reflection
4:33
that leads directly to action, which
4:36
leaves just one question for you. What
4:38
story are you going to write? And what's
4:40
the very first if then plan you're going
4:42
to create to start building it?
4:44
You can find a link to the full
4:45
presentation in the description below if
4:47
you want to check it out. What we just
4:49
witnessed is honestly one of the most
4:52
mind-blowing things I've seen. I can say
4:54
as someone who spent almost the last 2
4:56
years immersed in the topic uh that this
4:59
little video overview was about that
5:01
that was excellent. Think about what
5:03
just happened. I just threw five pretty
5:05
random papers. It not only summarized
5:08
those sources, but it linked them
5:10
together in a way that would have taken
5:12
any human many many hours at least. This
5:15
is such a powerful medium for learning
5:17
because visuals plus audio plus
5:20
narrative is really how humans have
5:22
shared knowledge for millennia. It's
5:24
such a more natural way for us to absorb
5:27
information than reading a cold, stale
5:30
document. But if you think about it,
Mobile App
5:32
most learning doesn't happen like this,
5:34
sitting quietly at a desk for hours at a
5:37
time with zero distractions. It happens
5:39
when you stumble across that interesting
5:41
article on your lunch break or you're
5:44
listening to a podcast while walking
5:46
your dog. As long as Notebook LM was
5:48
limited to desktop only, it really meant
5:51
missing most of these what I call
5:53
microlearning opportunities. But not
5:55
anymore. They now have a mobile app. All
5:59
right. So, let's say that I'm taking a
6:02
little break during my workday. Here's a
6:05
kind of infographic that caught my eye
6:07
about seven proven models for change
6:10
management. That's something I'm really
6:11
interested in these days. So, I'll go
6:13
ahead and tap it and then I'll hit the
6:15
share button down here at the bottom
6:17
right and then share via. And you can
6:20
see I now have the notebook LM app as
6:23
one of my share destinations. So, I'll
6:25
go ahead and tap that. So, you'll see
6:27
the first thing it asks me is which
6:29
notebook I want to add this to. So I
6:30
could easily add it to one of my
6:31
existing notebooks. But let's go ahead
6:33
and create a new one with the button
6:35
down at the bottom. You can see down
6:37
here at the very bottom of the screen,
6:38
it's the same three panels that you see
6:41
in the desktop version, which is
6:42
sources, chat, and studio. So I'll go
6:44
ahead and move over to the chat panel,
6:47
and just ask using the audio
6:49
transcription tool built into my
6:51
smartphone, what is the single most
6:54
effective method for change management
6:57
recommended by this source? and how
6:59
could I use it to help organizations
7:01
adopt AI and then hit send. So let's see
7:05
what it came up with. Interesting. So
7:07
the response is the source does not
7:09
recommend a single most effective method
7:12
for change management. It depends on the
7:14
suitability for the specific type and
7:16
size of the change initiative. That
7:18
actually makes a lot of sense. So I'm
7:20
glad that it kind of pushed back on me.
7:22
So let's go down a little bit and see
7:23
what it recommends for my specific
7:25
situation of helping organizations adopt
7:28
AI. So here we see for small behavioral
7:30
changes related to AI adoption,
7:33
encouraging employees to use a new AI
7:35
powered tool for a specific task, nudge
7:38
theory could be effective. So I could
7:39
ask more about that. For individual
7:41
performance changes, the ADCAR model
7:44
might be appropriate. So you can see
7:46
it's it's given me not just a single
7:48
recommended approach, but kind of a
7:50
buffet of different options that I could
7:52
try. This is really taking what was
7:54
originally a static piece of content
7:56
that was completely not customized to me
7:59
that someone posted on LinkedIn and
8:01
bringing it into my context, customizing
8:04
it and personalizing it for what I am
8:06
trying to accomplish, which just saves
8:08
me a tremendous amount of cognitive
8:10
effort, which is effort that I can then
8:12
put into actually implementing this
8:13
advice. So, this is fascinating. This is
8:16
already giving me some really concrete
8:17
examples, some practical takeaways that
8:20
I could take into my consulting with
8:21
companies. Let's try one more thing,
8:23
which is to head over to studio and go
8:26
ahead and generate an audio overview.
8:28
You can see right down here it says this
8:30
may take a few minutes, but there's no
8:32
need to stick around. So, I could put my
8:34
smartphone down. I could even exit the
8:36
Notebook Len app. I could lock my phone
8:39
and the system would keep generating in
8:41
the background, which is nice. That took
8:43
about 4 minutes and we can now listen to
8:45
it.
8:46
Okay, let's unpack this. Imagine pouring
8:48
I mean countless hours, huge energy,
8:52
significant resources into what you
8:54
really believe is a brilliant idea for
8:56
change.
8:56
Yeah. Something transformative.
8:58
Exactly.
8:58
So imagine how you could use this. You
9:00
generated this over five or 10 minutes
9:03
on your lunch break during work. You
9:05
could then on your commute back home
9:06
that same day spend the 10 or 11 minutes
9:10
it takes to listen to that podcast.
9:12
You've now successfully linked together
9:15
and integrated what were previously
9:17
these disconnected little bits of time
9:19
throughout your day into a cohesive
9:21
learning journey even though you don't
9:23
have hours to spend in your day. I hope
9:25
you can see through this that this
9:27
boundary between work time and learning
9:30
time is just completely dissolving. This
9:33
app is really bringing the power of
9:35
AIdriven learning and AIdriven research
9:38
to all those little microlearning
9:40
opportunities that you have throughout
9:42
the day and throughout the week where a
9:44
desktop or laptop computer just doesn't
Public Notebooks
9:46
fit. But this also raises a bigger
9:48
question. Why should it be so difficult
9:50
to find highquality reliable sources
9:53
especially when experts have already
9:56
organized that research for you? The
9:59
notebook LM team last year added the
10:01
ability to make a notebook public. What
10:05
you're seeing here is a featured
10:06
notebook. This is a publicly available
10:09
notebook that was put together by
10:11
best-selling author Eric Toppel, who is
10:13
a professor at Scripps and has written a
10:16
lot and researched about longevity. How
10:18
do you live long and how do you live
10:20
well? So, think about how valuable this
10:21
is. How long would it take you to go
10:24
individually and find and vet and add
10:27
each one of these sources? Instead, an
10:30
existing expert, in this case, Topel has
10:33
done it all for you. So, you can see
10:34
here it automatically creates a summary
10:37
of the collection of sources here in the
10:39
middle just to kind of orient you around
10:42
what you're looking at. But I have a
10:43
specific question which is I have quite
10:46
a bit of cancer history in my family in
10:49
both my parents and my grandparents.
10:52
What is Eric Toppel's best advice for
10:55
how I can live my life now in my 40s so
10:58
that I can avoid cancer for the rest of
11:01
my life? He underscores that no
11:03
intervention can offer a 100% guarantee
11:06
against cancer, but a comprehensive
11:08
lifestyle approach is his best advice.
11:11
So here you can see his advice around
11:14
diet, avoiding ultrarocessed foods,
11:16
limiting sugar, prioritizing good
11:19
carbohydrates and fiber. I'm already
11:21
realizing that this is comprehensive but
11:23
also a little bit overwhelming. So I
11:25
think I'm going to now draw on notebook
11:28
LM's broad knowledge of even other
11:31
topics beyond this notebook and ask
11:33
something very specific and practical. I
11:36
live in Mexico with my family and we
11:39
have someone who cooks lunch every day
11:41
for us in the afternoon. Could you
11:43
please give me a recipe list and a meal
11:47
plan for a full week of her cooking that
11:50
takes into account all the advice in
11:52
this chat? Okay, it's a set of
11:54
guidelines. So, it's summarizing the
11:56
guidelines up here, but then it has done
11:58
what I specifically asked, which is what
12:01
do we actually eat on Monday, on
12:03
Tuesday, on Wednesday. So, you can see
12:06
baked fish with roasted root vegetables,
12:09
black bean and quinoa bowl, chicken, and
12:11
colorful stir fry. I mean, this looks
12:13
honestly pretty delicious. I think I'll
12:15
even go one step further and say,
12:17
"Please get all of the meals described
12:19
in this meal plan. Identify every single
12:22
ingredient that I will need to prepare
12:24
them, and then put them into a grocery
12:26
list that is organized according to the
12:29
sections of a typical grocery store."
12:31
And there we go. We have produce
12:32
section, all the vegetables we'll need,
12:34
fruits, meat, and seafood counter,
12:36
dairy, pantry. What these public and
12:39
featured notebooks really mean is that
12:41
once someone has put together a
12:43
thoughtful, thorough collection of
12:45
sources on any topic anywhere in the
12:47
world, instead of having to sort of
12:49
passively listen to a podcast or watch a
12:51
YouTube video, you can go in like this
12:53
and interact with their entire body of
12:55
work in one central place. These sharing
12:58
capabilities mean that we can all now
13:01
kind of reallocate our time and effort
13:04
from knowledge gathering to knowledge
The BASB Notebook
13:07
synthesizing. Speaking of which, I've
13:10
actually taken advantage of the new
13:12
public sharing options to create an
13:14
official building a second brain
13:17
notebook. It includes all my books I've
13:19
written, all my articles, all my
13:21
podcasts, all my YouTube videos,
13:23
including ones like this one, and even
13:25
more that hasn't been public. which it's
13:28
taken me over a decade to research and
Source Discovery
13:30
produce. But there's still a bottleneck.
13:34
Even with expert curated notebooks like
13:36
this one, what happens when you need
13:38
sources for your specific project? The
13:41
hardest part of research or at least the
13:43
most consuming part has always been the
13:45
hunt, finding credible, highquality
13:48
resources in the first place. Notebook
13:50
LM now has a way for you to discover new
13:54
sources right within the interface. Let
13:57
me show you what that looks like. So,
13:58
I'll go ahead and create a new notebook.
14:01
And then you'll see there's a new button
14:03
right up here in the add sources little
14:06
dialogue window which says discover
14:08
sources. So, notice what's happening
14:10
here. Instead of having to open up a
14:12
dozen or two random tabs, instead of
14:14
having to do searches on Google or on
14:17
YouTube or look on social media or
14:20
wherever you find your sources, you can
14:22
just do it right here. So for my book on
14:24
annual reviews, I recently heard about a
14:27
concept called infraian rhythms. So I'd
14:30
like to know more about that. So I'll go
14:32
ahead and ask it. Find highquality
14:35
researchbacked sources about infraian
14:38
rhythms, including multi-day, weekly,
14:42
monthly, and yearly time scales. Try to
14:45
find anything that might be relevant and
14:47
useful for a book that I'm writing on
14:49
annual life reviews. All right, so you
14:52
can see that just took about 20 seconds
14:55
and it's curated around 10 different
14:58
sources. I think it usually defaults to
15:00
10. So, you can either just go ahead and
15:03
leave all the boxes checked. You could
15:05
also uncheck certain ones if you don't
15:06
think they're relevant. And to know
15:08
whether they're relevant, you can just
15:10
click this button right here, and it
15:12
will open the original source in a new
15:14
window. These all look pretty valid to
15:16
me. You can see it's a mix of web pages,
15:19
blog posts, as well as YouTube videos,
15:21
which is nice. I'll go ahead and hit
15:23
import. All right, that took about 30
15:26
seconds. And now that these are loaded
15:29
into the main notebook element
15:31
interface, I can click on each one as I
15:33
usually do and just get a little summary
15:35
of what these are about. So just based
15:38
on that, this looks like a really
15:39
excellent selection of sources. This
15:41
summary here in the middle is also a
15:44
summary of all 10 sources. So if I
15:46
didn't want to go in individually, I
15:47
could just get a, you know, an overview
15:49
of the entire group of them all at once.
15:51
But I think the first thing I'm going to
15:53
do since I'm I'm still trying to just
15:55
wrap my head around this collection of
15:57
sources that it's discovered is to click
16:00
each one of the studio types. Audio
16:02
overview, let's do a video overview.
16:05
Let's do a mind map. And let's do a
16:09
briefing doc. So, at this point, I would
16:11
probably step away, go have lunch, go
16:13
for a walk, maybe do some exercise, and
16:15
just let my AI research assistant go and
16:18
create each of these different types of
16:20
outputs. All right, so the briefing doc
Outline Generation
16:23
was ready the soonest, which is usually
16:25
the case. This sounds really
16:27
fascinating. So, I actually now want to
16:29
see if AI can help me understand how all
16:33
of this research, which is really quite
16:34
extensive, might be directly applicable
16:37
to the book I'm writing. So, I think
16:39
what I'll do is convert it to source by
16:41
clicking this button right here. And you
16:42
can see it was added right there. And
16:44
then I think what I'll do is actually
16:46
deselect all the other sources and only
16:49
select that one. And then I can ask it,
16:52
can you tell me ideas for how this
16:54
research and these findings might be
16:57
relevant and useful in a book I'm
16:59
writing on annual life reviews? And
17:01
there we go. So, it's given me several
17:03
ideas. Uh, integrating multi-year life
17:06
cycles. That is something I had not
17:07
considered that I could definitely
17:08
incorporate. So this is excellent. And
17:11
in fact, I even want to go beyond this
17:13
now. So what I'm going to do to kind of
17:15
do even one more of those passes, one
17:17
more of those loops, is let's go ahead
17:19
and remove all these research sources
17:21
because we've sort of summarized and
17:23
distilled them pretty well. Then what
17:25
I'm going to do is do another round of
17:28
discovering sources. This time though,
17:30
I'll search Google Drive and I think
17:33
make the scope of what I'm looking for a
17:35
little broader. search my Google Drive
17:37
and find any potential source that's
17:40
related to our relationship to time or
17:43
the impact of different rhythms or
17:46
patterns in time on human psychology or
17:50
motivation or cognition. So, this is
17:53
interesting. It's finding um the outline
17:56
of the current book that I'm writing.
17:57
So, I think I'll actually unselect that.
17:59
But I'm seeing some of my Readwise
18:01
highlights from books I've read, some
18:03
highlights and excerpts from the book
18:05
The Body Keeps the Score, which I hadn't
18:07
considered relevant to this. Some blog
18:09
posts I've written, which could have
18:11
some of my personal story anecdotes and
18:13
writing samples that I've done in the
18:15
past. So, that seems interesting.
18:17
All right, that took a few minutes
18:19
because a couple of these sources are
18:21
hundreds of thousands of words long. But
18:24
now what I'm going to do since I have
18:26
another batch of sources is say draft an
18:29
outline for a chapter in my book that is
18:32
all about the science and research of
18:36
humans relationship to time and how
18:39
rhythms at different scales including
18:41
hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly
18:45
have an impact on how we think, feel,
18:48
and perform. And there we go. The
18:50
rhythms of life. understanding our
18:51
relationship with time, self, and
18:53
performance. So, I'm going to go ahead
18:55
and close these two other panels so that
18:58
I can see looks like one section is an
19:01
introduction, time, our most elusive
19:03
dimension, the micro rhythms, the mess
19:06
rhythm. So, it's broken it up into kind
19:08
of small, medium, and large size
19:11
rhythms, which makes a lot of sense.
19:13
Wow. Excellent. What this really means
19:15
is that the research bottleneck is
19:17
shifting. The question which has been
19:20
the question for so many years and
19:21
decades and centuries which is where is
19:24
the good information? Can I get my hands
19:26
on the good information? that has
19:29
shifted now to what unique insights,
19:33
what unique perspective, what unique
19:35
angle can I extract or distill from this
19:39
information based on what's unique to
19:41
me, my life history, my existing
19:44
knowledge and expertise, my way of
19:45
seeing the world or of seeing this
Mind Maps
19:48
subject. But here's what happens next.
19:50
You've got all these highquality
19:52
credible sources, but once again,
19:54
there's a new different problem. You
19:57
can't see how they connect. You're
19:58
reading them still in a way linearly one
20:01
at a time, quickly forgetting what you
20:03
just read in the previous one and
20:05
therefore potentially missing patterns
20:07
and connections between them. Sometimes
20:09
your brain needs to zoom out from the
20:12
nitty-gritty details to the big picture
20:14
so that you can then know which details
20:17
you want to zoom back into. This is
20:19
where interactive mind maps are so
20:21
incredibly useful. Let's use the example
20:24
of the notebook we were just looking at
20:26
about the rhythms in human life. You can
20:29
see a few things. First of all, it's
20:30
somewhat interactive. You can click and
20:33
drag the mind map around and then it's
20:36
broken down for you what are the main
20:38
subtopics, the main parts of this big
20:42
topic called biological rhythms. So,
20:44
let's say I want to know more about one.
20:46
For example, seasonal cycles in human
20:48
psychology. You can see that it kind of
20:50
opens up and shows me the next layer of
20:52
subtopics. Every time you see one of
20:54
these little right-facing arrows, that
20:56
means you can click it and see another
20:58
layer of detail. So, let's see.
21:00
Cognitive performance. That's the one
21:02
I'm most interested in. And it looks
21:04
like we end up with really specific
21:06
concrete examples like Alzheimer's,
21:08
seasonal effective disorder. I'm
21:10
actually most interested since my book
21:12
is not really about um medical
21:14
conditions. I'm interested in healthy
21:16
adults and how their attention might
21:18
shift. So, if I click on that sub
21:21
subtopic, it actually opens up a new
21:24
chat that is specifically related to
21:27
that thing that I clicked. It looks like
21:29
uh it's giving me a bit more detail,
21:31
which is even in healthy adults,
21:34
sustained attention and working memory
21:36
varies uh their cognitive performance
21:39
varies according to the seasons. It
21:41
looks like it's based on meteorological
21:43
changes like sunlight and temperature,
21:45
but also ecological factors. So my
21:48
question here is, what time of year is
21:52
cognitive performance the highest in
21:54
humans on average? Interesting. So it
21:56
looks like in healthy adults, at least
21:58
the sources that I have so far do not
22:00
specify what time of year, cognitive
22:02
functions are best, but in Alzheimer's
22:04
patients, their symptoms are more severe
22:07
in the winter and early spring. So
22:10
interesting. I've reached a little bit
22:11
of a dead end, at least in terms of what
22:13
I am trying to learn. But this could
22:15
absolutely be the starting point of a
22:17
whole another loop, right? I could click
22:19
right here and say save to note. So you
22:21
can see it saves that response as a
22:23
note. I could then convert it to a
22:25
source. And then I could even do another
22:27
round of discovering sources and try to
22:29
find sources that do indicate what time
22:32
of year cognitive performance is
22:34
highest. Now you've seen the five major
Other Features
22:36
updates, but before we talk about when
22:38
to use them strategically, let me just
22:40
rapid fire through some kind of smaller
22:43
changes that also do affect how you'll
22:45
actually implement this. New audio
22:48
overview types. So you can now choose a
22:50
deep dive mode where it really gets deep
22:53
into the details. You can choose a brief
22:55
mode if you want something short and
22:56
quick. You can use a critique where it's
22:59
actually criticizing and trying to
23:01
disprove the content of the sources or
23:04
you can use a debate format where
23:06
there's two people debating back and
23:07
forth. You can choose the length of the
23:10
audio overview that you want, short,
23:12
medium, or long. There is now a student
23:15
version of Notebook LM that is designed
23:17
to be used in educational settings like
23:19
schools, which has stricter privacy for
23:22
minors. It doesn't train on the data
23:24
that you put into it ever. And they even
23:27
have a $9.99 per month student discount
23:29
that you can use to get this more
23:31
affordably. And last but not least, it
23:33
can now work with PDFs. You can either
23:36
upload the PDF in its entirety or you
23:38
can just provide a link and it will go
23:40
find the contents of that PDF itself.
NotebookLM vs Other AI Tools
23:42
Now, zooming out for a second, here's
23:44
the strategic question that determines
23:47
whether this actually changes how you
23:50
work and how you study. When should you
23:52
use Notebook LM instead of an LLM such
23:56
as say chat GPT or CLOD? There's really
23:59
three very specific scenarios in which
24:02
Notebook LM beats ChatGpt or Claude. The
24:05
first is when working with massive
24:07
information sets. Notebook LM is based
24:10
on Gemini which has a 25 million token
24:14
context. when you have a lot of
24:16
documents, a lot of data that you're
24:18
trying to dump in there, Notebook LM is
24:20
a great choice. The second scenario is
24:22
when accuracy and precise citations
24:26
really matter. If you're doing any kind
24:28
of highstakes work, whether it's in
24:29
science or in health or it's for a test
24:32
or it's for a client, and you really
24:34
need to know that the responses it's
24:37
giving you are correct, that it's not
24:39
hallucinating, and you need to be able
24:41
to click a citation and verify for
24:44
yourself that it's correct. Notebook LM
24:46
is one of the best, if not the best AI
24:49
tool that is really source grounded.
24:51
They don't try to hide sources. They
24:53
don't try to make you forget about where
24:55
this is coming from. They actually make
24:57
sources first class citizens in your
25:00
work with AI which is really rare I
25:02
found among other AI tools. And third,
25:05
Notebook LM is I would say the best
25:08
choice these days if you learn best
25:11
through audio or visual mediums. There
25:14
are other AI tools that have visual and
25:16
audio formats, but you kind of have to
25:18
piece them together. You have to do some
25:20
custom stuff. You have to move content
25:22
from one place to another. Notebook LM
25:24
is almost the only one that has all of
25:27
that integrated into a single very
25:29
userfriendly interface. But here's the
The CODE Method Still Applies
25:31
deeper principle that I think Notebook
25:33
LM is built on. Your unique collection
25:36
of information, your information, your
25:39
notes, your thoughts, your ideas, your
25:42
research has become more valuable in the
25:46
age of AI, not less. Notebook LM and
25:49
similar tools actually represent the
25:51
evolution that I predicted way back in
25:53
my book building a second brain. We're
25:55
increasingly moving from collecting
25:57
information to cultivating insights. The
26:00
code method that I first formulated
26:02
years ago is still just as valid. I
26:05
would say even more valid than before.
26:07
You have to capture information. You
26:09
have to organize it. You have to distill
26:11
it with the help of notebook LM and
26:13
other AI tools. And eventually at some
26:16
point you really need to express it. All
26:18
of that can now happen at AI speed. Your
26:21
current knowledge isn't being replaced
26:23
by AI. It's being amplified by it.
Foundation Systems
26:26
Notebook LM is a very powerful tool. But
26:28
to truly transform how you work with
26:31
information. You need some foundational
26:33
systems in place first. Things like how
26:35
to manage your to-do list, how to handle
26:37
your email, how to organize your digital
26:40
world, and even just take notes
26:42
effectively. I've created a
26:44
comprehensive playlist on digital
26:46
productivity and information management
26:48
that walks you through all the key
26:51
strategies from streamlining your daily
26:53
workflows to implementing frameworks
26:56
like my parah method to building project
26:58
management skills that give you real
27:01
control and focus. The future belongs to
27:04
those who can combine systematic
27:07
information management with AI
27:08
augmentation. What I recommend is that
27:11
you start with these systems and then
27:13
you supercharge them with AI. Subscribe
27:15

27:17
me on exactly how to do that.
