If you think about the companies in the space industry that make a lot of money, it's like satellite internet, imaging,
0:05
GPS, companies and use cases that are using space as a platform. What if you could do that same thing with physical
0:12
cargo? The first month we spent looking to see who else was doing. We couldn't conceive that this wasn't a thing. This
0:18
is not just an increment. This will rewrite fundamentally how we think about accessing the globe in the same way a
0:24
century ago the aircraft did. This is Justin Fetti and he is the
0:31
co-founder and CEO of Inversion. Uh and they are allowing people to just basically drop uh payloads from space in
0:38
under an hour. Um do you want to just talk about why that is important? Yeah, absolutely. And so thank you for
0:43
having me. Super super hyped to chat today. Um, so at Inversion, we build re-entry vehicles that allow focused
0:51
mainly on the military uh for payloads to be stored in orbit for up to 5 years and then called down to anywhere on
0:57
Earth in under an hour, right? And land softly under parachute. Um, the real kind of core for why we're doing this
1:03
here at Inversion is uh making the world more accessible. Um we we talk a lot
1:09
about uh in the kind of defense side of stuff, how do you access remote areas,
1:17
right? Logistics is always been determined as the way that a battle or or a war is won. Um
1:24
going back to like Napoleon. Yeah. Like I mean even further behind that, right? Like it is across human
1:30
history that that is the case. Um and a century ago, humanity took a step with
1:35
the aircraft, right? that was introduced allowed people to move cargo and effects
1:41
and people faster and further than they were able to before. Um, and we want to
1:46
help take that next step. And to do that, we have to use space, right? Space is an incredible platform that allows
1:54
you to access the whole globe. Right? If you think about the companies in the space industry that make a lot of money,
2:01
right? It's it's like Starlink with satellite internet. It's imaging. It's
2:06
GPS, TV channel. Yeah, it's all of these companies and use cases that are using space as a
2:12
platform to access back down on the globe. Uh and so my co-founder and I realized that when we were working in the launch
2:18
industry. Uh and we asked the question, okay, what if you could do that same thing but with physical cargo, right?
2:26
Physical access to the globe rather than just digital access to the globe. Um and that's what we found an inversion to go
2:32
and do. Uh and so we've been working on uh on this for about coming up on five years. Uh we launched our first demo
2:38
mission earlier this year. Uh fully built in-house spacecraft. Um uh was that the Ray?
2:44
That was Ray. Yeah. So about I don't know 2 ft wide or so, you know, about that big. Um built with just 25 people.
2:52
Built every system in house because that led to our main product which we actually just recently announced named
2:58
ARC. Uh and Arc is a 4 foot wide, 8 foot tall. It's right there in the background. Right there.
3:03
Uh lifting body re-entry vehicle. Um you know, kind of the world's first space-based delivery vehicle, uh
3:11
specifically focused on, uh cargo delivery for the DoD. Yeah. And so for Ry, uh you start in
3:17
like 2021 and you're basically grinding away for roughly four years before you're actually able to ship something into space and like test it uh in the
3:24
real world for the first time. Um what were you trying to get out of that mission? Yeah. So, um, yeah, we we
3:30
founded the company in January of 2021. Uh, we then went through YC summer 21,
3:35
raised our seed round in like September, Octoberish time frame, uh, of 21. Um, so
3:41
then then everything kind of kicked off. Um, started hiring, started building out the facility. Uh, uh, and you know,
3:48
starting from a garage, there's a lot to go and do. Um, we then, so Ry initially
3:54
was actually planning to launch earlier than January. Um, we were ready to go
3:59
for the SpaceX Transporter 12 mission, which I believe was slated for like
4:04
August of 2020. Uh, that would have been 24. Yeah. Yeah. August 24. Um, and then there was
4:12
a series of reasons that that launch got delayed which sent us up in January. So,
4:17
um, but it was it was useful because we got to do even more testing on the ground, that kind of stuff. Um the whole goal for Ry was around like the
4:25
learnings that you get from a first vehicle, right? Uh that's both from a company perspective and from an actual
4:31
technology perspective. Uh the amount of processes you build, the operations in orbit, uh testing out specific
4:38
subsystems that go directly onto the arc vehicle. uh for example like the software, the GNC, the attitude control
4:46
thrusters and all that whole system translates pretty directly to the arc vehicle. Um and so it was very much
4:53
about this like move quick. How do we get product in the hands of customers or physics as fast as possible, right? And
4:59
and you at least get something like in the real world being tested sort of situation. Yeah, exactly. Like you learned so much
5:05
just from getting to space. Um and and uh we've learned a ton from that and have taken a lot of those lessons and
5:11
now ARC's development is probably about like 2 years faster because of that. Um
5:18
there's so many things you can then you can learn and shortcut at least we found things that we were able to now shortcut
5:24
um or not have to do because we did them on Ray and know that they will work. What were those things?
5:29
Uh there's a few different places that that's applicable. Um some of it comes from like the sequencing of development.
5:37
Um you know a lot of times you'll kind of like build everything and then test it at the end or like that's the traditional way. Uh nowadays like a lot
5:44
more people are building and testing as they go. Um a place we've put like a tremendous amount of effort and
5:51
resources is actually in our simulation uh like stack within the company. Um a
5:56
lot of folks will probably be familiar with like hardware in the loop testing or or software in the loop testing. um
6:02
that you know used to kind of be like okay a final validation at the end. Um
6:07
we've built out uh infrastructure within the company that allows us to test on like a daily basis. We we run nightlys
6:15
even already. So nightly like that's where overnight we will run a full mission simulation or you know hundreds
6:21
of them um with varying different inputs you know testing okay what if we have GPS fallout what if we have uh
6:28
a bunch of different scenarios all sorts of stuff we're able to get that data ingest it in the morning when
6:33
we walk into the office iterate again and then run again the next night um you
6:39
know with a with a re-entry vehicle a lot of people think you know about aerodynamics and that's kind of a key
6:44
thing for arc is its unique aerodynamics that allow it to glide in the hypersonic regime, you know, maneuver during
6:51
re-entry when it's coming back from orbit down to the ground. Um, and the
6:56
specific type of aerodynamics being a lifting body, it's it's uh a relatively
7:02
limited uh body of work that exists for lifting bodies. Um, you know, they were
7:09
really done a lot in the 60s, brought back a little bit in the 90s, and then we're kind of bringing them back with modern technology. Uh, but the amount
7:16
of, uh, aerodynamic simulation we can do today, uh, and the quality of our
7:21
predictions makes wind tunnel testing substantially less valuable to the
7:27
company. It's still useful, don't get me wrong. Um, but it is it can be pushed later. It can be done less. it can be
7:34
done at a lower expense because uh turns out when you go to the wind tunnels they
7:40
tell you yeah your simulations are plus or minus 10%. And like that's what it is
7:45
going to be or you know for the most part unless there's something specific that creeps up. Um and so so you can do
7:51
a lot more you can do a lot more learnings and iteration early on with simulation than you would have even been able to do 10 years ago. Um and that's
7:57
really helped speed things up for us on that test with Ry. I know the only thing that kind of didn't work was like
8:04
engine restarting correct and so what were the like main goals for that like even on the engine restart what
8:10
were you trying to you know figure out with that yeah yeah absolutely so we built the engine the igniter the uh you know the
8:16
whole system in house uh the one of the parts we didn't build which was like a small component on the uh on one of the
8:23
boards um the board worked great the component failed which is frustrating uh meant we were not able to ignite our
8:30
torchign igniter, which meant we couldn't ignite the the main engine. Um uh you know, that would have been the
8:37
first of I believe two burns to then bring us back and land uh off the coast of California. Um we then proceeded to
8:44
basically demonstrate the system minus that pure ignition, right? being able to do an orbit lowering and orbit raising
8:51
maneuver, showing the uh proper control algorithms, uh the proper um being able
8:58
to determine our attitude of the spacecraft very very accurately to make sure we were burning in the right direction, all that kind of stuff. So,
9:06
um had there been ignition, I think we would have had a high likelihood of uh
9:11
putting the re-entry capsule portion of Ray on a trajectory that is desirable.
9:16
Right now, unfortunately, we didn't get to test what happens after that, right? Uh uh were the aerodynamics designed
9:23
properly? Did the uh parachutes deploy and properly uh splash down in the ocean? Um luckily though, a lot of those
9:32
components and a lot of those systems have a lot of heritage around them or
9:37
can be tested very well outside of the full flight environment. Right? So, for
9:43
example, with the parachute system, we're able to go and test the parachutes
9:48
at the exact dynamic pressures, exact uh um uh altitudes, etc. that we would see
9:55
in flight. Um, and so we can go do that, validate those systems work well, and we
10:00
do that during qualification, making sure to hit both the high dynamic pressure and low dynamic pressures we would expect to see.
10:06
How do you actually do that? So, there's a few different ways you can do it. Um we do it through uh drop
10:12
testing out of aircraft. Yeah. Um and uh interestingly when we want to test a low
10:18
dynamic pressure opening of the parachute, right? Does the canopy the parachute canopy inflate when there's
10:24
not very much air flow trying to inflate it, right? But we the way we tested actually is we uh we brought a test
10:32
configuration onto a hot air balloon uh and we actually just dropped it over the side
10:38
because you have no vertical velocity, right? So you have the worst case scenario you could possibly have. Uh and
10:44
then high dynamic pressure actually requires us to put our aircraft in a bit of a dive to get a higher air speed. You
10:51
just throw it out the back or uh we we um we static line deploy it out
10:56
of the back. Um and so you get this super high shock loading uh for um the
11:03
parachute inflating at a very high velocity and that can replicate the dynamic pressure you would see in flight. Um so and then on the kind of
11:11
thermal protection material side and the aerodynamics side like I mentioned there's a lot of both heritage in the
11:17
materials coming from NASA as who we have a partnership with uh but also the ability to simulate and model that quite
11:23
closely. Uh and and with Ray, you know, the aerodynamics did not translate to ARC, right? Arc has completely novel
11:30
aerodynamics. Um and so we were definitely, you know, it's definitely a bummer working a lot on on Ray uh uh to
11:37
not get it back, but I think we got probably across the whole program, I'd say we probably got 90 to 95% of the
11:45
possible learnings um that could happen, which was the whole goal of the vehicle. Yeah. I mean, I think 95% of the
11:50
possible learnings is basically like the best case scenario where like most things go well and if one thing like
11:56
doesn't go well, then that's awesome. Totally. Yeah. Totally. Um, so when you first like started out,
12:01
I know that with this sort of thing, it's it's very like long feedback loops. Like you don't actually get to test the
12:06
first thing in space until like three and a half, four years inish. And then also like occasionally SpaceX just can't
12:13
launch a rocket on time or maybe you get bumped to the next launch window or something like that. um how are you kind
12:19
of thinking about moving quickly and getting the first thing done even while having you know a thousand plus day
12:26
window? Yeah. Um so there there's a few different
12:32
iteration cycles that we think about. Um technical iteration,
12:38
product iteration, go to market iteration, um there's probably a couple
12:44
others, but those are kind of the three main ones. And I guess customer iteration which fits somewhat in between product and go to market. Um technical
12:52
technical iteration happens like we talked about a lot on the day-to-day,
12:58
right? Like being able to test in simulation, you know, going out to our Mojave Desert test site to be able to
13:03
run actual hardware. Um we like to build and iterate as quick as possible, right?
13:09
uh starting with as flight representative hardware as possible that we can get in
13:16
the compressed time frame we want to get it testing it learning iterating and being able to get a few cycles in of
13:22
design. Um the product iteration I think is maybe more interesting to talk about
13:29
because you know how do you build a product that you kind of have to predict
13:35
the future call call your shot at least for years ahead of the time with budget
13:41
cycles that take years to happen with customer needs that you know won't be
13:47
fulfilled for years right with AI and all the software companies you Okay, I I
13:53
I test it. I see if users love it and then if they don't, I iterate tomorrow and then I try another thing.
13:59
Like a two week, one week, maybe same day iteration loop, whereas this is like a year, two years.
14:04
Exactly. And so we try to solve that in two ways. Um the first is the old YC
14:11
adage of talk to your customers, right? like go talk to the endusers that are
14:17
going to get the delivery or are going to buy the product or are planning out the strategy for how an improved
14:24
logistics solution could help them uh in the real world. And so you know we're talk we we're talking with customers
14:30
every single day. Um and you know we're we're constantly tuning the product in different ways to meet customer
14:37
feedback. You know, one of the things we heard early on uh was cost, right? This, you know, you hear about storing in
14:44
space and it's like that's going to be expensive as hell. Um and and we we kind of took that feedback and you know, the
14:51
reality of it today is it's actually cheaper, it will be cheaper to store cargo in orbit and deliver it down to
14:58
the ground anywhere on Earth than it is to have that same cargo accessible anywhere on Earth.
15:04
Right? Because uh to have it accessible anywhere on Earth, stored terrestrially, you need to have hundreds and hundreds
15:10
of warehouses manned by people with aircraft with uh uh you know runways and
15:16
treaties and shipping logistics to get all your food and stuff like like it is this massive logistics web that has been
15:23
built out to have that access, right? hundreds and hundreds of units versus we
15:28
can condense that, put it in orbit um and have tens of units to have access to
15:34
the same uh place. Now, you know, at the moment that's not a good strategy for
15:41
high um volume goods, right? Like you know, you're using uh you know um things
15:49
you use all the time like like uh uniforms as an example. Like we're not going to store uniforms in space. that
15:54
doesn't make any sense. Um, but the the things that you need very fast, you don't know where you're going to need them, that makes a lot of sense. And so,
16:02
you know, talking with customers, learn, hearing about what their needs are and stuff has, uh, for example, driven the
16:08
aerodynamics of Ark. Um, we wanted to make it so that as few of vehicles as
16:13
possible were needed to cover a geographic area. And that's kind of what led us to the lifting body geometry,
16:20
right? It provides substantial access to the ground, right? Uh over a thousand
16:26
kilometers of cross range either direction, which allow it to kind of glide multiple different places from its
16:32
single orbit. Um which lets us keep the cost really low for customers when they have a specific type of cargo they want to
16:38
access down on the ground. Um and then so so that was number one which is talk to go talk to your customers you know
16:45
listen to what they have to say and and and you find a useful piece of information you can iterate on your product with. Um the second though is
16:53
because the time horizons for uh these types of products are f are longer than
17:00
your traditional software products. Um, we tried to look at what are things we
17:05
know to be true that will be true in 15 years will be Jeff Bezosism where he's
17:11
just like what's not going to change in the next 10 years sort of situation. Exactly. Right. Um, and my question is
17:17
what's not going to ever change for humanity, right? Like you know what is going to be
17:22
true what was true a thousand years ago and what will be true a thousand years from now? Um, and we we try to base core
17:31
decisions off of those types of structural uh truths, right? A structural truth is
17:38
that humans always want to access more of the globe faster, right? We have that
17:45
has always been the case and that will never cease to be the case. Um, and we
17:51
that is where you can kind of put a foundation for the company together and say, you know, our mission is to make
17:57
Earth radically more accessible by making space a transportation layer. Um,
18:02
and so that structural truth is helpful, right? Cost is another and that's a good Bezos one, right? He's always talking
18:07
about uh people aren't going to want less selection, slower delivery. Exactly. And good selection. No one
18:14
wants that. Exactly. No one wants that. And so, you know, uh, the military always wants to
18:21
be able to, uh, operate inside their adversaries decision loop,
18:27
right? You know, the udal loop is is the phrase. But, you know, put simply, if I can if I'm a boxer and you're a boxer
18:34
and I can dodge you and punch you faster than you can dodge and punch me, you're going to win, right? Or or I'm going to
18:40
win rather. And and then the final one is the final kind of structural truth is
18:45
that space is really great at giving access to the globe and it always will be. Um that is a
18:52
fundamental uh value or or or characteristics of of that platform. Um just like a
18:59
fundamental characteristic of the internet is that you can distribute information fast and and and quite
19:06
cheaply. And so if we believe those kind of three things that gives us the foundation for what types of products to
19:12
build um uh and where to go over that
19:19
medium term. Yeah. So especially for like the first few that you're going to throw up there,
19:24
how what did people kind of come back and say this is what would be super valuable to be able to get in under an
19:30
hour in these different geographic locations? Yeah. Um, so there there's some stuff we
19:36
can't talk about quite yet. Um, and hopefully we'll be able to talk about it soon, but it it generally falls into the
19:43
category of mission enabling cargo or effects like things that make the difference in the moment. Um,
19:50
that be like food and like medical supplies, that kind of thing or that kind of thing or like uh communication systems or sensors, ISR,
19:59
like that kind of world. Um, an important thing to think about is like
20:05
it's not necessarily about the uh cost of the good you're delivering, but
20:10
rather what is the value of the impact it has? Um, because if it can help make
20:16
a mission successful that couldn't have been successful otherwise, well, that's profoundly valuable. That's what we look
20:23
at today. What we look at for tomorrow or you know kind of the future is how do
20:30
behaviors change when this is real, right? When you can rely on one hour
20:35
delivery anywhere on Earth, how do behaviors change for our customers? Uh and what that starts to look like is
20:42
more freedom to go further away from your existing supply chain or your existing base of operations. um more
20:50
flexibility in smaller teams that can be supported without massive logistics chains. Um there's a story about how the
20:59
F-17 Nighthawk, which is the first stealth uh stealth aircraft that the US used in uh in operation,
21:07
uh not only was it awesome because it was a, you know, stealth aircraft that could get through any enemy radar, but
21:13
what it also meant was uh the military didn't need to have
21:19
dozens of aircraft surrounding it because the way they used to have it was they would send in uh they would
21:24
basically send in like decoy drones to get or like you know missile cannon fight sort of situation. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. You know to get to
21:32
for the enemy radars to light up so that then the next wave of aircraft could come and hit those radars so that the
21:38
next wave of aircraft could come so then finally the bombers could come right and the the advent of stealth allowed for
21:47
that m I think it was like 32 aircraft I forget the exact number um to be reduced down to one. So you can cost like that
21:54
one can cost a lot more but it's still way more efficient than the way more efficient and way more effective. And so when you don't need to
22:01
have dozens of people, aircraft, you know, trucks all supporting the
22:06
logistics of this one mission and you can have these systems, both cargo and
22:12
autonomous systems deployed, your behavior starts to change and you start to plan differently and you start to
22:17
operate differently. um in the same way that uh aircraft allowed for that in
22:23
World War II where now we can drop people behind enemy lines, which was never a thing beforehand, right? You
22:30
couldn't support with airdrops. You couldn't um you know, you couldn't affect things outside the reach of
22:36
either ground or artillery from uh from from boats. And so like that's a really
22:43
exciting place to be where behavior changes and customers start relying on
22:48
your products. Um and you know I think we'll see that really start to take hold
22:53
over the next couple years. Yeah. I I think for this sort of thing it just wouldn't have been possible
22:59
prior to like rapid rocket reusability. Um, and I know that you used to work at SpaceX and uh, was this one of the
23:06
situations where you're working there and you're seeing like the launch cost go down and then you're kind of like, you know, extrapolate that out a few
23:12
years and suddenly a business like this becomes viable. So, um, launch cost is definitely one of
23:19
the big inputs for us. I I would actually argue that it's less about the cost and more about the mass to orbit.
23:26
Mhm. Um like until Falcon started flying regularly.
23:31
We actually Austin and I were just talking about this today. Austin my co-founder. Um I believe today SpaceX
23:37
just flew their lifeleading booster for the 31st time and like that's awesome
23:44
from a cost perspective. Um from a price perspective the price of you know Falcon
23:49
has been I think roughly stable over the last couple years, right? two different demand is kind of just, you know,
23:54
well, demand demand keeps going up, right? Exactly. But imagine trying to build 31 boosters,
24:02
right? You know, uh uh that the amount of time and people and and resources and
24:09
money would required to do that is unbelievable. And so I think the real
24:14
the one of the big unlocks that's maybe a bit underappreciated with reusability
24:19
of rockets is and Elon talks about this so it's nothing new but is is the production uh
24:25
is the limited footprint of production you need compared to what you would have to do otherwise and so when when you
24:32
have launches going up regularly not only does that make it cost effective for us to go and build this
24:39
type of business in space um Uh but it lets us ride the wave of cost reduction,
24:46
right? So it works today and it's only going to be better later. Um and it gives us and investors and customers uh
24:56
confidence that there will be a ride to space, right? You don't have to worry that you know how are you going to get
25:01
onto a space shuttle mission? Like do you know what forms you have to fill out? Like no. I just go on like SpaceX's website,
25:10
put in my credit card and call it good, right? Uh so I think Reuse has done a lot.
25:18
I think it will continue to do more. Um I don't think we've seen
25:23
the true rate of price reductions that are possible with reuse because there's
25:31
limited competition today. Um but there is competition coming quickly for Falcon. I mean even Starship is going to
25:38
be competition but you know Neutron will will uh will be launching soon. Uh New
25:44
Glenn is coming online with its first launch successful and then second launch coming up as well. I think we're going
25:49
to start to see further cost reductions to get to orbit. And so when that kind
25:55
of main input cost drops your cost of accessing the globe just goes down and
26:00
goes down and goes down. It's kind of like, you know, yeah, as semiconductors get cheaper, you can build more
26:06
computers, which means you can network those computers, which means you can have you can build Facebook. Um, and
26:12
that's kind of where we're at today. It's like an emerging thing. Yeah. Yeah. So, for you, is there any like
26:17
non-obvious questions that people like that you wouldn't go into the starting
26:23
the company with? Um, but that have come out from just going after it and boots on the ground sort of thing. I think the
26:29
behavior shift when you have when you're able to rely on this is like an interesting question. Um the question we
26:35
always we I mean we get is like what payloader are you gonna carry right and like
26:40
that's kind of like asking what the main use case of a phone was going to be in
26:47
you know maybe tw you know in early the early 2000s right um well behavior shift
26:54
hasn't happened to the smartphone quite yet right the iPhone let's just say the iPhone has just been introduced what's the main use case for the iPhone well at
27:00
the time it was envisioned as internet, uh, email and and and music and phone.
27:06
Um, I'm would bet a ton of money, and I don't know this for sure, but that most people's screen time is now dominated by
27:13
social media and and content consumption. Connecting with people in a way that just wasn't even possible or even like
27:18
foretold at that point. Yeah. And like not even connecting, it's content consumption, right? Like an
27:24
iPhone is a content consumption device and it just happens to also be able to make phone calls, right? like uh well like I think most
27:31
people browse the internet on their computer more and uh um and spend the
27:39
time they spend on their phone is mainly dominated by content consumption. Um but
27:45
that was not the initial pitch for the iPhone, right? The initial pitch was all about connectivity, right? Phone,
27:51
internet, email. Um, and so when we talk about what the what payloads are we
27:56
going to carry, what missions are we carry, like we know what we're going to go do, you know, for the first couple, right, for the or for the first, you know, dozen, two dozen, three dozen,
28:02
something like that. Um, but how do uh behaviors shift over time is is
28:09
something that we find very exciting. I if you pay and if you think about what
28:16
we're doing in parallel with the uh reduction in cost of drones and other
28:23
autonomous systems um and the increase in uh you know the the intellect of AI
28:31
and and general autonomy you can put on these types of vehicles.
28:36
It's reasonable to extrapolate that uh in in the future
28:43
most of our missions will not involve humans.
28:48
We will not deliver to humans for any need or it might even be like delivering an
28:54
autonomous system sort of thing either that or delivering to support those systems something something in
28:59
that world right if you extrapolate like there is it is and I don't know when that will happen maybe it's 5 years
29:05
maybe it's 10 years maybe it's 30 but uh it is not unforeseeable that we are able
29:13
that most of our demand actually comes from independent of humans being in the
29:18
location we're delivering to. Um I I was talking with our uh kind of our uh GNC
29:25
team and we were just kind of chatting and um it was an interesting point we
29:32
got to which is uh if the first aircraft didn't have to
29:38
have humans, it probably wouldn't have. Like the reason aircraft had like the
29:44
early airplanes, right? The Wright brothers and you know and so forth had humans on board was because well there
29:50
was no other way to control them, right? There there was no such thing as a computer even at the time. And so you needed a human on board to
29:56
control them and and guide them and fly them and steer them. And so you coming out of that you get these these heroic
30:02
feats of you know Amelia Heerheart and and um uh you know crossing the Atlantic. Um and uh you know the uh um
30:12
you know Charles Lindberg right was hailed as a hero as an American hero as a uh and that was kind of like an
30:20
artifact of the fact that there was no autonomous guidance system or or or you know
30:27
autopilot to fly those. Um, and so like I bet the engineers or the
30:33
safety people or or even just the like performance design team would have loved to not have to keep a human alive when
30:40
flying an aircraft, right? It could have made it thinner and smaller and faster style sort of situation or just or even just like put more fuel
30:46
in where the and be able to deliver the same cargo further. Um, and so you know, we've gotten the
30:52
question of like, oh, are you going to deliver people and you know the
30:58
we have the benefit that we don't have to start with humans. Like that's super awesome to be in that position. Um and
31:05
the space shuttle was not in that position as an example, right? They had human pilots flying the shuttle as it
31:11
comes down um down to the ground. But you know the advancements of
31:17
uh you know edge compute and like the uh the the our kind of AI stack that's on
31:24
the vehicle allows us to have the you know close to equivalent of human decision- making faster with better
31:31
sensor data uh in you know near real time and real time anywhere on Earth. Yeah, I
31:38
know on Dragon, Elon was incredibly and that entire team was like incredibly focused on making sure that nothing went
31:44
wrong on those missions. Um because you have a human on board and you can't have someone blow up. Um is there anything
31:50
that you've been able to do because you're just going to have like basically dead cargo on board
31:55
that you wouldn't have been able to do otherwise? Um I think like the the starting place for most like spa uh like
32:04
engineers coming from the space industry is that you don't have to have humans in on your system. So I think like
32:10
our kind of buildout of the business and of our engineering culture and requirements processes and all of that
32:18
were born in an environment that didn't consider humans. So, I think it's hard to hard to answer if we do or don't like
32:26
or maybe rather uh we certainly do probably in every single decision, but I
32:31
could not tell you the the counterfactual because we haven't, you know, we haven't been in that environment to go and actually
32:37
run through those decisions. Yeah, it's not a factor in our it's not a factor in our decision-m. So like for
32:42
example we have one parachute uh one main parachute um that we have and we don't have a backup parachute and and
32:48
that is an intentional decision that the reliability meets our targeted reliability but SpaceX did not have that
32:56
luxury right NASA required redundant parachutes um or sky divers as an example always have their backup
33:02
parachute just in case uh we don't need to have that for and so maybe that's a good that's a good answer to your
33:08
question of like you're able to like keep costs lower and then make it like a simple system a lot simpler.
33:13
Yeah. So, I know you basically said I think it's something like right now even with
33:18
a distributed set of uh bases and all these different things, it's like a 5 to 6 hour lead time before you can actually
33:25
get some piece of cargo to someplace uh without you know from space uh like
33:30
payload delivery. How much infrastructure is this replacing? A lot. I think that there's a world that
33:38
uh overseas bases are purely for political reasons rather than
33:43
operational reasons in probably 30 years from now. And do you know how much like
33:49
infrastructure that is tens to hundreds of billions of dollars a year? Yeah, it's it is uh the vast
33:56
majority of the DoD's, you know, or a a large amount of the DoD's budget is in
34:03
operations and maintenance O andM funding, not necessarily the funding to actually go buy the new system, but
34:09
rather maintain it uh uh keep it operational, distribute around the globe. Um, and uh, yeah, I think I think
34:18
that like more than anybody can conceive right now
34:23
is going to get replaced by this. How many of these do you think you're going to need in orbit? Uh, once you
34:30
know, you aren't constrained by just launch windows and all that stuff and everything is kind of fleshed out. Are
34:36
you going to have like hundreds of these or thousands in orbit? Yeah, I think we'll probably get to the place where we
34:41
have uh singledigit thousands to, you know, low tens of thousands. Um, once you get
34:49
to that level, you actually want to switch to a different like concept of operations. It no longer
34:55
then makes sense to have tons of distributed vehicles, but rather it makes more sense to start to
35:02
centralize cargo in singular locations with multiple vehicles that can deliver
35:07
a selected cargo. Um, but that's still decades away. Um, I think that the uh um
35:16
part of the problem like you can imagine like hundreds of space stations all with like being a warehouse with the delivery
35:22
vehicles that fly off, right? The the problem is you can't start there. Um if
35:28
you start you you don't have enough cargo. Uh you don't have enough um budget. There is not like
35:34
there are constraints. There are constraints that make it more advantageous to start with the delivery
35:39
vehicle being the host vehicle because it allows you to scale uh in less step
35:45
change ways, right? You can kind of continuously launch new vehicles rather than having to put, you know, a whole
35:52
bet on a major a little bit more like the Starlink satellites where you can just do version one, version two, version three, and you
35:58
only start really really scaling up once you have something that's like absolutely fantastic. Yeah. I mean, I think I think SpaceX
36:04
totally would have flown thousands of V1 Star links if they hadn't made V2 better
36:12
already, right? Um, and that's kind of how we will we will work. Um, more so
36:18
like um you don't have a big Amazon distri uh distribution center until
36:24
there's a city's worth of demand for that, you know, those types of cargo uh
36:29
those types of goods. Um, and so rather you start off with like a
36:35
single CVS, right? And it's much easier to scale single CVS's than it is to scale massive distribution centers. Um,
36:42
maybe that analogy is a bit stretched, but uh, we'll probably see thousands to tens of
36:50
thousands of these in orbit. So when you talked about the behavior change, I'd imagine that it's not only how people
36:57
kind of operate in the field, but it's also like getting people to decide that this is a like known quantity and that
37:02
this is even accessible or possible in the first place. Um what was it kind of like trying to like
37:09
educate people on here's what this can do, here's what it can't do, like maybe it doesn't deliver humans, but here's
37:14
what it can do uh in the first place. Yeah. Well, I mean with any new technology, right, you have your adoption curve you have to run through.
37:20
Um, and one of the first first stops on that curve is education, right, before
37:26
you get to full adoption. And so, you know, we had we were fortunate to be able to kind of ground our
37:35
uh vehicles and our operations in that of airdrops, right? People are used to
37:41
calling in cargo uh and having it delivered by aircraft or cargo, you
37:46
know, or whatever whatever system they want to deliver. And so we we're fortunate enough to be able to be like,
37:51
you know, we basically talk about how we're not really a space company, right?
37:56
Like we are a space company in the same way that like Nike is an internet company. Like yes, they use the internet
38:02
to sell their products and market their products, but fundamentally they're an athletics brand or or or a lifestyle
38:07
brand depending on what you think. Um and we just happen to use space, right? Like we the only reason we use space is
38:14
because that is the best way to get access to the globe. If we could do it by tunneling, we probably would do it by
38:19
tunneling. And so when we talk to customers, you know, hey, uh, that requirement you have of being able to
38:26
respond to the conflict when and wherever it breaks out, you know, right now you're fulfilling that, you know, with aircraft and and etc, etc. What if
38:33
you added this to it, right? What if you added the ability to uh come from space and and you know, from your perspective
38:39
or from the operator's perspective, they're calling in an airdrop or they're calling in um, you know, whatever.
38:45
uh but it's just going to come from space instead of the airplane and but there's no difference in how that works
38:51
to start right and so to start we try to see how we can be you know better faster
38:57
cheaper in today in current operations um and then as people start to
39:04
understand that we can then start to talk about now that you have that as a reliable
39:10
function here are the other things you don't need to do that you're currently doing or here are the new things you could do
39:16
that you're not able to do today. Um, and I think that's really where people's eyes start to light up and they start to
39:22
see like, oh, this is not just an increment. This will rewrite fundamentally how we think about
39:29
accessing the globe and transportation around the globe um in the same way a
39:34
century ago the aircraft did. Yeah. And has there been any missions over the past like 20ish years where if
39:42
there had been like rapid access to supplies in under an hour, things would have turned out differently in a way
39:48
that they they didn't. I think that uh there there are countless examples of
39:54
this in uh especially across like the war on terror where
40:00
people were not able to be supported when they needed that support and that led to poor out unnecessary deaths or things like that.
40:07
It could be that. It could be, you know, there's examples of that. There are examples of the mission failing. There
40:12
are examples of uh it being more expensive than it needed to, right? having to send in extra um resources and
40:20
support. Um a a a way to think about it is um what
40:26
would the last 20 years have looked like if we didn't have aircraft? And like the answer is kind of like it
40:32
would be fundamentally different. It would be totally different. Like uh
40:37
it would we would we would be it's hard it would be back as if it were
40:43
World War I or earlier, right? And so, um, what does a,
40:50
you know, what does a, uh, Civil War battle look like that an aircraft is plopped into?
40:57
Just changes everything completely different, right? It it is a fundamental uh, mismatch in in forces
41:05
uh, and technology. Um, there's kind of the I don't know, there's a bunch of YouTube videos that are like fun of
41:10
like, what if an F-22 went up against Napoleon's army or something like that, right? And like, you know, they're a
41:16
little absurd, but it's the it's asking the question of what if uh what if you
41:21
had such great technical overmatch? How would that change? And and what usually the conclusion is is like the technical
41:29
overmatch is so great it doesn't even make sense to fight like a landslide victory. It doesn't even make sense to even try
41:35
to engage it, right? Cuz like what are you going to do? Throw a spear at an F22 or or you know, shoot it with a cannon?
41:40
Like you're not, right? Um and so uh it's hard to
41:47
do the counterfactual of what would it look like if you know you can do specifics of oh here is where we could
41:54
have delivered life-saving supplies or missionritical supplies that would have
41:59
changed the outcome but fundamentally the entire any conflict would be completely different um with that
42:05
is China trying to build some sort of similar system or are we kind of the only country that's doing it.
42:12
Um, China has active space planes. Um, it's not a far stretch to make a bunch
42:17
of them and put them in orbit. Do you think in like a hypothetical future conflict, this would give us like a significant advantage on that front?
42:24
100%. Um, it gives an advantage to every single
42:29
branch of the military, right? in every single domain of operation being able to be supported by the space domain is uh
42:38
is a force multiplier, right? Um it's hard to conceive of a world where
42:48
deliveries to the battlefield aren't happening from space or or to remote teams or, you know, to the middle of the
42:55
ocean, right? um it's too fast and too good of a
43:02
capability for that to not exist. The only reasonable argument against that
43:09
existing is cost. And right now the cost makes sense for a
43:18
vast vast array of uh of of missions and cargo and effects.
43:25
But like we talked about earlier, costs are coming down substantially in the launch industry and costs come down with
43:32
any technology curve. And so to bet against the like imperious nature of
43:40
cost reduction of technology is like a fool's errand. And so
43:47
you can have you can like it is reasonable to debate if between 2022 and
43:52
2026 if or maybe 2025 if the costs bore the
44:00
uh the value that uh you know that delivery would have. And from from everything
44:06
we've looked at the answer was always yes. But you can ask the question once you get towards the end of this decade
44:12
in the ear, you know, the early 2030s, which you know is we're closer. Yeah, we're getting closer and closer.
44:18
We're four years away. Uh it's impossible to argue that it's not.
44:23
Some companies decide to vertically integrate a lot more than others. Um how have you kind of thought about that and
44:29
like what has been the process for deciding which which parts to vertically integrate and not?
44:35
Yeah, so we try to vert vertically integrate everything. So, our race spacecraft, we built practically everything in house. Um, uh, everything
44:42
from the tanks for the propellant to the separation system that connected us to Falcon 9 to the parachute system to the
44:49
engine to the software, the avionics, the solar panels, you know, list goes on.
44:54
What's the like logic behind doing that? Yeah. So, there's a couple reasons we do that. Um
45:00
uh the first was you know the the the first reason we do
45:07
vertical integration is because it results in a better product. Um the supply base is not robust enough such
45:14
that you have infinitely granular options that to of subcomponents right
45:20
like there are discrete components you can go and buy right there's a discrete number of valves that exist.
45:25
Some things literally just don't exist. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Some things don't exist but or some things you could make work, right? But when you have to make a
45:33
could work decision across thousands of components, you end up with a flawed or
45:38
or or less uh not as good for the customer product.
45:44
Less optimized. Yeah, it's less it's it's it's a less optimized product. It has more
45:49
compromises baked into every subcomponent because ah maybe this one's slightly bigger than we want, but that's
45:55
fine. we'll deal with it. Well, now we have to deal with it with this and with that and with that. Um, that's like one
46:01
thing, but the other is really around supply chain and time and cost, which is
46:07
if you want like a valve, a certain valve today, it's 18 months, right? Like like there are uh we when we went out to
46:14
get parachutes for our vehicle, uh it was going to be three years and millions of dollars. And so we said, well, we can
46:21
build those. let's go hire the team and buy the sewing machines and now we make our own parachutes. Um, and it it allows
46:28
for this iteration cycle at the core the the the deepest level of the product
46:33
that influences the rest of the product. And so, um, I think it's smart to not
46:39
vertically integrate in industries where your supply base is also moving as fast or faster than you are, right? Uh, the
46:47
electronics and consumer electronics industry is a great place to show this, right? Like no startup is going to build
46:54
batteries faster and iterate on like you know you know 18650 sells faster than the general supply chain is going to
47:01
BYD or Tesla or or yeah or Panasonic or or you know Samsung but when there is a singular
47:08
parachute supplier in the United States that doesn't care about the uh that
47:14
doesn't care about new companies that doesn't frankly care about innovating because why the hell should
47:20
they have all the contracts, right? There's no incentive for them to move quickly and there's no incentive for
47:27
them to meet, you know, a startup's demands and needs, timelines or cost. Exactly. So that's the early that's the
47:34
early reasons, right? Which is we we do it because it makes a better first product and it lets us control our
47:39
timelines, our costs and our iteration in the development cycle for us faster.
47:44
Um, as we get into production though, that's where it really shines, which is you can
47:52
switch from, okay, now I have a really great product that's been optimized around the customer needs to now I can
48:00
optimize every single component within that to be as cheap and as easy to manufacture as possible. And I can
48:05
eliminate components and I can combine components. Like as an example um in like automotive uh in traditional
48:13
automotive a lot of car companies are not car manufacturers but our car assemblers right they get the center
48:20
console from one company and they get the door switch you know the I think that Boeing has uh like 747 has
48:28
something like or Boeing has like 120,000 suppliers or some crazy number like that. Something like that.
48:33
Yeah. And like stay staying in the automotive world, you have computer you
48:38
have you have a computer that controls the center screen and you have a computer that controls the light switches and so they can't talk to each
48:44
other and so you have redundancy that you can't eliminate, right? But when you have a full understanding of your whole
48:50
product and full control over all of them, you can start to do things like,
48:56
well, what if I didn't need a uh a controller on my motor, but I could
49:01
build that into my avionic system. And like that's probably not the right decision to start. And you know, for example, a lot of our motors have the
49:08
you know, built a built-in controller, but eventually you can move towards that. And so then now you can use a cheaper think through and say like a few
49:14
iterations in the future how much cost can we get down? Yeah. And yeah and then the final reason we do that is
49:20
around um reliability of supply chain. So we are
49:30
um our missions are highly binary in the fact that they launch at a launch date.
49:36
every single system has to be ready to go and has to be integrating the vehicle at, you know, you know, the the date we
49:42
need to integrate onto the rocket. And so you can't really have one system that lags behind. If one system lags behind,
49:48
the whole vehicle lags behind. And so we've run into this countless times where like a supplier is delayed and now
49:55
it's like that's delayed by 6 months. They're the only supplier.
50:01
Yeah. Is our whole company delayed by 6 months? And like we don't want to have to have that as a risk item in the
50:07
business. And so you know where there are robust supply chains with multiple
50:13
vendors that are moving quickly that are supported by other industries such as batteries as a great example. We're not
50:19
going to touch those, right? You know maybe we'll assemble our own battery package. We need the form and function of a certain thing but we're not going
50:24
to do our own our own cell level. Um, but when you start to get into these
50:30
highly you you are now a derivative of your supplier, right? If your supplier
50:36
is slow, you're slow. If if the parachute manufacturer decides that they
50:41
their army contract is more important, then you're fine. Woke up on the wrong side of the bed and
50:47
you're going to be delayed by six months. Who care? You know, what do they care, right? You're a small fish. And so the
50:52
best way to avoid that is to build your own. What uh so going back to like the super early days, you know, you you
50:58
talked about basically trying trying to go out find vendors to fill all these needs and then you know three three
51:05
years or 18 months uh for some of the parts. Um what was it like at the beginning cuz I imagine you're trying to
51:11
do as little as you can to actually make something work or just to start. Um how
51:17
did you kind of change philosophy over time? Yeah. Well, I think there's like, you know, there are examples where you can
51:23
solve that problem with money. Um, and that can work quite well, right? Going out and saying, you know, I'm I don't
51:29
want to build anything. I'm just going to buy it from a supplier or from like a, you know, a satellite bus provider or
51:34
something like that can work quite well and and and it does to a lot of degree.
51:40
Um but now you are uh now you don't have that experience of
51:46
building. Your company's not built around building. Your company's built around assembling. And so you aren't
51:53
building those muscles. You aren't building the processes. You aren't building the culture. You aren't hiring the people focused on deep level high
52:01
quality iteration and design. And so early on we knew that ARC was the place
52:07
we needed to get to. and Ray was the way to get there. And so the purpose of Ray,
52:13
like if we just bought Ray, it wouldn't have served the function, right? If we literally purchased the vehicle and flew
52:18
it, it's it didn't it wouldn't have done anything for the not building any muscle memory. Yeah. Or or processes or testing or anything
52:25
like that, right? And so the decision to bring in house versus go out of house,
52:30
you know, part of it is, you know, we check, hey, could we get this right? Because if like some things we don't need to have a core
52:37
competency in, right? Like we don't need a core competency to start in solenoid
52:43
valves. A solenoid valve is going to work as a solenoid valve is going to work. And like your main optimization
52:49
for that is cost, which we don't super care about early on because you know it's 100. It's you know uh 800 bucks
52:55
instead of $100. And like you can stomach that early on for a one-off vehicle and you'll bring those in house later. But where we know we need a core
53:02
competency, it it's inconceivable to me to bring to hand that off to another company, right?
53:09
Where your core business doesn't function if you don't have that other component or or that other supplier or
53:16
other vendor. Um that's a weird place to be for me. Uh
53:21
and I think it makes a lot of sense to build that inhouse. Yeah. where especially with this sort of thing where the the launch windows are
53:27
incredibly important and having things ready in case you can ship just a little bit faster is super important. Um how
53:34
are you thinking about like planning a few months years into the future and figuring out which things do you need
53:40
you know in this warehouse whereas maybe you can just get it moment of Yeah. Um well the the the great thing
53:46
about the team we've hired is uh it's a very decentralized decision-m process on
53:53
that and we we specifically hire a team that understands those problems has
53:59
experience in those problems um and has full ownership of their systems. So when
54:05
our you know the responsible engineer for the flaps on the back of the vehicle
54:10
uh is designing the system and is looking at that he's looking at well what is the uh lead time for the
54:18
actuators what is the lead time for the materials all of that um and that's happening early in the conceptual design
54:24
of the vehicle and that is rolling up then to the like overarching you know vehicle level timeline that's
54:31
understanding okay uh these these actuators are going to be a three-month
54:37
lead time, but then they need six months of testing or whatever. And you kind of you're able to back it out from there
54:42
versus like, okay, we know we can buy, you know, standard screws or lock wire we can buy
54:50
whenever. Um and so we try to identify what are the uh long lead items that are
54:58
high risk that we need to make sure we either are manufacturing fully inhouse or we have uh multiple vendors for or we
55:06
have like you know ordered it early enough that we can pivot if we need to. Right? So um we try to make sure that
55:14
the team and the individual engineers on the team have that full scope of
55:20
ownership and can hold the full the their full system and all the design
55:26
build and test that goes into it in context at all times. Right? So we're we try to keep a very lean and talent dense
55:32
team because the goal is that like the whole team should be able to hold the whole context of the vehicle in their
55:39
head at any given time. So that if you ask a avionics engineer why they've made
55:44
the decision to go with this sensor, they can say something like well uh the
55:51
parachute needs to have this amount of accuracy and as such this has driven it
55:57
uh has driven my decision-m. If you look at big defense primes and
56:03
how they design their systems traditionally, that context holding is replaced by
56:11
detailed requirements. Not like make sure you have everything organized, but like you are going to have this very
56:19
specific load requirement on your structural beam and it's going to go in this force direction and you're going to
56:25
design and you have a mass budget and a material allocation and like this is how you're going to design this bracket. Um
56:32
the problem is that takes like a decade to develop just the requirements, let alone the actual design. And so when
56:38
we're trying to ride the bike as we're building it, it's important that everybody on the team is constantly
56:45
making decisions with context from other systems and are communicating across systems and are um
56:53
um empowered to have those like have the right to make a decision as needed.
56:59
So did you try to keep the team kind of like artificially small for the first you know fourish years before you had
57:05
something where you were sending it to orbit? Um, I think we kept the team at the level that it needed to be. I don't
57:11
know if it's artificially small or not. I mean, it's way smaller than any other team I've I've heard of. You
57:17
know, we were 25 people building the entire vehicle in house. You know, we I think we had besid we had like a couple
57:24
software engineers, but every single subsystem was single threaded, right? Like uh but that's all that was needed.
57:32
Um, so I I don't know why a bigger team it wouldn't have necessarily helped you
57:38
move faster or I think there there would have been some benefits if we had a few extra people. Um,
57:44
but I like it's this weird thing where like I don't know why everybody else needs such a big team. Like
57:52
yeah, I don't I don't understand that. Um, and and I think that kind of goes to like the folks we've hired here are
58:00
incredibly dedicated, incredibly excited. We we try to screen for people who we could see as future founders,
58:06
right? That that are driven for a by a purpose bigger than themselves with a
58:12
creativity and a a decision-m capability that um can be independent of any sort
58:20
of you don't have to be told what to do. You're kind of like intuitively just trying to figure Yeah, exactly. You're expected to not be
58:26
told what you're what to do. If if if you are being told what to do, that's a huge problem within a company.
58:31
So, how how have you been like screening for that? What are you what traits are you looking for? Well, you want to you want to try an
58:37
interview question? Sure. Go for it. Uh okay. So, uh I'll give there's a
58:42
two-part question. Um the first part, uh I'll tell you the second part after the first part. Um, I
58:50
want you to just choose two random things in the office like, you know, choose them. Tell me what they are.
58:55
Sure. Uh, forklift thing and then I don't know
59:01
that table. Okay. So, we have a a forklift and a table. Um, so what I want you to do is
59:06
come up with three products, ideas, companies, whatever inspired by, based
59:11
on, or or you know, thought of from those two items. So it could be for an
59:17
exit for example uh a a a ta a standing desk that can also be used to uh raise
59:25
up as a podium that you could stand on for giving a talk to the team, you know, so something like that.
59:31
An IKEA warehouse. Yeah. Yeah. Um okay. What what's been
59:36
the most uh interesting responses that you've gotten with that question? So the fun part about it is it is totally
59:41
different depending on what people choose. And so like there's no there's no like actual like right answer to
59:46
those questions. And frankly like it's kind of a silly question and the ideas are not meant to be serious in any way.
59:53
Uh this is one of those questions that's like hey tell me how you think. Right? And I'm not screening and it's it's
1:00:00
fundamentally independent of uh anybody's role or background or uh um
1:00:08
skill set right or technical skill set. It's purely a question of like can you think of random things at uh in a
1:00:15
relatively high pressure setting being a being an interview um and you know where
1:00:22
does your mind go and what connections do you make cuz like decision-m and problem solving is just about like
1:00:28
random context and being able to use that random context to uh find a way through the problem. Um, and this is a
1:00:35
similar thing which is like I don't know what like what am I going to make between a table and a forklift or a scissor lift. Like uh I guess I
1:00:42
could use the material and make a you know a wooden forklift that comes in an IKEA box to lift a you know cuckoo clock
1:00:49
onto the wall or something. Um uh but like consistently the folks that
1:00:58
are like are like I am completely blown away by their performance here. crush
1:01:03
that question. It's it's the cra like it's it's a uh uh and maybe it's anecdotal and maybe
1:01:09
I'm just remembering those specifically, but um yeah, I like that and it's fun to just
1:01:15
kind of chat about and iterate on it. You know, when when you do find those people that are incredibly creative, think on their
1:01:21
feet, they can be future founder types. Uh what kind of control are you or you know latitude are you trying to give
1:01:27
them so that they can kind of do their best work while here? Well, the thing I say, so whenever I do whenever someone
1:01:33
starts, we do, uh, you know, onboarding and I'll talk to them and kind of go through and tell them about the culture
1:01:39
and the company. Um, and I I always say like my job as the CEO is to give you
1:01:46
the direction you need to run in and then unblock you so you can run as fast as you possibly want to,
1:01:51
systematically unfuck people. Yeah. Like basically like like what's your problem that is blocking you from
1:01:57
being as great as you could be? Um, and we've found that, you know, it's
1:02:02
important to have a make sure people know what direction they're running because when you have creative, ambitious people, they they they will
1:02:08
run and you got to like and it and in the system of a company, it needs to be aligned with where everybody else is.
1:02:14
You need to make sure that everyone has the why in the back of their minds while they're just running at full speed. Exactly. And then remove the roadblocks
1:02:21
and like a lot of that is like administrative and bure like bureaucracy based, right? making sure to eliminate
1:02:27
unnecessary uh red tape, if you will. Um, but some of it could be as simple as like making
1:02:34
sure we have enough machines to manufacture prototypes of their hardware so they can test it quickly. Um, yeah,
1:02:41
and and and I I always try to tell people like I want you to run as fast as you possibly can, right? And if you're
1:02:48
ever blocked or slowed down, like let me know and we'll figure out whatever that might be. Um, yeah. and and consistently
1:02:56
uh the team has just been crushing it. You know, if you fast forward a few years and you've put a bunch of these things in
1:03:01
orbit, um what are you going to be basically focused on at that point? You know, once we have kind of our first
1:03:08
fleet of vehicles on orbit, um I I think the big thing we're going to be focused
1:03:14
on is scale, right? Is how do you scale up production and how do you get to the scale that you
1:03:20
need to Are you going to try to do that in the US here? Oh, yeah. Well, I don't know if it'll be in LA, but it will definitely
1:03:26
be domestic. Like, it not only do I want it to be, but it has to be. Um, uh,
1:03:32
and so that will be a big deal is how fast can we scale and how
1:03:38
much can we drop the costs of these vehicles. Um, the the market for this is infinitely elastic is my point of view.
1:03:46
And so any cost reduction results in a greater than that increase in the market
1:03:52
by a ton. Um and so it will be about like scaling production and getting
1:03:58
those that production to be as as efficient as possible. Um I think that's going to be the number one thing for us.
1:04:05
Yeah. I remember uh hearing I was reading like Elon's biography that Walter Isacson did and I think Elon had
1:04:14
this before the first few like the first actual orbital launch. He was talking
1:04:20
with his team and he was basically saying every day that we delay is like $10 million in future revenue that
1:04:25
doesn't get unlocked because we delayed by one day and so we should be constantly like running this you know made if we can mess uh undo some issue
1:04:32
today and it cost $100,000 it may make sense to do that and you know pay for it uh just to make the 10 million happen a
1:04:39
little sooner. um for you on like speeding things up, what is what is your
1:04:45
process for basically making things happen faster that shouldn't be possible? Yeah. Well, I think that like the easy
1:04:51
answer is you like and kind of most obvious answer is usually like spend money. Um like the Elon quotes a a reasonable
1:04:59
first pass at like looking at that. Um most of the time though that uh spending
1:05:07
money uh or maybe necessarily spending money indicates that you are doing a
1:05:14
thing. Mhm. Which might be wrong like it might be faster to eliminate the process that you
1:05:21
were going to go and do or question requirement thing. Exactly. Like um you can you know speed up parts. you
1:05:28
can, you know, have a courier deliver your part in 8 hours from Florida to
1:05:33
California if you need to. Um, I think our biggest the biggest place we've seen
1:05:39
speed improvements is when you you you ask the question of like why are you doing that? And like it's not a super
1:05:46
novel approach, I don't think. And like maybe there's unique things we do that others don't that I don't know about,
1:05:52
but I think it's just the basic of like do we actually have to be doing this thing right now? And like what is the
1:05:58
core reason we're doing it? And like most of the time we find out that the core reason is uh based on an assumption
1:06:06
or a requirement that was uh determined or or or set early enough that it was
1:06:13
the best one that could have been set and it was it was right for the time but no longer right for today. And so the
1:06:18
fastest way you can speed stuff up is just like remove that as a constraint. Do you have a like process for
1:06:24
systematically eliminating things that still like may have made sense you know at the very beginning but don't make sense today like is that actual
1:06:30
um process so we try to not do that in a process but rather in culture. um if
1:06:35
it's in a process then people have to remember the process and they have to follow the process and they have to like
1:06:41
um that that's a whole that's another thing they have to do but rather we try to
1:06:46
instill that in the culture of the team and how we work which is like um uh you
1:06:52
know that is a thing that Austin and I try to model within the company but also
1:06:57
you know we hire people that do that inherently um and kind of think that way inherently and so that helps with a
1:07:04
flywheel when we're sitting in a design review or when we're doing a CAD spin at someone's desk and it's like, you know,
1:07:10
why does this exist? Right? And like part of the reason you're asking that is like cuz you're curious and part of it's
1:07:16
cuz you're like there's something in the back of your head telling you like that doesn't make sense to exist like that I I don't know the reason so why the hell
1:07:22
is that there? Um uh so so we we try to do focus a lot on
1:07:28
like the culture of the company and not just like do you have a positive culture or a negative culture like that kind of
1:07:34
like high like you know a higher level you know call it like a glass door
1:07:40
culture uh uh write up but rather like how does culture permeate into like how
1:07:45
we make decisions, how we design parts, how we um how we hire, how we show up to
1:07:51
meetings. All of that is like a part of the culture here at Inversion. What do you think uh like leadership
1:07:58
stylewise? What what leadership style have you tried to emulate? Um I I don't think I've I I think I
1:08:06
tried to take bits and pieces that I like from play various different locations. Um
1:08:14
I think uh there's no one particular person that I think has a leadership
1:08:21
style that would work for me. Um and I think that's like maybe a key thing for
1:08:26
me which is the the concept that um the leadership style or the management style
1:08:32
or what have you is only as right as it is right for the person. in a similar
1:08:39
way that like athletes don't all train the same because some like high volume, some like low volume, high intensity,
1:08:46
um, and different things work for different people. I think that's probably the same uh the same approach
1:08:52
that like myself and Austin take. Like our leadership styles are completely different um uh like the actual like
1:09:00
stylistic point, right? Um I don't find that my style is or I am the most
1:09:07
effective for example when there is like a lot of like
1:09:13
um structure like I much prefer a unstructured
1:09:18
kind of leadership and management style for myself and that works for me and for my my direct reports as I guess as well
1:09:25
as there's like a little bit more serendipity day dayto day figuring out what to do serendipity or like
1:09:32
intentional wandering, right? Like maybe that's a an example where Jeff Bezos talks about uh
1:09:39
how uh what is it called? Uh it's like pondering or something in the morning.
1:09:44
Yeah. Like he talks about how for meetings he likes to have a like very crisp document they can read and then
1:09:50
lots of time to wander, right? and like the crisp document like he likes it in a written format or whatever but like the
1:09:57
purpose of that is to make sure everyone's on the same page in the meeting right so that there is enough context set that the really smart and
1:10:04
creative people in the meeting can then just kind of think and wander and talk and stuff like that and so um I think
1:10:10
the the main goal I have is to make sure the team is unblocked and trusted right
1:10:19
like like if there's one thing it's like trust that the team is able to do it
1:10:27
right because like 99.9% of the time that's true and if you
1:10:36
you know hire great people like we try to do they flourish more in the case where
1:10:43
they can use their freedom and creativity rather than if they're you're they're like told what to do. So, I
1:10:50
guess like let the team run as long as they're running in the right direction.
1:10:56
Yeah. Set the why and then let them go. Yep. Exactly. Interesting. For me on interviews, I
1:11:01
love doing interviews, but I hate editing and I don't love trying to figure out all the logistics around getting to a shoot and making the shoot
1:11:07
happen. So, I want to hire away those kinds of parts of the job. Uh, for you, what's the most fun part about being a
1:11:15
CEO? And like what are the things that you kind of just offloaded?
1:11:20
It's an interesting question. Um, I love the cycle of talking with customers, getting
1:11:28
their feedback, iterating on the product, and having that insight and that like moment of of kind of like uh
1:11:39
there's like a feeling when you get when you're like, "Oh, I know how to solve that problem for the customer."
1:11:45
A little bit of an aha. Yeah. A bit of an aha moment. this kind of like excitement builds and then you
1:11:51
kind of like go down the path of iterating on it. Like I I for at least from an enjoyment perspective, that is
1:11:57
the part that I absolutely love is, you know, thinking about an a problem from
1:12:05
first principles, talking with the customer about it, understanding what they need, understanding what they
1:12:11
actually need, and then figuring out a how the product can adapt or change or
1:12:16
or stay the same and meet that. To me, that's like that is my absolute by far
1:12:22
favorite part of inversion is is getting to do that. What was the biggest uh moment were you
1:12:27
talking with a customer and you did experience that aha? Um we were uh we were talking to a bunch
1:12:33
of customers about delivery missions and telling them about how you know ARC is designed to glide such that it can
1:12:40
access the globe. And they were like oh you should go talk to the hypersonics folks like you should go talk to the
1:12:46
folks down the hall. And we went and talked to them and they were like, you
1:12:52
know, first we try to understand what their mission is and you know, oh it's hypersonic testing. Well, what do you test it? Because in my mind, hypersonic
1:12:58
testing was always like throw some materials on the outside and see if the materials survive. And I was like, that
1:13:03
can't be that big of a market. And like it actually isn't. It's not that big of a market. But what they what they really
1:13:11
wanted ARC for was the ability to maneuver during hypersonics lets them do
1:13:18
lets them test more than just materials. It lets them test sensors on the ground to track the vehicle. It lets them test,
1:13:26
you know, uh uh components inside. And that was a very much like, oh, like this
1:13:33
is not a onetrick pony vehicle. It's even more than we thought, right? The the core of a lowcost platform that is
1:13:41
able to integrate payloads and is able to maneuver in the hypersonic and supersonic regimes of re-entry is
1:13:49
far more useful than we initially even thought. Um, that was that was I think one that was super cool.
1:13:55
Okay. Uh, final question. What's the hardest thing you've overcome? I think the
1:14:02
this is going to be like maybe a bit of a unsatisfying answer.
1:14:07
I think the hardest thing was the first decision of of jumping in
1:14:13
cuz once once you make the decision you're going to do it, then everything else is like
1:14:20
like everything else is like, well, I got to go solve that problem cuz I'm doing the thing, right? The decision has been made. It was one decision. It was,
1:14:27
am I going to like are we going to go for it? Do we think that we can have as big of an impact on the world as as
1:14:33
we've always thought we could? Once you make that decision that the answer is yes, everything else fits in a framework
1:14:41
of like well I am doing this hard thing because you know I want to have this impact on the world or you know I want
1:14:46
to serve these customers or like you're doing it right. Um, it's very easy to not do it, right? Like everybody has
1:14:53
ideas every day and like I, you know, kept a journal of cool ideas for my whole life and the like first decision
1:15:01
of like are we sending it until we're living on the streets? Yes. All right, cool. Like the decisions made. Um,
1:15:10
everything else kind of comes a bit easier after that. And on on the, you know, notebook of all the different
1:15:16
ideas that you had, why was this one in particular something that got you over
1:15:21
the edge into deciding, yes, I'm going to go for it? What was the catalyst? Um,
1:15:28
it was a feeling of inevitability that the world would look different,
1:15:34
right? That um that this was such a
1:15:39
obvious no-brainer once we thought of it. frankly that so the first month we spent looking to see who else was doing
1:15:46
it because we we couldn't conceive that this wasn't a thing. We're like we just probably haven't found the You did the whole Elon thing where you
1:15:52
like go on the NASA website and you're like when's the first Mars mission and then you realize oh it's not there. There's no Mars mission.
1:15:58
Like like we literally were like we must be missing something like what is wrong
1:16:03
with this right? Um turns out the why now of inversion is launch costs have
1:16:09
come down. uh uh costs of components have come down, there's capital
1:16:15
availability and there's a market demand because now more than ever global access is
1:16:21
important. Um but yeah, I think it was a an obvious nature of yeah like like we
1:16:29
talked about those structural truths, right? What are what are those undeniable
1:16:34
um things that will be were true a thousand years ago and will be true a thousand years from now? And like AI
1:16:41
LinkedIn is like an ethereal concept that is
1:16:48
probably useful right now, but like you know was it useful 10 years ago? Was it
1:16:53
use will it be useful in a 100 years? Like I don't I don't know. Um, and like that might be an awesome business or
1:16:59
awesome company to build, but like to me if if uh like to me in Austin, if we're
1:17:05
going to dedicate our lives to go and do something, we want it to be something
1:17:10
that we can always say this will be real in 80 years, when we're, you know, when
1:17:16
we're when we're old and dying, it was worth spending our time building
1:17:21
this business to change the world, right? And like the the kind of vision I hang on to is,
1:17:30
you know, sitting uh you know, on the porch with like grandchildren playing in the yard and there's a re-entry vehicle
1:17:37
streaking across the sky and I can look up and say, you know, the team we built
1:17:43
was able to do that and make that a commonality that the grandchildren playing in the yard don't even notice it
1:17:49
because it's so common. And that's an awesome to live in. Yeah.
