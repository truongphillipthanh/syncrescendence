# Why 2025 Is the Single Most Pivotal Year in Our Lifetime

We are at a moment in 2025 where world-historic, game-changing technologies are starting to scale. But America and the world itself are going through huge contortions. The key piece of understanding this moment is tipping points. When do you go from the slow build of a thing that's clunky and not really working to suddenly getting an iPhone that makes you think, "This is the most amazing thing in the world," and then everybody needs one? What I'm arguing now is that we are in the middle of three tipping points—world-historic changes happening around us simultaneously.

I'm Peter Leyden. I've been following the story of technology and its evolution, looking ahead into how it's going to change the world, for the past 25 years.

## The Origins: Wired Magazine and the Digital Revolution

Way back in the 1990s, in the earliest days of the internet, there was really only one place in the world that was all over that story, and that was Wired magazine. In those early days, the founders of Wired picked up on me as someone who had the same sensibility about the transformative nature of these technologies, and they brought me in to work with them.

People had no idea what was going on with the internet. They didn't understand email or the web. They had no idea how these startups with names like Amazon were ever going to amount to anything. Beyond this digital revolution, we were also witnessing the beginning of globalization. My co-author Peter Schwartz and I wrote a famous, iconic cover story at Wired called "The Long Boom." It was a history of the future—the story from 1980, which was in our past, to 2020, which was in our future, trying to explain what was really coming.

## Understanding Technology Adoption Curves

Those of us who are in technology and have been immersed in it for most of our careers can see clearly these incremental stages that all successful new technologies go through: the technology adoption curve. Take Uber, for example. The idea emerged: instead of a taxi, it's all on your phone. When enough people discovered how amazing it was, the entire population moved over and the old taxi system was gone.

You're watching an old system being dismantled or having to come down at the same time as we're taking off on these new technologies to build the next systems. We're smack in the middle of that right now.

## The Pattern: 80-Year Cycles in American History

We've seen this in American history before. There have been three previous junctures where Americans have found themselves in this exact place. This isn't common—the last time we saw this was 80 years ago, and they tend to come in these 80-year cycles. What's remarkable about these periods is that they have bursts of unbelievably widespread innovation that last for 25 years.

### The Post-War Era: 1945–1970

The last big one came off World War II in 1945. Eighty years ago, America was on a very similar parallel. We were watching the dismantling of the old world that had been working reasonably well—the economy and societies of the West—and then there had been a crash: the Great Depression of the 1930s. The old system of running the economy just wasn't working.

At these junctures in American society, we get extremely polarized. For example, there was an America First movement in the 1930s. We were on the verge of violent conflict. Then FDR and the New Deal coalition came out of the Depression and started to get traction. We had to resolve this political tension in America, and frankly, the world had to do it too, because the world was also going through this juncture.

From 1945 to 1970, we witnessed the great post-war boom. Many people call it the high point of global capitalism. We built an economy that did many things completely different from the previous era: taxing the rich at 90%, incredible investment in public infrastructure like the interstate highway system and building suburbs, the GI Bill expanding education and building institutions for higher education for the boomers. That all happened in 25 years—the Great Society, the whole thing—and then in the 1970s it started getting long in the tooth. Stagflation, oil shocks.

But here's the point: the old system had to come down. There was tremendous conflict around it. And ultimately, the building of something that was absolutely unprecedented happened very fast.

### The Gilded Age: 1865–1890

If you go back another 80 years from the 1940s, you're in the Civil War. You're watching essentially the complete dismantling of the old world, the Southern slave economy crashing down, and the rise of the North and industrial capitalism. Coming off the Civil War in 1865, America was on a very similar trajectory.

From 1865 to 1890, we witnessed what historians call the Gilded Age—essentially when industrial capitalism in America really took off. Railroads got built across the continent. Telegraph wires followed those railroads, and communications networks spread. Steel mills appeared. Cities got built. Immigrants poured in from Europe because America was taking off in ways that Europe wasn't. In 25 years, we built an industrial powerhouse. Was it all great? No. Was it all wonderful? No. There were robber barons and inequalities. But the point is, it was this world-historic burst of innovation and essentially building a new basis for our society and economy that then flourished for another 50 years.

### The Founding Era: 1785–1810

If you go back another 80 years from the Civil War, you're at the American Revolution. You're watching the complete crash of the old world and the birth of the new. The American Revolution wasn't just a blip—it was part of a cascade of revolutions that happened over 50 years, starting with the American Revolution and then moving through the French Revolution into South America and ultimately liberating all of the colonies of Spain and Portugal in Central and South America. It was this extraordinary period of reinvention.

Coming off the Revolution in 1785, America embarked on a very similar path. From 1785 to 1810, we witnessed essentially the birth of a modern nation-state out of the Enlightenment ideas about democracy and constitutional government. We established a radically new form of government. We figured out how to take wilderness and build cities almost from scratch. We attracted talent from Europe—the best and brightest who wanted to build something new.

The level of invention was extraordinary. The optimism, the idealism, the naivety—all of it was there. But the point is, in that 25-year burst, we laid the foundations for what became the American experiment. It created a space for essentially the entire wave of innovation that came from Western civilization. Western Europe pioneered many of these ideas and technologies over 120 years, but the forward motion of innovation from the West was sustained by those Americans who had this wide-open continent to spread it to. That has been America's role vis-à-vis the West in every one of those epochs.

## The Three World-Historic Changes of Today

I'm arguing we have one more turn of that wheel with the arrival of three world-historic changes happening around us today.

### The Arrival of Artificial Intelligence

The most obvious one is the arrival of artificial intelligence. With the release of ChatGPT 3.5 in November 2022, I think we're going to see that as a world-historic moment. People will look back on that as the starting gun of what will be understood as the Age of AI.

I use "age" in a very explicit way. When you talk about a different age that humans enter—the Bronze Age or the Iron Age—you're talking about a fundamental game-changing technology, a breakthrough, a step change in our abilities. Once you cross that threshold, you don't go back.

We're going to watch an explosion of amplification. The amplification of our mental powers with digital computers and now AI is going to be very similar to the amplification of our physical powers that mechanical engines—initially steam—created. That amplification created the prosperity and wealth of the world we know now. We're going to reach a point where we say, "We had no idea this was the world we were entering."

### The Rise of Clean Energy

This is the first time we have an energy source that is 100% a technology, not a commodity. We don't have to dig it up like coal. We don't have to tap into it like oil. Why is that important? Because once it's a technology, you can consistently drive down the cost.

There's a rule of thumb in manufacturing: if you double the number of solar panels you're producing, you get about a 20% drop in cost. And this is the point—it's going to keep getting cheaper.

The same thing applies to electric cars. People think electric cars are still expensive, but they're not thinking this through because battery technology follows the same pattern. Lithium batteries are getting cheaper, and we're now getting whole new generations of batteries, like solid-state batteries, that will represent the next leap forward. The forward motion of costs coming down on clean energies is just beginning. When that happens, you're going to have abundant clean energy.

### The Rise of Bioengineering

Right around the time we had our earliest breakthroughs on generative AI—about 15 years ago—we also had the big breakthrough in what's called CRISPR.[^1] We figured out a way to cheaply and easily edit the genome of any living thing.

Take one example. We now know how to take a cell, put it in a vat, and give it the same amino acids and nutrients that a cow roaming around a field for years chewing on grass would get. That cow would produce meat in its muscles from those nutrients and amino acids. The same thing can happen in a vat to grow the same cow cell into actual meat. Not kind of meat, not plant-based meat that's like meat—it's meat. It's the same cell. It tastes exactly the same.

Twenty-five years ago, in 2003, it was the first time humans had ever cracked or understood the human genome. It took three billion dollars and 15 years to do it. The cost of sequencing a genome has been driven down from three billion dollars to a thousand dollars. It's now at the point where it's about a hundred dollars, and eventually it's going to keep driving down to 50 dollars or essentially nothing.

It's not just cheaper—it's twice as fast. We can now design these biological systems for outcomes we want to happen, cheaply and easily.

## Beyond Technology: Building a 21st-Century Civilization

The technology story of today—AI, clean energies, bioengineering—is familiar at some level. But I think the next several iterations require putting a bigger lens on what's going on. It gets us back to what we were describing: what's happening in America is a once-in-80-years reinvention. In fact, it's possible that what's going on here is the early days of building a 21st-century civilization.

When you think about that, you go beyond the technology. That's the foundation. The next thing up from technologies is thinking about what you could build with those technologies. What kind of economy would you want to build?

The economic system that the United States has been based on has worked for the top 10%—certainly for the top 1%—but it has not been working for 80% of the population. It's gotten to the point where they've had it.

As remarkable as it sounds, we could be at a point in the world right now, in 2025, where we are watching the beginnings of a shift from financial capitalism—born and raised out of the Enlightenment—to some version of sustainable capitalism.

We're going from a world of representative democracy, which was a brilliant move forward, to digital democracy. We're also going to go from a world of nation-states, which was a great breakthrough from empires and colonies of the past, to some kind of global governance that coordinates the 10 billion people on this planet.

That's the level of change I think we're actually heading into. That's the level of change your children are going to be wrestling with. That's the level of change America is going through now. The quicker we start to wrap our heads around that challenge and the scale of the reinvention we're up to, the better off we're all going to be.
