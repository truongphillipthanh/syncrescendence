America, the Land of Innovation
0:00
America,
0:06
the land of innovation, where invention shaped destiny
0:15
and technology helped dreams take flight.
0:21
At Bell Labs, the transistor was born, sparking the age of semiconductors and giving rise to Silicon Valley.
0:32
Hedy Lamarr reimagined communication, paving the way for wireless connectivity.
0:39
IBM's system 360 put a universal computer at the heart of industry.
0:46
Intel's microprocessor drove the digital age forward and Cray’s supercomputers expanded
0:54
the frontiers of science. So, we think we're at the beginning of something with this technology,
1:00
and we're going to go just as fast as we can. Apple made computing personal. Hello,
1:09
I imagine us. Microsoft opened the window to a new world of software. Long before the web,
1:18
you've got mail. US government researchers built ARPANET connecting the first computers,
1:24
the foundation for the internet. An iPod, a phone. Are you getting it? Then Apple again
1:34
put a thousand songs in your pocket and the internet in your hand. Every era a leap. We
1:41
choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but
1:48
because they are hard. Every leap America leap for mankind. Now the next era is here launched by a
1:59
revolutionary new computing model. This is likely going to be the most important contribution we've
2:04
made to the computer industry. It will likely be recognized as a revolution. Machine learning
2:12
is a branch of artificial intelligence. Computers that almost appear to think
2:20
amount of computational resource is ultimately what's going to turbocharge this field.
2:26
Artificial intelligence, the new industrial revolution.
2:33
At its heart, NVIDIA GPUs invented here in America. Like electricity and the internet,
2:41
AI is essential infrastructure. Every company will use it. Every nation will
2:48
build it. Winning this competition will be a test of our capacities unlike anything since
2:54
the dawn of the space age. And today, AI factories are rising. Built in America
3:03
for scientists, engineers, and dreamers across universities, startups, and industry. I think
3:13
we want to try to reach new heights as a civilization, discovering the nature of
3:18
the universe. And now, American innovators are clearing the way for abundance, saving lives,
3:31
shaping vision into reality,
3:36
lending us a hand, and delivering the future.
3:45
We will soon power it all with unlimited clean energy.
3:52
We will extend humanity's reach to the stars.
4:03
This is America's next Apollo moment. Together,
4:09
we take the next great leap to boldly go where no one has gone before.
4:19
And here is where it all begins.
Intro
4:29
Welcome to the stage, NVIDIA founder and CEO, Jensen Huang.
4:41
Washington D.C. Washington D.C. Welcome to GTC.
4:51
It's hard not to be sentimental and proud of America. I got to tell you that. Was that
4:56
video amazing? Thank you. NVIDIA's creative team does an amazing job. Welcome to GTC. We have a
5:05
lot to cover with you today. GTC is where we talk about industry, science, computing,
5:15
the present, and the future. So, I've got a lot to cover with you today, but before I start,
5:21
I want to thank all of our partners who helped sponsor this great event. You'll see all of them
5:28
around the show. They're here to meet with you and uh uh really great. We couldn't do what we do
5:34
without all of our ecosystem partners. This is the Super Bowl of AI, people say. And therefore, every
5:42
Super Bowl should have an amazing pregame show. What do you guys think about the pregame show and our all all star allstar athletes and allstar cast? Look at these guys. Somehow I turned out the
5:57
buffest. What do you guys think? I don't know if I had something to do with that. NVIDIA invented
GPU to CPU Accelerated Computing Shift
6:04
a new computing model for the first time in 60 years. As you saw in the video, a new computing
6:11
model rarely comes about. It takes an enormous amount of time and set of conditions. We observed,
6:19
we invented this computing model because we wanted to solve problems that generalpurpose computers,
6:25
normal computers could not. We also observed that someday transistors will continue the number of
6:32
transistors will grow but the performance and the power of transistors will slow down that Moore's
6:40
law will not continue beyond limited by the laws of physics and that moment has now arrived dinard
6:47
scaling has stopped it's called dinard scaling dinard scaling has stopped nearly a decade ago and in fact the transistor performance and its power associated ated has slowed tremendously and
6:59
yet the number of transistor continued. We made this observation a long time ago and for 30 years
7:04
we've been advancing this form of computing we call accelerated computing. We invented the GPU.
7:09
We invented the programming model called CUDA. And we observed that if we could add a
7:15
processor that takes advantage of more and more and more transistors, apply parallel computing,
7:22
add that to a sequential processing CPU that we could extend the capabilities of computing well
7:30
beyond well beyond. And that moment has really come. We have now seen that inflection point.
7:36
Accelerated computing its moment has now arrived. However, accelerated computing is a fundamentally
7:43
different programming model. You can't just take a CPU software software written by hand executing
7:50
sequentially and put it onto a GPU and have it run properly. In fact, if you just did that, it
7:57
actually runs slower. And so, you have to reinvent new algorithms. You have to create new libraries.
8:05
You have to in fact rewrite the application which is the reason why it's taken so long. It's taken
CUDA-X Libraries
8:12
us nearly 30 years to get here. But we did it one domain at a time. This is the treasure of
8:19
our company. Most people talk about the GPU. The GPU is important, but without a programming model
8:26
that sits on top of it, and without dedication to that programming model, keeping it compatible over
8:34
generations, we're now CUDA 13 coming up with CUDA 14, hundreds of millions of GPUs running
8:41
in every single computer, perfectly compatible. If we didn't do that, then developers wouldn't target
8:49
this computing platform. If we didn't create these libraries, then developers wouldn't know how to
8:56
use the algorithm and use the architecture to its fullest. One application after another. I mean,
9:02
these this is really the this is really the treasure of our company. cuLitho computational
9:07
lithography. It took us nearly seven years to get here with cuLitho and now TSMC uses it,
9:13
Samsung uses it, ASML uses it. This is an incredible library for computational lithography. the first step of making a chip. Sparse solvers for CAE applications. cuOpt, a
9:26
numerical optimization is broken just about every single record. The traveling salesperson problem,
9:32
how to connect millions of products with millions of customers in the supply chain. Warp Python
9:39
solver for CUDA for simulation. QDF a data frame approach basically accelerating SQL data frame
9:49
data frame databases. This library is the one that started AI al together CUDA, the
9:58
the library on top of it called Megatron Core made it possible for us to simulate and train extremely
10:05
large language models. The list goes on. Uh, Monai, really, really important, the number one
10:11
medical imaging AI framework in the world. Uh, by the way, we're not going to talk a lot about
10:17
health care today, but be sure to see Kimberly's keynote. She's going to talk a lot about the work
10:22
that we do in healthcare. And the list goes on. Uh, genomics processing, Ariel, pay attention.
10:29
We're going to do something really important here today. Um, cuQuantum quantum computing. This is just a representative of 350 different libraries in our company. And each one of these
10:40
libraries redesigned the algorithm necessary for accelerated computing. Each one of these libraries
10:46
made it possible for all of the ecosystem partners to take advantage of accelerated computing. And
10:52
each one of these libraries opened new markets for us. Let's take a look at what CUDA-X can do.
11:04
Ready, go.
CUDA Opens New Markets
14:01
Is that amazing? Every everything you saw was a simulation. There was no art,
14:10
no animation. This is the beauty of mathematics. This is deep computer science,
14:16
deep math. And it's just incredible how beautiful it is. Every industry was covered from healthcare
14:23
and life sciences to manufacturing, robotics, autonomous vehicles, computer graphics,
14:29
even video games. That first shot that you saw was the first application NVIDIA ever ran. And that's
14:38
where we started in 1993. And we kept believing in what we were trying to do. And it took,
14:44
it's hard to imagine that you could see that first virtual fighter scene come alive and that same
14:50
company believed that we would be here today. It's just a really, really incredible journey. I want to thank all the NVIDIA employees for everything that you've done. It's really incredible.
15:07
We have a lot of industries to cover today. I'm going to cover AI, 6G, quantum, models, enterprise
15:18
computing, robotics, and factories. Let's get started. We have a lot to cover, a lot of big
15:24
announcements to make, a lot of new partners that would very much surprise you. Telecommunications
15:30
is the backbone, the lifeblood of our economy, our industries, our national security. And yet ever
Telecommunications
15:40
since the beginning of wireless where we defined the technology, we defined the global standards,
15:46
we exported American technology all around the world so that the world can build on
15:53
top of American technology and standards. It has been a long time since that's happened.
15:59
wireless technology around the world largely today deployed on foreign technologies. Our
16:07
fundamental communication fabric built on foreign technologies. That has to stop and we have an
16:16
opportunity to do that especially during this fundamental platform shift. As you know computer
16:23
technology is at the foundation of literally every single industry. It is the single most important instrument of science. It's the single most important instrument of industry. And I just
16:34
said we're going through a platform shift. That platform shift should be the once-in-a-lifetime
16:40
opportunity for us to get back into the game for us to start innovating with American technology.
16:48
Today, today we're announcing that we're going to do that. We have a big partnership with Nokia.
16:56
Nokia is the second largest telecommunications maker in the world. It's a three trillion dollar
17:02
industry. Infrastructure is hundreds of billions of dollars. There are millions of base stations
17:08
around the world. If we could partner, we could build on top of this incredible new technology
17:17
fundamentally based on accelerated computing and AI. and for United States, for America to be at
17:24
the center of the next revolution in 6G. So today we're announcing that NVIDIA has a new product
17:31
line. It's called the NVIDIA Arc. The Aerial Radio Network Computer, Aerial RAM computer,
Nokia to Build AI-Native 6G on New NVIDIA Arc
17:40
Arc. Arc is built from three fundamental new technologies. the Grace CPU, the Blackwell GPU,
17:49
and our ConnectX Mellanox ConnectX networking designed for this application. And all of that
17:56
makes it possible for us to run this library, this CUDA-X library that I mentioned earlier
18:02
called Aerial. Ariel is essentially a wireless communication system running on top of CUDA X.
18:12
We're going to we're going to create for the first time a softwaredefined programmable computer
18:20
that's able to communicate wirelessly and do AI processing at the same time. This is completely
18:28
revolutionary. We call it NVIDIA Arc. And Nokia is going to work with us to integrate our technology,
18:36
rewrite their stack. This is a company with 7,000 fundamental essential 5G patents.
18:46
Hard to imagine any greater leader in telecommunications. So, we're going to partner with Nokia. They're going to make NVIDIA Arc their future base station. NVIDIA Arc is also compatible
19:00
with Airscale, the current Nokia base stations. So what that means is we're going to take this new
19:06
technology and we'll be able to upgrade millions of base stations around the world with 6G and AI.
19:15
Now 6G and AI is really quite fundamental in the sense that for the first time we'll be able
19:20
to use AI technology AI for RAN to make radio communications more spectral efficient doing
19:32
using artificial intelligence reinforcement learning adjusting the beam forming in real time in context depending on the surroundings and the traffic and the mobility the weather
19:43
all of that could be taken into account so that we could improve spectral efficiency. Spectral
19:48
efficiency consumes about 1 and a half to 2% of the world's power. So improving spectral
19:55
efficiency not only improves the amount of data we can put through wireless networks without
20:01
increasing the amount of energy necessary. The other thing that we could do AI for RAN
20:09
is AI on RAM. This is a brand new opportunity. Remember the internet enabled communications
20:18
but amazingly smart companies AWS built a cloud computing system on top of the internet. We are
20:26
now going to do the same thing on top of the wireless telecommunications network. This new
20:33
cloud will be an edge industrial robotics cloud. This is where AI on RAN the first is AI for RAN
20:44
to improve radio radio spectrum efficiency. The second is AI on RAN essentially cloud computing
20:52
for wireless telecommunications. Cloud computing will be able to go right out to the edge where
20:57
data centers are not are not because we have base stations all over the world. This announcement is
21:03
really exciting. Justin Hodari the CEO I think he's somewhere in the room. Thank you for your partnership. Thank you for helping United States bring telecommunication technology
21:13
back to America. This is really a fantastic, fantastic partnership. Thank you very much.
21:33
That's the best way to celebrate Nokia. Let's talk about quantum computing. 1981 particle physicist quantum physicist Richard Feman imagined
Quantum Computing
21:48
a new type of computer that can simulate nature directly to simulate nature directly because
21:56
nature is quantum. He called it a quantum computer. 40 years later the industry has
22:03
made a fundamental breakthrough. 40 years later, just last year, a fundamental breakthrough. It
22:09
is now possible to make one logical cubit. One logical cubit. One logical cubit that's coherent,
22:20
stable, and error corrected in past. Now that one logical cubit consists of could be sometimes tens,
22:28
sometimes hundreds of physical cubits all working together. As you know, cubits,
22:34
these particles are incredibly fragile. They could be unstable very easily. Any observation,
22:42
any sampling of it, any environmental condition causes it to become decoherent. And so,
22:48
it takes an extraordinarily well-controlled environments. And now also a lot of different
22:54
physical cubits for them to work together and for us to do error correction on these what are
23:01
called auxiliary or syndrome cubits for us to error correct them and infer what that logical
23:10
cubit state is. There are all kinds of different types of quantum computers. superconducting,
23:17
photonic, trapped ion, stable atom, all kinds of different ways to create a quantum computer.
23:25
Well, we now realize that it's essential for us to connect a quantum computer directly to
23:32
a GPU supercomputer so that we could do the error correction so that we could do the artificial intelligence calibration and control of the quantum computer and so that we could do
23:44
simulations collectively working together. the right algorithms running on the GPUs,
23:52
the right algorithms running on the QPUs and the two processors, the two computers
23:58
working side by side. This is the future of quantum computing. Let's take a look.
The Future of Quantum Computing
24:06
There are many ways to build a quantum computer. Each uses cubits, quantum bits as its core
24:13
building block. But no matter the method, all cubits, whether superconducting cubits, trapped
24:20
ions, neutral atoms, or photons, share the same challenge. They're fragile and extremely sensitive
24:27
to noise. Today's Qubits remain stable for only a few hundred operations. But solving meaningful
24:34
problems requires trillions of operations. The answer is quantum error correction. Measuring
24:41
disturbs a cubit which destroys the information inside it. The trick is to add extra cubits in
24:48
tangle so that measuring them gives us enough information to calculate where errors occurred without damaging the cubits we care about. It's brilliant but needs beyond
24:58
state-of-the-art conventional compute. That's why we built NVQLink, a new interconnect architecture
25:05
that directly connects quantum processors with NVIDIA GPUs. Quantum error correction requires
25:13
reading out information from QIDS, calculating where errors occur and sending data back
25:19
to correct them. NVQLink is capable of moving terabytes of data to and from quantum hardware,
25:26
the thousands of times every second needed for quantum error correction. At its heart is CUDA-Q,
25:34
our open platform for quantum GPU computing. Using NVQL link and CUDA-Q, researchers will be able to
25:41
do more than just error correction. They will also be able to orchestrate quantum devices and
25:46
AI supercomputers to run quantum GPU applications. Quantum computing won't replace classical systems.
25:55
They will work together fused into one accelerated quantum supercomputing platform.
26:09
Wow, this is a really long stage.
Announcing NVIDIA NVQLink Quantum-GPU Interconnect
26:17
You know, CEOs, we don't just sit at our desk typing. It's this is a physically job. Physical
26:23
job. So, so today we're announcing the NVQ link. NVQL link and it's made possible
26:29
by two things. Of course, this interconnect that does quantum computer control and calibration,
26:37
quantum error correction as well as connects two computers, the QPU and
26:43
our GPU supercomputers to do hybrid simulations.
26:50
It is also completely scalable. It doesn't just do error correction for today's number of few
26:55
cubits. It does error correction for tomorrow where we're going to essentially scale up these
27:01
quantum computers from the hundreds of cubits we have today to tens of thousands of cubits,
27:06
hundreds of thousands of cubits in the future. So we now have an architecture that can do control,
27:12
co- simulation, quantum error correction and scale into that future. The industry support has
27:20
been incredible between the invention of CUDA Q. Remember CUDA was designed for GPU CPU accelerated
27:30
computing. Basically using both processors to do use the right tool to do the right job. Now CUDA
27:37
Q has been extended beyond CUDA so that we could support QPU and have the two processors QPU and
27:44
the GPU work and have computation move back and forth within just a few microsconds. The essential
27:52
latency to be able to cooperate with the quantum computer. So now CUDA-Q is such an incredible
27:59
breakthrough adopted by so many different developers. We are announcing today 17 different
28:05
quantum computer industry companies supporting the NVQ link and and I'm so excited about this eight
28:15
different DOE labs. Berkeley, Brook Haven, Fermy Labs in Chicago, Lincoln Laboratory,
28:20
Los Alamos, Oakidge, Pacific Northwest, San Diego Lancho Lab, just about every single DOE
28:28
lab has engaged us working with our ecosystem of quantum computer companies and these quantum
28:34
controllers so that we could integrate quantum computing in into the future of science. Well,
Department of Energy Partnering with NVIDIA to Build 7 New AI Supercomputers
28:42
I have one more additional announcement to make. Today, we're announcing the Department of Energy
28:47
is partnering with NVIDIA to build seven new AI supercomputers to advance our nation's science.
29:02
I have to have a shout out for Secretary Chris Wright. He has brought so much energy to the DOE,
29:08
a surge of energy, a surge of passion to make sure that America leads science. Again, as I mentioned,
29:15
computing is the fundamental instrument of science and we are going through several platform shifts. On the one hand, we're going to accelerated computing. That's why every future
29:24
supercomputer will be GPUbased supercomputer. We're going to AI so that AI and principled
29:31
solvers, principled simulation, principal physics simulation is not going to go away. But it could be augmented, enhanced, scaled, use surrogate models, AI models working together. We
29:44
also know that principal solvers, classical computing could be enhanced to understand the
29:49
state of nature using quantum computing. We also know that in the future, we have so much signal,
29:56
so much data we have to sample from the world. Remote sensing is more important than ever.
30:02
And these laboratories are impossible to experiment at the scale and speed we need to
30:08
unless they're robotic factories, robotic laboratories. So all of these different
30:14
technologies are coming into science at exactly the same time. Secretary Wright understands this
30:19
and he wants the DOE to take this opportunity to supercharge themselves and make sure the
30:26
United States stay at the forefront of science. I want to thank all of you for that. Thank you.
AI - The New Industrial Revolution
30:36
Let's talk about AI. What is AI? Most people would say that AI is a chatbot and it it's
30:44
rightfully so. There's no question that Chat GPT is at the forefront of what people would
30:51
consider AI. However, just as you see right now, these scientific supercomputers are not
30:58
going to run chatbots. They're going to do basic science. Science, AI, the world of AI is much,
31:05
much more than a chatbot. Of course, the chatbot is extremely important and AGI is fundamentally
31:11
critical. Deep computer science, incredible computing, great breakthroughs are still
31:16
essential for AGI. But beyond that, AI is a lot more. AI is in fact, I'm going to describe AI in
31:25
a couple different ways. This first way, the first way you think about AI is that it has completely
31:31
reinvented the computing stack. The way we used to do software was hand coding. Hand coding software
31:40
running on CPUs. Today AI is machine learning training data inensive programming if you will
31:51
trained and learned by AI that runs on a GPU. In order to make that happen, the entire computing
31:58
stack has changed. Notice you don't see Windows up here. You don't see CPU up here. You see a
32:05
whole different a whole fundamentally different stack. Everything from the need for energy. And
32:11
this is another area where our administration, President Trump gets deserves enormous credit.
32:17
His pro- energy initiative, his recognition that this industry needs energy to grow. It needs
32:24
energy to advance. and we need energy to win. His recognition of that and putting the weight of the
32:29
nation behind pro- energy growth completely changed the game. If this didn't happen,
32:35
we could have been in a bad situation and I want to thank President Trump for that.
32:44
On top of energy are these GPUs and these GPUs are connected into built into infrastructure that I'll
32:51
show you later. On top of this infrastructure which in consists of giant data centers like
32:57
easily many times the size of this room enormous amount of energy which then transfer transforms
33:05
the energy through this new machine called GPU supercomputers to generate numbers. These
33:12
numbers are called tokens. the language, if you will, the computational unit, the vocabulary
33:20
of artificial intelligence. You can tokenize almost anything. You can tokenize, of course, the English word. You can tokenize images. That's the reason why you're able to recognize images
33:30
or generate images, tokenize video, tokenize 3D structures. You could tokenize chemicals
33:36
and proteins and genes. You could tokenize cells, tokenize almost anything with structure, anything
33:43
with information content. Once you could tokenize it, AI can learn that language and the meaning of
33:52
it. Once it learns the meaning of that language, it can translate. It can respond just like you
34:00
respond just like you interact with chat GPT. And it could generate just as chat GPD can generate.
34:06
So all of the fundamental things that you see Chad GPD do, all you have to do is imagine what
34:12
if it was a protein, what if it was a chemical, what if it was a 3D structure like a factory,
34:18
what if it was a robot and the token was understanding behavior and tokenizing motion
34:26
and action. All of those concepts are basically the same, which is the reason why AI is making
34:34
such extraordinary progress. And on top of these models are applications transformers. Transformers
34:42
is not a universal model. It's an incredibly effective model. But there's no one universal
34:48
model. It's just that AI has universal impact. There are so many different types of models.
34:54
There's in the last several years we enjoyed the invention and went through the innovation
35:00
breakthroughs of multimodality. There's so many different types of models. There's CNN models,
35:07
competition neuronet network models, their state space models, their graph neuronet network models, multimodal models, of course, all the different tokenizations and token methods that I just
35:17
described. You could have models that are spatial and it's understanding optimized for
35:22
spatial awareness. You could have models that are optimized for long sequence recognizing subtle information over a long period of time. There are so many different types of models.
35:34
On top of these models architectures, on top of these model architectures are applications,
35:40
the software of the past. And this is a a profound understanding, a profound observation
35:46
of artificial intelligence that the software industry of the past was about creating tools.
35:53
Excel is a tool. Word is a tool. A web browser is a tool. The reason why I know these are tools is
36:01
because you use them. The tools industry, just as screwdrivers and hammers, the tools industry
36:08
is only so large. In the case of IT tools, they could be database tools. These IT tools is about
36:17
a trillion dollars or so. But AI is not a tool. AI is work. That is the profound difference.
36:28
AI is in fact workers that can actually use tools. One of the things I'm really excited about is the
36:36
work that Irvin's doing at Perplexity. Perplexity using web browsers to book vacations or do
36:43
shopping basically an AI using tools. Cursor is an AI anantic AI system that we use at NVIDIA. Every
36:51
single software engineer at NVIDIA uses cursor has improved our productivity tremendously. It's
36:57
basically a partner for every one of our software engineers to generate code and it uses a tool and
37:05
the tool it uses is called VS code. So cursor is an AI agentic AI system that uses VS code. Well,
37:13
all of these different industries, these different industries, whether it's chat bots or digital biology where we have AI assistant researchers or what is a robo taxi inside a robo taxi? Of course,
37:27
it's invisible, but obviously there's a AI chauffeur. That chauffeur is doing work and
37:36
the tool that it uses to do that work is the car. And so everything that we've made up until now,
37:44
the whole world, everything that we've made up until now are tools. Tools for us to use. For
37:49
the very first time, technology is now able to do work and help us be more productive. The list of
37:57
opportunities go on and on, which is the reason why AI addresses the segment of the economy that
38:05
it has never addressed. It is a few trillion dollars that sits underneath the tools of a
38:15
hundred trillion dollar global economy. Now for the first time AI is going to engage that
38:21
hundred trillion dollar economy and make it more productive, make it grow faster, make it larger.
38:27
We have a severe shortage of labor. Having AI that augments labor is going to help us grow. Now
38:35
what's interesting about this from a technology industry perspective also is that in addition to
38:40
the fact that AI is new technology that addresses new segments of the economy AI in itself is also
38:47
a new industry this token as I was explaining earlier these numbers after you tokenize all these
38:57
different modalities of information there's a factory that needs to produce these numbers unlike
39:03
the computer industry indry and the chip industry of the past. Notice if you look at the chip
39:09
industry of the past, the chip industry represents about 5 to 10% maybe less 5% or so of a multi-
39:20
trillion dollar few trillion dollar IT industry. And the reason for that is because it doesn't take
39:27
that much computation to use Excel. It doesn't take that much computation to use browsers. It
39:32
doesn't take that much computation to use Word. We do the computation. But in this new world,
39:40
there needs to be a computer that understands context all the time. It can't precomputee that
39:47
because every time you use the computer for AI, every time you ask the AI to do something, the context is different. So, it has to process all of that information. Environmental, for example, in
39:58
the case of a self-driving car, it has to process the context of the car. context processing. What
40:04
is the instruction you're asking the AI to do? Then it's got to go and break down the problem
40:09
step by step, reason about it, and come up with a plan and execute it. Every single one of that step
40:15
requires enormous number of tokens to be generated which is the reason why we need a new type of
40:21
system and I call it an AI factory. It's an AI factory for short. It's unlike a data center of
40:28
the past. It's an AI factory because this factory produces one thing unlike the data centers of the
40:36
past that does everything. Stores files for all of us, runs all kinds of different applications. You could use that data center like you can use your computer for all kinds of applications. You
40:45
could use it to play game one day. You could use it to browse the web. You could use it, you know, to do your accounting. And so that is a computer of the past, a universal generalpurpose computer.
40:56
The computer I'm talking about here is a factory. It runs basically one thing. It runs AI and its
41:02
purpose, its purpose is designed to produce tokens that are as valuable as possible,
41:09
meaning they have to be smart. And you want to produce these tokens at incredible rates because
41:14
when you ask an AI for something, you would like it to respond. And notice during peak hours,
41:22
these AIs are now responding slower and slower because it's got a lot of work to do for a lot
41:27
of people. And so you wanted to produce valuable tokens at incredible rates and you wanted to
41:33
produce it cost effectively. Every single word that I used are consistent with an AI factory,
41:39
with a car factory or any factory. It is absolutely a factory. And these factories,
41:45
these factories never existed before. And inside these factories are mountains and mountains of
41:51
chips. Which brings to today. What happened in the last couple years? And in fact, what happened this
42:00
last year? Something fairly profound happened this year. Actually, if you look in the beginning of
42:06
the year, everybody has some attitude about AI. That attitude is generally this is going to be
42:11
big. It's going to be the future. And somehow a few months ago, it kicked into turbocharge. And the reason for that is several things. The first is that we in the last couple years have
Three Scaling Laws
42:23
figured out how to make AI much much smarter. Rather than just pre-training, pre-training
42:29
basically says let's take all of the all of the information that humans have ever created. Let's give it to the AI to learn from. It's essentially memorization and generalization. It's no it's not
42:41
unlike going to school back when we were kids. the first stage of learning. Pre-training was
42:46
never meant just as preschool was never meant to be the end of education. Pre-training,
42:53
preschool was simply teaching you the basic skills of intelligence so that you can understand how to
43:00
learn everything else. Without vocabulary, without understanding of language and how to communicate,
43:07
how to think, it's impossible to learn everything else. The next is post-training. Post-training
43:13
after pre-training is teaching you skills. Skills to solve problem. Break down problems. Reason
43:19
about it. How to solve math problems. How to code. How to think about these problems step by step.
43:28
Use first principle reasoning. And then after that is where computation really kicks in. As you know
43:36
for many of us, you know, we went to school and that's in my case decades ago. But ever since I've
43:44
learned more, thought about more. And the reason for that is because we're constantly grounding oursel in new knowledge. We're constantly doing research and we're constantly thinking. Thinking
43:55
is really what intelligence is all about. And so now we have three fundamental technology skills.
44:01
We have these three technologies. Pre-training, which still requires enormous enormous amount of
44:07
computation. We now have post training which uses even more computation and now thinking
44:13
puts incredible amounts of computation load on the infrastructure because it's thinking on our
44:19
behalf for every single human. So the amount of computation necessary for AI to think inference
44:27
is really quite extraordinary. Now I used to hear people say that inference is easy. NVIDIA should do training. NVIDIA is going to do you know they are really good at this. So
44:36
they're going to do training. The inference was easy. How could thinking be easy? Regurgitating
44:43
memorized content is easy. Regurgitating the multiplication tables easy. Thinking is hard.
44:51
Which is the reason why these three scales, these three new scaling laws which is all of
44:57
it in in full steam has put so much pressure on the amount of computation. Now another thing has
45:03
happened from these three scaling laws. We get smarter models and these smarter models need more
45:09
compute. But when you get smarter models, you get more intelligence. People use it
45:25
as if anything happens. I want to be the first one out.
45:30
Jazz kick. I'm sure it's fine. Probably just lunch. My stomach. Was that me? And so,
45:39
so where was I? The smarter your models are, the smarter your models are, the more people use it.
45:46
It's now more grounded. It's able to reason. It's able to solve problems it never learn how
45:52
to solve before because it could do research. Go learn about it. come back, break it down, reason about how to solve your how to answer your question, how to solve your problem,
46:00
and go off and solve it. The amount of thinking is making the models more intelligent. The more intelligent it is, the more people use it. The more intelligent it is, the more computation
46:10
is necessary. But here's what happened. This last year, the AI industry turned the corner,
46:19
meaning that the AI models are now smart enough. They're making they're worthy. They're worthy to
46:26
pay for. NVIDIA pays for every license of Cursor. And we gladly do it. We gladly do it because
46:35
Curser is helping a several hundred,000 employee software engineer or AI researcher be many,
46:42
many times more productive. So, of course, we'd be more than happy to do that. These AI models have
46:48
become good enough that they are worthy to be paid for. Cursor, 11 Labs, Syntheasia, A Bridge, Open
46:56
Evidence, the list goes on. Of course, Open AI, of course, Claude. These models are now so good that
47:04
people are paying for it. And because people are paying for it and using more of it, and every time they use more of it, you need more compute. We now have two exponentials. These two exponentials,
47:16
one is the exponential compute requirement of the three scaling law. And the second exponential,
47:22
the more people, the smarter it is, the more people use it, the more people use it, the more computing it needs. Two exponentials now putting pressure on the world's computational resource
47:36
at exactly the time when I told you earlier that Moore's law has largely ended. And so the question
47:44
is what do we do? If we have these two exponential demands growing and if we don't if we don't find a
47:52
way to drive the cost down then this positive feedback system this circular feedback system
47:58
essentially called the virtuous cycle essential for almost any industry essential for any platform
48:05
industry. It was essential for NVIDIA. We have now reached the virtual cycle of CUDA. The more
48:13
applications, the more the more applications people create, the more valuable CUDA is. The
48:19
more valuable CUDA is, the more CUDA computers are purchased. The more CUDA computers are purchased,
48:24
more developers want to create applications for it. That virtual cycle for NVIDIA has now been
48:31
achieved after 30 years. We have achieved that also. 15 years later, we've achieved that for AI.
48:40
AI has now reached the virtual cycle and so the more you use it because the AI is smart
48:45
and we pay for it the more profit is generated the more profit generated the more computes put to on the on the grid the more compute is put into AI factories the more comput the AI
48:56
becomes smarter the smarter more more people use it more applications use it the more problems we
49:02
can solve this virtual cycle is now spinning what we need to do is drive the cost down tremendously
49:09
So that one the user experience is better when you prompt the AI it responds to you much faster and
49:16
two so that we keep this virtual cycle going by driving its cost down so that it could get
49:22
smarter so that more people use it so that so on so forth that virtual cycle is now spinning but
49:28
how do we do that when Moore's law has really reached this limit well the answer is called
49:34
co-design you can't just design chips and hope that things on on top of it is going to go faster.
49:43
The best you could do in designing chips is add I don't know 50% more transistors every couple
49:48
of years and if you added more transistors just you know we can add more transistors and TSMC's
49:54
got a lot of transistor incredible company we just keep adding more transistors however that's
49:59
all in percentages not exponentials we need to compound exponentials to keep this virtual cycle
Extreme Co-Design
50:07
going extreme code design is the only company in the world today that literally starts from
50:14
a blank sheet of paper and can think about new fundamental architecture, computer architecture,
50:20
new chips, new systems, new software, new model architecture and new applications all at the same
50:27
time. So many of the people in this room are here because you're different parts of that layer that different parts of that stack and working with NVIDIA. We fundamentally rearchitect
50:38
everything from the ground up and then because AI is such a large problem, we scale it up. We
50:46
created a whole computer, a computer for the first time that has scaled up into an entire
50:51
rack. That's one computer, one GPU. And then we scale it out by inventing a new AI Ethernet
50:58
technology we call Spectrum Ethernet. Everybody will say Ethernet is Ethernet. Ethernet is hardly
51:03
Ethernet. Ethernet spectrum X Ethernet is designed for AI performance and it's the reason why it's so
51:11
successful. And even that's not big enough. We'll fill this entire room of AI supercomputers and
51:18
GPUs. That's still not big enough because the number of applications and the number of users
51:24
for AI is continuing to grow exponentially. And we connect multiple of these data centers together and we call that scale across spectrum XGS gigascale X spectrum X gigascale XGS. By
51:40
doing so, we do code design at such a such an enormous level, such an extreme level that the
51:47
performance benefits are shocking. Not 50% better each generation, not 25% better each generation,
51:55
but much much more. This is the most extreme code-designed computer we've ever made and quite
Grace Blackwell NVL72 - "A Thinking Machine"
52:03
frankly made in modern times. Since the IBM system 360, I don't think a computer has been ground up,
52:10
reinvented like this ever. This system was incredibly hard to create. I'll show you the
52:17
benefits in just a second. But essentially what we've done, essentially what we've done, we've
52:23
created otherwise Hey Janine, you can come out. It's you have to have to meet me like halfway. All
52:36
right. So, this is kind of like Captain America shield. So, NVLink 72, NVLink72,
52:46
if we were to create one giant chip, one giant GPU, this is what it would look like. This is
52:53
the level of wafer scale processing we would have to do. It's incredible. All of this,
53:00
all of these chips are now put into one giant rack. Did I do that or did somebody else do that?
53:10
Into that one giant rack. You know, sometimes I don't feel like I'm up here by myself. Just
53:20
this one giant rack makes all of these chips work together as one. It's actually completely
53:26
incredible. And I'll show you the benefits of that. The way it looks is this. So, thanks, Janine. I I like this. All right, ladies and gentlemen, Janine Paul.
Extreme Co-Designed Blackwell NVL72
53:42
I got it. In the future next, I'm just going to go like Thor.
53:55
It's like when you're at home and and you can't reach the remote and you just go like this and
54:01
somebody brings it to you. That's Yeah. Same idea. It never happens to me. I'm just dreaming
54:09
about it. I'm just saying. Okay. So, so anyhow, anyhow, um we basically this is what we created
54:17
in the past. This is NVLink NVLink 8. Now, these models are so gigantic. The way we solve it is we
54:25
turn this model, this gigantic model, into a whole bunch of experts. It's a little bit like a team. And so, these experts are good at certain types of problems. And we collect a whole bunch of experts
54:34
together. And so, this giant multi-trillion dollar AI model has all these different experts and we
54:41
put all these different experts on a GPU. Now, this is NVLink 72. We could put all of the chips
54:49
into one giant fabric and every single expert can talk to each other. So the master the the primary
54:57
expert could talk to all of the true work and all of the necessary contexts and prompts and bunch of
55:03
data that we have to bunch of tokens that we have to send to all of the experts. The experts would
55:09
whichever one of the experts are selected to solve the answer would then go off and try to respond
55:16
and then it would go off and do that layer after layer after layer. Sometimes eight, sometimes
55:21
16 and sometimes these experts, sometimes 64, sometimes 256. But the point is there are more
55:27
and more and more experts. Well, here NVLink 72, we have 72 GPUs. And because of that, we could put
55:36
four experts in one GPU. The most important thing you need to do for each GPU is to generate tokens,
55:44
which is the amount of bandwidth that you have in HBM memory. We have one H one GPU generating
55:52
thinking for four experts versus here because each one of the computers can only put eight GPUs. We
56:00
have to put 32 experts into one GPU. So this one GPU has to think for 32 experts versus this system
56:09
each GPU only has to think for four. And because of that the speed difference is incredible. And
56:16
this just came out. This is the benchmark done by semi analysis. They do a really really thorough job and they benchmarked all of the GPUs that are benchmarkable and it turns out it's not that many.
56:28
If you look at the list of looks list of GPUs you could actually benchmark is like 90% NVIDIA. Okay.
56:35
And but so we're comparing ourselves to ourselves but the second best GPU in the world is the H200
56:40
and runs all the workload. Grace Blackwell per GPU is 10 times the performance. Now, how do you get
56:51
10 times the performance when it's only twice the number of transistors? Well, the answer is extreme
56:57
code design. And by understanding the nature of the future of AI models and we're thinking across
57:05
that entire stack, we can create architectures for the future. This is a big deal. It says we can now respond a lot faster. But this is even bigger deal. This next one, look at this. This
57:16
says that the lowest cost tokens in the world are generated by Grace Blackwell NVLink72. The most
57:26
expensive computer. On the one hand, GB200 is the most expensive computer. On the other hand, its
57:34
token generation capability is so great that it produces it at the lowest cost because the tokens
57:41
per second divided by the t by the total cost of ownership of Grace Blackwell is so good. It is
57:47
the lowest cost way to generate tokens. By doing so, delivering incredible performance, 10 times
57:53
the performance, incre delivering 10 times lower cost, that virtual cycle can continue. Which then
58:01
brings me to this one. I just saw this literally yesterday. This is uh the CSP capex. People are
CSP Capex Spend
58:09
asking me about capex these days and um this is a good way to look at it. In fact, the capex of the
58:14
top six CSPs and this one this one is Amazon, Corewave, Google, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle.
58:19
Okay, these CSPs together are going to invest this much in capex and I would I would tell you the
58:27
timing couldn't be better and the reason for that is now we have the Grace Blackwell NVLink72 in all
58:34
volume production supply chain everywhere in the world is manufacturing it. So we can now deliver
58:40
to all of them this new architecture so that the capex invests in instruments computers that
58:48
deliver the best TCO. Now underneath this there are two things that are going on. So when you
58:55
look at this it's actually fairly extraordinary and it's fairly extraordinary anyhow. But what's
59:01
happening under underneath is this there are two platform shifts happening at the same time.
59:09
One platform shift is going from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. Remember
59:14
accelerated computing as I mentioned to you before it does data processing, it does image processing, computer graphics, it does com comput computation of all kinds. It runs SQL, runs spark, it runs,
59:25
you know, you you ask it, you tell us what you need to have run, and I'm fairly certain we have an amazing library for you. You could be, you know, a data center trying to make masks
59:35
to manufacture semiconductors. we have a great library for you. And so underneath irrespective
59:42
of AI, the world is moving from general purpose computing to accelerated computing irrespective
59:47
of AI. And in fact, many of the CSPs already have services that have been here long ago before AI.
59:54
Remember, they were invented in the era of machine learning. classical machine learning
1:00:00
algorithms like XG Boost, algorithms like um uh data frames that are used for recommener systems,
1:00:07
collaborative filtering, content filtering, all of those technologies were created in the
1:00:12
old days of general purpose computing. Even those algorithms, even those architectures
1:00:18
are now better with accelerated computing. And so even without AI, the world's CSPs are going
1:00:25
to invest into acceleration. NVIDIA's GPU is the only GPU that can do all of that plus AI.
1:00:34
And ASIC might be able to do AI, but it can't do any of the others. NVIDIA could do all of that,
1:00:40
which explains why it is so safe to just lean into NVIDIA's architecture. We have now
1:00:48
reached our virtual cycle, our inflection point. And this is quite extraordinary.
1:00:54
I have many partners in the room and all of you are part of our supply chain and I know how hard
1:01:00
you guys are working. I want to thank all of you how hard you are working and thank you very much.
Exceptionally Strong Demand for Grace Blackwell NVL72
1:01:12
Now I'm going to show you why this is what's going on in our company's business. We're seeing
1:01:20
extraordinary growth for Grace Blackwell for all the reasons that I just mentioned. It's driven by
1:01:25
two exponentials. We now have visibility. I think we're probably the first technology company in
1:01:32
history to have visibility into half a trillion dollars of cumulative Blackwell and early ramps
1:01:41
of Rubin through 2026. And as you know, 2025 is not over yet and 2026 hasn't started. This
1:01:50
is how much business is on the books. Half a trillion dollars worth so far. Now, this is
1:01:58
out of that. We've already shipped 6 million of the Blackwells in the first several quarters. I
1:02:04
guess the first four quarters of production, three and a half quarters of production. We still have one more quarter to go for 2025. And then we have four quarters. So the next five quarters there's
1:02:15
$500 million $500 billion half a trillion dollars. That's five times the growth rate of Hopper. That
1:02:23
kind of tells you something. This is Hopper's entire life. This doesn't include China and and um and Asia. So this is just uh the West. Okay. This is just uh we're excluding China. So Hopper
1:02:36
in its entire life 4 million GPUs. Blackwell. Each one of the Blackwells has two GPUs in it
1:02:43
in one large package. 20 million GPUs of Blackwells in the early parts of Rubin.
1:02:50
Incredible growth. So, I want to thank all of our supply chain partners. Everybody, I know how hard you guys are working. I made a video to celebrate your work. Let's play it.
Blackwell: Made in America, Made for the World
1:03:05
The age of AI has begun. Blackwell is its engine, an engineering marvel. In Arizona,
1:03:14
it starts as a blank silicon wafer. Hundreds of chip processing and ultraviolet lithography steps
1:03:23
build up each of the 200 billion transistors layer by layer on a 12in wafer. In Indiana,
1:03:32
HBM stacks will be assembled in parallel. HBM memory dies with 1,024 IO's are fabricated using
1:03:40
advanced EUV technology through silicon via is used in the back end to connect 12 stacks of HBM
1:03:48
memory and base dye to produce HBM. Meanwhile, the wafer is scribed into individual Blackwell dye,
1:03:57
tested and sorted, separating the good dyes to move forward. The chip on wafer on substrate
1:04:04
process attaches 32 Blackwell dyes and 128 HBM stacks on a custom silicon interposer wafer.
1:04:15
Metal interconnect traces are etched directly into it, connecting Blackwell GPUs and HBM stacks into
1:04:22
each system and package unit, locking everything into place. Then the assembly is baked, molded,
1:04:30
and cured, creating the GB300 Blackwell Ultra Super Chip. In Texas, robots will work around
1:04:37
the clock to pick and place over 10,000 components onto the Grace Blackwell PCB.
1:04:44
In California, Connect X8 Super Nix for scaleout communications and Bluefield 3 DPUs for offloading
1:04:52
and accelerating networking, storage, and security are carefully assembled into GB300 compute trays.
1:05:03
NVLink is the breakthrough high-speed link that NVIDIA invented to connect multiple GPUs and scale
1:05:10
up into a massive virtual GPU. The NVLink switch tray is constructed with NVLink switch chips
1:05:18
providing 14.4 terabytes per second of all toall bandwidth. NVLink spines form a custom blindmated
1:05:27
back plane with 5,000 copper cables connecting all 72 Blackwells or 144 GPU dies into one giant GPU
1:05:36
delivering 130 tab per second of all to-all bandwidth nearly the global internet's peak
1:05:43
traffic. Skilled technicians assemble each of these parts into a rack scale AI supercomput.
1:05:53
In total, 1.2 million components, 2 m of copper cable, 130 trillion transistors, weighing nearly
1:06:02
2 tons. From silicon in Arizona and Indiana to systems in Texas, Blackwell and future NVIDIA AI
1:06:12
factory generations will be built in America, writing a new chapter in American history
1:06:19
and industry. America's return to making and reindustrialization, reignited by the age of AI.
1:06:31
The age of AI has begun. Made in America. Made for the world.
NVIDIA Extreme Co-Design Delivers X-Factors on One-Year Rhythm
1:06:50
We are manufacturing in America again. It is incredible. The first thing that
1:06:56
President Trump asked me for is bring manufacturing back. Bring manufacturing back because it's it's necessary for national security. bring manufacturing back because
1:07:04
we want the jobs and we want that part of the economy. And nine months later, nine months later, we are now manufacturing in full production Blackwell in Arizona.
1:07:21
Extreme Blackwell GB 200 NV Grace Blackwell NV72 extreme co-design gives us 10x
1:07:31
generationally. It's utterly incredible. Now, the part that's really incredible is this. This
1:07:36
is the first AI supercomput we made. This is in 2016 when I delivered it to a startup in
1:07:41
San Francisco which turned out to have been open AI. This was the computer. And in order to do the create that computer, we designed one chip. We designed one new chip in order
1:07:54
for us to do code design. Now, look at all of the chips we have to do. This is what it takes.
1:08:01
You're not going to take one chip and make a computer 10 times faster. That's not going
1:08:06
to happen. The way to make computers 10 times faster that we can keep increasing
1:08:11
the performance exponentially, we can keep driving cost down exponentially is extreme
1:08:16
code design and working on all these different chips at the same time. We now have Ruben back home. This is Ruben. This is the Vera Rubin and and Ruben. Ladies and gentlemen, Ruben
Vera Rubin Superchip, Vera Rubin Compute Tray, Vera Rubin CPX Compute Tray, BlueField-4, NVLink Switch Tray
1:08:36
This is this is our third generation NVLink 72 rack scale computer. Third generation GB200 was
1:08:44
the first one. All of our partners around the world, I know how hard you guys worked. It was insanely hard. It was insanely hard to do. Second generation, so much smoother. And this generation,
1:08:55
look at this. Completely cableless. completely cableless. And this is this is all back in the
1:09:03
lab now. This is the next generation Rubin. While we're shipping GB300's,
1:09:08
uh we're preparing Rubin to be in production. You know, this time next year, maybe slightly earlier. And so, every single year, we are going to come up with the most
1:09:18
extreme co-design system so that we can keep driving up performance and keep driving down
1:09:24
the token generation cost. Look at this. This is just an incredibly beautiful computer. Now,
1:09:34
so this is amazing. This is 100 pedlops. I know this doesn't mean anything. 100 pedlops,
1:09:42
but compared to the DGX1 I delivered to OpenAI 10 years ago, nine years ago, it's 100 times
1:09:51
the performance right here versus 100 times of that supercomput. A 100 times a 100 of those,
1:09:59
let's see, a hundred of those would be like 25 of these racks all replaced by this one thing. One
1:10:10
Vera Rubin. Okay. So this is this is the compute tray and this is so Vera Rubin super chip. Okay.
1:10:23
And this is the compute tray. This Oh right here. It's incredibly easy to install. Just
1:10:29
flip these things open, shove it in. Even I could do it. Okay. And this is the ver
1:10:35
Vera Rubin compute tray. If you decide you wanted to add a special processor,
1:10:40
we've added another processor. It's called its context processor because the amount of context that we give AIS are larger and larger. We wanted to read a whole bunch of PDFs before
1:10:49
it answered question. Wanted to read a whole bunch of archive papers, watch a whole bunch of videos, go learn all this before you answer a question for me. All of that context processing could be added.
1:10:59
And so you see on the bottom eight connectx9 new super nicks. You have CX you have uh CPXs eight
1:11:11
of them. You have uh BlueField 4 this new data processor two Vera CPUs and four Rubin packages
1:11:22
or eight Rubin GPUs. All of that in this one node, completely cableless, 100% liquid cooled.
1:11:31
And then this new processor, I won't talk too much about it today. I don't have enough time, but this is completely revolutionary. And the reason for that is because your AIs need to have more and
1:11:42
more memory. You're interacting with it more. You wanted to remember our last conversation. Everything that you've learned on my behalf, please don't forget it when I come back next time.
1:11:51
And so all of that memory is going to create this thing called KV caching. And that KV caching
1:11:58
retrieving it, you might have noticed every time you go into your your your AIS these days,
1:12:03
it takes longer and longer to refresh and retrieve all of the previous conversations and and the
1:12:08
reason for that is we need a revolutionary new processor and that's called BlueField 4. Next is
1:12:15
the the ConnectX switch, excuse me, the NVLink switch which is right here. Okay, this is the
1:12:22
NVLink switch. This is what makes it possible for us to con connect all of the computers together.
1:12:27
And this switch is now several times the bandwidth of the entire world's peak internet traffic. And
1:12:38
so that spine is going to communicate and carry all of that data simultaneously to all of the
1:12:44
GPUs. On top of that, on top of that, this is the this is the Spectrum X switch. And this Ethernet
1:12:53
switch was designed so that all of the processors could talk to each other at the same time and not
1:13:01
gum up the network. Gum up the network. That's very technical. Okay. So, um, so these are the
1:13:07
these three combined. And then this is the quantum switch. This is for Infiniband. This is Ethernet.
1:13:14
We don't care what language you would like to use, whatever standard you like to use. We have great scale out fabrics for you. Whether it's Infiniban or Quant or Spectrum Ethernet,
1:13:24
this one uses silicon photonics and is completely co-acked options. Basically, the laser comes right
1:13:30
up to the silicon and connects it to our chips. Okay. So, this is the Spectrum X Ethernet. And so,
1:13:37
now let's talk about Thank you. Oh, this is this is what it looks like. This is a rack. This is
1:13:44
two and a half. This is two uh 2000. This is two tons. 1.5 million parts. And the spine, this spine
1:13:55
right here carries the entire internet traffic in one second. Same speed moves across all of these
1:14:01
different processors. 100% liquid cooled. All for the, you know, fastest token generation rate in
1:14:09
the world. Okay, so that's what a rack looks like. Now that's one rack. A gigawatt data center would
1:14:16
have you know call it let's see 16 racks would be a thousand um and then 500 of those. So whatever
1:14:29
500 time 16 and so call it 9,000 of these 8,000 of these would be a one gigawatt data center. Okay.
1:14:39
And so that's a future AI factory. Now we used, as you notice, NVIDIA started out by designing
AI Factories
1:14:45
chips and then we started to design systems and we designed AI supercomputers. Now we're designing
1:14:51
entire AI factories. Every single time we move out and we integrate more of the problem to solve,
1:15:00
we come up with better solutions. We now build entire AI factories. This is going,
1:15:07
this AI factory is what we're building for Vera Rubin and we created a technology that makes it
1:15:15
possible for all of our partners to integrate into this factory digitally. Let me show it to you.
Omniverse DSX
1:15:25
The next industrial revolution is here and with it a new kind of factory. AI
1:15:35
infrastructure is an ecosystem scale challenge requiring hundreds of companies to collaborate.
1:15:45
NVIDIA Omniverse DSX is a blueprint for building and operating gigascale AI factories. For the
1:15:53
first time, the building, power, and cooling are co-designed with NVIDIA's AI infrastructure stack.
1:16:03
It starts in the Omniverse digital twin. Jacob's engineering optimizes compute density and
1:16:09
layout to maximize token generation according to power constraints. They aggregate SIM ready
1:16:17
open USD assets from Seammen's Schneider Electric Train and Vertive into PTC's product life cycle
1:16:26
management. Then simulate thermals and electricals with CUDA accelerated tools from EAB and Cadence.
1:16:39
Once designed, NVIDIA partners like Bectal and Vertive deliver pre-fabricated modules
1:16:47
factory-built, tested, and ready to plug in. This shrinks build time significantly,
1:16:54
achieving faster time to revenues. When the physical AI factory comes online, the digital
1:17:03
twin acts as an operating system. Engineers prompt AI agents from FIDRA and Emerald AI,
1:17:12
previously trained in the digital twin to optimize power consumption and reduce strain
1:17:17
on both the AI factory and the grid. In total, for a 1 gawatt AI factory, DSX optimizations can
1:17:27
deliver billions of dollars in additional revenue per year across Texas, Georgia, and Nevada.
1:17:37
NVIDIA's partners are bringing DSX to life. In Virginia, NVIDIA is building an AI factory
1:17:45
research center using DSX to test and productize Vera Rubin from infrastructure to software. With
1:17:55
DSX, NVIDIA partners around the world can build and bring up AI infrastructure faster than ever.
1:18:09
completely completely in digital long long before Vera Rubin exists as a real computer
1:18:16
we've been using it as a digital twin computer now long before these AI factories exist we
1:18:22
will use it we will design it we'll plan it we'll optimize it and we'll operate it as a
1:18:27
digital twin and so all of our partners that are working with us I'm incredibly happy for all of you supporting us And Gio is here and GE Vernova is here. Schneider, I I think um I think uh
1:18:41
uh Olivier is here. Olivier Blum is here. Siemens's incredible partners. Okay. Roland Bush,
1:18:49
I think he's watching. Hi Roland. And so anyways, uh really really great partners working with us.
1:18:56
In the beginning we had CUDA and we have all these different ecosystems of software partners. Now we have Omniverse DSX and we're building AI factories and again we have these incredible
1:19:06
ecosystem of partners working with us. Let's talk about models. Open source models particularly
Open Models
1:19:14
in the last couple years. Several things have happened. One, open source models have become
1:19:19
quite capable because of reasoning capabilities. It has become quite capable because they're multimodality and they're incredibly efficient because of distillation. So all these different
1:19:30
capabilities have become uh has made open source models for the very first time incredibly useful
1:19:35
for developers. They are now the lifeblood of startups. Lifeblood of startups in different
1:19:43
industries because obviously as I mentioned before each one of the industries have its own
1:19:48
use case it own use cases it own data it owned data its own flywheels. All of that capability,
1:19:54
that domain expertise needs to have the ability to embed into a model. Open source makes that
1:20:00
possible. Researchers need open-source. Developers need open-source. Companies around the world,
1:20:06
we need open source. Open- source models is really, really important. The United States has
1:20:13
to lead in open source as well. We have amazing proprietary models. We have amazing proprietary
1:20:18
models. We need also amazing open source models. Our country depends on it. Our startups depend
1:20:24
on it. And so NVIDIA is dedicating ourselves to go do that. We are now the largest the largest
1:20:31
we lead in open-source contribution. We have 23 models in leaderboards. We have all these
1:20:39
different domains from language models the physical AI models. I'm going to talk about robotics models to biolog biology models. Each one of these models has enor enormous teams and that's
1:20:50
one of the reasons why we built supercomputers for ourselves to enable all these models to be created. We have number one speech model, number one reasoning model, number one physical AI model.
1:21:00
The number of downloads is really really terrific. We are dedicated to this and the reason for that
1:21:06
is because science needs it, researchers need it, startups need it and companies need it.
NVIDIA is Everywhere
1:21:21
I'm delighted that AI startups build on NVIDIA. They do so for several reasons. One, of course,
1:21:27
our ecosystem is rich. Our tools work great. All of our tools work on all of our GPUs. Our GPUs
1:21:33
are everywhere. It's literally in every single cloud. It's available on prem. You could build it yourself. You could you could you know build up a an enthusiast gaming PC with multiple GPUs
1:21:44
in it and you could download our software stack and it it just works. We have the benefit of rich
1:21:50
developers who are making this ecosystem richer and richer and richer. So I'm really pleased with
1:21:55
all of the startups that we're working with. I'm I'm thankful for that. It is also the case that many of these startups are now starting to create even more ways to enjoy our GPUs. the Cordwaves,
1:22:07
Nscale, Nbius, Llama, Lambda, all of these companies, Crusoe companies are building these
1:22:16
new GPU clouds to serve the startups and I really appreciate that this is all possible because
1:22:22
NVIDIA is everywhere. We integrate our libraries. All of the CUDA X libraries I tal talked to you
1:22:28
about. All the open-source AI models that I talked about. All of the models that I talked about, we integrated into AWS, for example, really love working with Matt. We integrated into
1:22:38
Google Cloud, for example, really love working with Thomas. Each one of these clouds integrate
1:22:44
NVIDIA GPUs and our computing, our libraries as well as our models. Love working with Satia over
1:22:52
at Microsoft Azure. love working with uh Clay at Oracle. Each one of these clouds integrate
1:22:59
the NVIDIA stack. As a result, wherever you go, whichever cloud you use, it works incredibly.
1:23:06
We also integrate NVIDIA libraries into the world SAS so that each one of these SAS will eventually
1:23:14
become agentic SAS. I love Bill McDerman's vision for Service Now. There. Yeah, there you go.
1:23:22
I think that might have been Bill. Hi, Bill. And so, Service Now, what is it? 85% of the world's
1:23:29
enterprise workloads, workflows. SAP, 80% of the world's commerce. Christian Klein and I are
1:23:35
working together to integrate NVIDIA libraries, CUDA X and Nemo and Neotron, all of our AI systems
1:23:41
into SAP, working with Ceine over at Synopsis, accelerating the world CAE, CAD, EDA tools
1:23:49
so that they could be faster and could scale, helping them create AI agents. One of these days,
1:23:55
I would love to hire a AI agent, ASIC designers to work with our ASIC designers. essentially the
1:24:02
cursor of synopsis if you will. We're working with uh Annie Rude. Annie Rude here, I saw him
1:24:07
earlier today. He was part of the pregame show. Cadence doing incredible work accelerating their
1:24:12
stack creating AI agents so that we can have Cadence AI as designers and system designers
1:24:19
working with us. Today we're announcing a new one. AI will supercharge productivity. AI will
1:24:26
transform just about every industry. But AI will also supercharge cyber security challenges, the
1:24:35
bad AIs. And so we need an incredible defender. I can't imagine a better defender than CrowdStrike.
1:24:42
George George is here. Uh he was Yeah, I saw him earlier. We are partnering with CrowdStrike to
1:24:50
make cyber security speed of light to create a system that has cyber security AI agents in the
1:24:58
cloud but also incredibly good AI agents on prem or at the edge. This way you whenever there's a
1:25:05
threat you are moments away from detecting it. We need speed and we need a fast agentic AI super a
1:25:12
super smart AIs. I have a second announcement. This is the single fastest enterprise enterprise
1:25:20
company in the world. Probably the single most important enterprise stack in the world today.
1:25:26
Palunteer ontology. Anybody from Palunteer here? I was just talking to Alex earlier. This
1:25:34
is Palunteer ontology. They take information, they take data, they take human judgment and they turn
1:25:43
it into business insight. We work with Palantir to accelerate everything Palantir does so that
1:25:50
we could do data processing data processing at a much much larger scale and more speed whether
1:25:56
it's structured data of the past and of course we'll have structured data, human recorded data,
1:26:03
unstructured data and process that data for our government, for national security and for
1:26:11
enterprises around the world. process that data at speed of light and to find insight from it. This
1:26:17
is what it's going to look like in the future. Palunteer is going to integrate NVIDIA so that we could process at the speed of light and at extraordinary scale. Okay, NVIDIA and Palantir.
Physical AI
1:26:33
Let's talk about physical AI. Physical AI requires three computers just as it takes two computers to
1:26:41
train a language model. One that's to train it, evaluate it, and then inference it. Okay,
1:26:48
so that's the large GB 200 that you see. In order to do it for physical AI, you need
1:26:54
three computers. You need the computer to train it. This is GB the Grace Blackwell Invink 72.
1:27:01
We need a computer that does all of the simulations that I showed you earlier with
1:27:06
Omniverse DSX. It basically is a digital twin for the robot to learn how to be a good robot
1:27:14
and for the factory to essentially be a digital twin. That computer is the second computer,
1:27:20
the omniverse computer. This computer has to be incredibly good at generative AI and it has to
1:27:25
be good at computer graphics, sensor simulation, ray tracing, signal processing, this computer is
1:27:32
called the omniverse computer. And once we train the model, simulate that AI inside a digital twin
1:27:42
and that digital twin could be a digital twin of a factory as long as well as a whole bunch of digital twins of robots. Then you need to operate that robot. And this is the robotic computer. This
1:27:53
is this one goes into a self-driving car. Half of it could go into a robot. Okay? Or you could
1:27:59
actually have, you know, robots that are quite agile and quite quite fast in operations. And it might take two of these computers. And so this is the Thor Jetson Thor robotics computer. These
1:28:10
three computers all run CUDA. And it makes it possible for us to advance physical AI.
1:28:16
AI that understand the physical world, understand laws of physic, causality, permanence, you know,
1:28:26
physical AI. We have incredible partners working with us to create the physical AI of factories.
1:28:33
We're using it ourselves to create our factory in Texas. Now, once we create the robotic factory,
1:28:39
we have a bunch of robots that are inside it. And these robots also need the physical
1:28:45
AI applies physical AI and works inside the digital twin. Let's take a look at it.
America is Reindustrializing
1:28:53
America is re-industrializing, reshoring manufacturing across every industry. In Houston,
1:29:01
Texas, Foxconn is building a state-of-the-art robotic facility for manufacturing NVIDIA AI
1:29:07
infrastructure systems. With labor shortages and skills gaps, digitalization, robotics,
1:29:15
and physical AI are more important than ever, the factory is born digital in Omniverse.
1:29:27
Foxconn engineers assemble their virtual factory in a seaman's digital twin solution
1:29:33
developed on Omniverse Technologies. Every system, mechanical, electrical, plumbing,
1:29:39
is validated before construction. Siemens’ plant simulation runs design space exploration
1:29:46
optimizations to identify ideal layout. When a bottleneck appears, engineers update the
1:29:55
layout with changes managed by Seaman's team center. In Isaac sim, the same digital twin
1:30:04
is used to train and simulate robot AIS. In the assembly area, Fanic manipulators build GB300
1:30:14
tray modules by manual manipulators from FII and Skilled AI install bus bars into the trays and
1:30:25
AMRs shuttle the trays to the test pods. Then Foxconn uses Omniverse for large-scale sensor
1:30:33
simulation where robot AIs learn to work as a fleet. In Omniverse, vision AI agents built
1:30:42
on NVIDIA Metropolis and Cosmos. Watch the fleets of robots and workers from above to
1:30:49
monitor operations and alert Foxconn engineers of anomalies and safety violations. or even quality
1:31:00
issues. And to train new employees, agents power interactive AI coaches for easy worker onboarding.
1:31:13
The age of US re-industrialization is here with people and robots working together.
1:31:24
That's the the future of manufacturing, the future of factories. I want to thank our partner Foxconn Young Liu, the CEO, is here, but all of these ecosystem partners
1:31:34
make it possible for us to create the future of robotic factories. The factory is essentially a
1:31:40
robot that's orchestrating robots to build things that are robotic. You know this is
1:31:48
the amount of software necessary to do this is so intense that unless you could do it inside
1:31:54
a digital twin to dis to plan it to design it to operate inside a digital twin the hopes of
1:32:00
getting this to work is nearly impossible. I'm so happy to see also that Caterpillar,
1:32:05
my friend Joe Joe Creed and his hundred-year-old company is also incorporating digital twins in
1:32:13
the way they manufacture. Um these factories will have future robotic systems and one of the most
1:32:20
advanced is figure. Brett Atcock is here today. He just he founded a company three and a half years
1:32:26
ago. They're worth almost $40 billion. Today we're working together in training the the AI,
1:32:32
training the robot, simulating the robot and of course the robotic computer that goes into figure
1:32:39
really amazing. Uh I had the benefit of seeing it. Uh it's really quite quite extraordinary. It is very likely that humanoid robots and uh my friend Elon is also working on this that this
1:32:50
is likely going to be one of the largest consumer new consumer electronics markets and surely one of
1:32:57
the largest industrial equipment market. Peggy Johnson and the folks at Agility are working
1:33:03
with us on robots for warehouse automation. the folks at Johnson Johnson working with us again
1:33:10
training the robot, simulating it in digital twins and also operating the robot. These John
1:33:17
Johnson and Johnson surgical robots are even going to perform surgery that are completely
1:33:22
noninvasive surgery at a precision the world's never seen before. And of course,
1:33:28
the cutest robot ever, the cutest robot ever, the Disney robot. And this is this is
1:33:35
um something really close to our heart. We're working with Disney research on a entirely new
1:33:43
framework and sim simulation platform uh based on revolutionary technology called Newton. And
1:33:49
that Newton uh simulator makes it possible for the the robot to learn how to be a good
1:33:55
robot inside a physically aware physically based environment. Let's take a look at it.
Humanoid Robotics
1:34:56
blue. Ladies and gentlemen, Disney Blue. Tell me that's not adorable. He's not adorable. We
1:35:04
all want one. We all want one. Now, remember everything you were just seeing, that is not
1:35:10
animation. It's not a movie. It's a simulation. That simulation is an omniverse. Omniverse,
1:35:16
the digital twin. So these digital twins of factories, digital twins of warehouses,
1:35:22
digital twins of surgical rooms, digital twins where Blue could learn how to manipulate and
1:35:29
navigate and you know interact with the world. All completely done in real time. This is going
1:35:35
to be the largest consumer electronics product line in the world. Some of them are just really
1:35:40
working incredibly well now. This is a future of human or robotics and of course Blue. Okay.
Global Automakers Adopt NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion
1:35:56
Now, human robots is still in development. But meanwhile, there's one robot that is clearly at
1:36:05
an inflection point and it is basically here and that is a robot on wheels. This is arobo taxi.
1:36:14
A robotaxi is essentially an AI chauffeur. Now, one of the things that we're doing today, we're
1:36:19
announcing the NVIDIA drive Hyperion. This is a big deal. We created this architecture so that
1:36:27
every car company in the world could create cars, vehicles could be commercial, could be passenger,
1:36:34
could be dedicated to robotaxi. Create vehicles that are robo taxi ready. The sensor suite with
1:36:43
surround cameras and radars and LAR make it possible for us to achieve the highest level of
1:36:51
surround cocoon sensor perception and redundancy necessary for the highest level of safety.
1:36:57
Hyperion drive drive Hyperion is now designed into Lucid Mercedes-Benz my friend Ola Källenius
1:37:06
um the folks at Stellantis and there are many other cars coming and once you have a basic standard
1:37:12
platform then developers of AV systems and there's so many talented ones Wayve, Waabi, Aurora, Momenta
1:37:21
Neuro there's so many of them we ride there's so many of them that can then take their AV
1:37:27
system and run it on the standard chassis. Basically, the standard chassis has now become
1:37:33
a computing platform on wheels. And because it's standard and the sensor suite is comprehensive,
1:37:39
all of them could deploy their AI to it. Let's take a quick look.
NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion and Uber Partnership
1:38:22
Okay, that's the be that's beautiful San Francisco. And as you could see, as you could see, robo taxis inflection point is about to get here. And in the future,
1:38:32
a trillion miles a year that are driven, a 100 million cars made each year. There's some
1:38:38
50 million taxis around the world. It's going to be augmented by a whole bunch of robo taxis. So,
1:38:43
it's going to be a very large market to connect it and deploy it around the world. Today, we're announcing a partnership with Uber. Uber, Dara K, Dara K, Dara is going to we're
1:38:54
working together to connect these NVIDIA drive Hyperion cars into a global network and now in
1:39:02
the future you'll you know be able to hail up one of these cars and the ecosystem is going to be incredibly rich and we'll have Hyperion or Robotaxi cars all over the world. This is
1:39:12
going to be a new computing platform for us and I'm expecting it to be quite successful. Okay.
Close
1:39:23
So this is what we talked about today. We talked about a large large number of things we spoke
1:39:29
about. Remember at the core of this is two or two platform transitions from general purpose
1:39:36
computing to accelerated computing. NVIDIA CUDA and those suite of libraries called CUDA-X has enabled us to address practically every industry and we're at the inflection point. It is
1:39:48
now growing as a virtual cycle would suggest. The second inflection point is now upon us.
1:39:56
The second platform transition AI from classical handwritten software to artificial intelligence.
1:40:03
two platform transitioning happening at the same time which is the reason why we're feeling such incredible growth. quantum quantum computing. We spoke about open models. We spoke about we
1:40:15
spoke about enterprise with crowd strike and uh Palantir accelerating their platforms.
1:40:22
Uh we spoke about robotics a new potentially one of the largest consumer electronics and
1:40:28
industrial manufacturing sectors. And of course we spoke about 6G. NVIDIA has new platforms for
1:40:34
6G. We call it ARC. We have a new platform for robotics cars. We call that Hyperion. We have
1:40:43
new platforms even for factories. Two types of factories. The AI factory we call that DSX. And
1:40:53
then factories with AI we call that Mega. And so now we're also manufacturing in America.
1:41:01
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today and thank you for allowing me to bring
1:41:17
Thank Thank you for for allowing us to bring GTC to Washington DC. We're going to do it
1:41:22
hopefully every year. And thank you all for your service and making America great again. Thank you.
1:41:39
We start with a handshake. Solid and true. One step at a time,
1:41:44
we're breaking through. Brick by brick, we're stacking dreams high. Side by side,
1:41:51
we'll touch the sky. Handshakes and high hopes we're making our way. Shoulder to shoulder.
1:41:59
Come what may. Shared vision brighter than the sun. Friendship and business rolling as one.
1:42:14
Plans on paper but hearts in sink. Building together faster than you think. Laughter's
1:42:22
the glue in the grind we share. We've got the spark. We're going somewhere.
1:42:29
Handshakes and high hopes. We're making our way. Shoulder to shoulder. Come what
1:42:35
may. Shared vision brighter than the sun. Friendship and business. Handshakes and
1:42:44
high. We're making our way shoulder to come one way. Share vision brighter than the sun.
1:42:57
Business rolling as one.
