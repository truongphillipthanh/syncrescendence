We think it is plausible that by
0:02
September of next year we have sort of a
0:04
intern level AI research assistant and
0:07
that by March of 2028 we have like a a
0:10
legitimate AI researcher and this is the
0:12
core thrust of our research program.
0:13
Open AAI just finished their corporate
0:16
restructuring. They have a brand new
0:19
deal with Microsoft. They're continuing
0:21
their partnership and they did a live
0:23
stream and here's the thing. Sam Alman
0:25
and Jakob Pachaki gave an incredible Q&A
0:28
in which they revealed the exact date
0:32
for AGI. I couldn't believe they gave
0:35
such a precise date yet here we are. Let
0:37
me break down the entire live stream for
0:39
you. And a big thanks to Recraft for
0:41
sponsoring this video. More on them
0:43
later. So, first here is their timeline.
0:46
Look at this. We are here October 2025
0:49
in September 2026. Such a specific date.
0:54
automated AI research intern as they
0:56
describe it. Basically, a pretty good AI
0:59
researcher that can help facilitate AI
1:02
research. But here is where it gets
1:04
crazy. March 2028. It's hard for me to
1:09
imagine how they were able to come up
1:10
with such a precise date for this, but
1:13
automated AI research. Now, if you
1:15
remember back to the intelligence
1:17
explosion timeline from the situational
1:20
awareness paper, it actually came almost
1:24
at the exact time that open AI is
1:27
predicting. But when we have automated
1:30
AI research, then the acceleration of AI
1:35
is only limited by how much compute we
1:38
can throw at it. That is the time in
1:40
which we have what's shown here, the
1:42
intelligence explosion. And that is when
1:44
we rapidly hit super intelligence
1:47
shortly after. And so that is really
1:50
what open AI as a research lab is
1:53
heading towards. And I think that's
1:55
really what all of the frontier labs are
1:58
heading towards, which is whoever
2:00
reaches self-improving artificial
2:03
intelligence first just wins. Everyone
2:06
else loses. And that's because once you
2:08
hit self-improving AI, it's recursive.
2:11
it improves on its improvement and the
2:14
rate of improvement grows and once you
2:16
hit that how is anybody else supposed to
2:18
catch up and so that is why Mark
2:20
Zuckerberg is willing to misallocate
2:22
hundreds of billions of dollars because
2:24
the downside of missing the boat on AI
2:29
is far greater than a few measly
2:31
hundreds of billions of dollars and
2:33
obviously that's what Sam Alman believes
2:35
as well now another thing they covered
2:37
is the duration of automated tasks that
2:40
chatt And AI in general is able to
2:43
complete. And I keep hearing frontier
2:46
model companies talk about this. What
2:48
happens if AI can complete tasks
2:50
autonomously for 5 days or 5 months or 5
2:53
years? Well, that's what we're seeing
2:55
here. Right now, we can do 5 seconds, 5
2:58
minutes, 5 hours, but 5 days we're not
3:01
quite there. Then from there, we're
3:03
going to see five weeks, five months,
3:05
and fiveyear tasks. But of course, as
3:08
I've been saying for a while, it's not
3:09
just about the duration. It's about what
3:11
you can actually accomplish within that
3:13
duration. It's about how efficient you
3:15
can be with your token usage with the
3:18
compute during the duration. So again,
3:21
it's not just the duration. It is very
3:24
much about the efficiency as well. But
3:25
tying it back to the intelligence
3:27
explosion, remember at this point when
3:30
models can run autonomously for extended
3:32
periods of time, the only limiter, the
3:36
only thing preventing us from ramping up
3:38
the quality, from ramping up the
3:40
performance of artificial intelligence
3:42
is how much compute we can actually
3:44
throw at it. But of course, this type of
3:46
AI doesn't only need to be applied to AI
3:50
research. Imagine biomed research.
3:52
Imagine trying to have new material
3:55
science and drug discovery. All of these
3:58
things in which we have autonomous AI
4:01
researchers just completely running on
4:03
their own discovering incredible things
4:05
for humanity and the only thing we have
4:07
to do is provide it with sand and
4:09
electricity. And by the way, let me just
4:11
pause for a second and tell you about
4:12
the sponsor of today's video, Recraft.
4:15
Are you still wasting time jumping
4:16
between your AI chats and design canvas?
4:19
Recraft's new chat mode ends that for
4:22
good. So, imagine this. You generate a
4:24
logo, drag it into the chat, and say,
4:26
"Create a full brand kit from this.
4:29
Social posts, posters, mockups, all in
4:32
minutes." And at the end, you have a
4:34
consistent set of full brand assets that
4:36
you can use immediately. This is the
4:38
magic of Recraft's new chat mode. It's a
4:40
powerful AI chat assistant within
4:43
infinite canvas. Start in chat for
4:45
lightning fast exploration and then
4:47
switch to canvas for pixel perfect
4:49
control. No more switching between apps.
4:52
The entire creative process from first
4:54
prompt to final assets happens now in
4:57
one place. So stop just generating
4:59
images. Start creating with precision.
5:02
Join the beta chat mode weight list
5:04
today. Link in the description. Let them
5:06
know I sent you. Recraft has been a
5:08
phenomenal partner. Now back to the
5:10
video. The next thing I want to cover
5:12
from this live stream is what they call
5:13
chain of thought faithfulness. And it's
5:16
super interesting because I had not
5:18
heard OpenAI's thoughts on this before.
5:20
Let's watch it together and I'll give
5:22
you my thoughts along the way.
5:23
Starting from our first reasoning
5:24
models, we've been pursuing this new
5:26
direction interpretability. And the idea
5:28
is to keep parts of the model's internal
5:31
reasoning free from supervision. So
5:34
don't look at it during training and
5:38
thus let it remain representative of the
5:41
model's internal process. Um
5:45
so we refrain from from from kind of
5:49
guiding the model to think good thoughts
5:51
and and and and so let it let let it
5:54
remain a bit more faithful to to to what
5:57
it actually thinks. Right? And this is
5:58
not guaranteed to work of course, right?
6:01
we cannot make uh mathematical proofs
6:04
about deep learning and so this is
6:06
something we study. Uh but there are two
6:08
reasons to be optimistic. One reason is
6:10
that we have seen very promising
6:11
empirical results. Uh this is a
6:14
technology we employed a lot internally.
6:16
Uh we use this to understand um how our
6:20
models u um train h how their
6:25
propensities evolve over training.
6:27
So let me just describe what he's
6:28
talking about real quick. He is talking
6:30
about being able to trust the model to
6:33
have aligned models and look at their
6:36
chain of thought which is kind of the
6:37
reasoning steps they take before
6:39
providing you with an answer and having
6:41
trust that it is first aligned with
6:44
human incentives and it's actually
6:46
stating what it does really believe
6:49
rather than trying to react to what we
6:51
want it to believe and that'll make AI
6:53
in general much more safe and so to
6:56
really enable that kind of insight into
6:58
what the model's thinking. He's
7:00
basically saying, "Let the model run.
7:02
Let the model think and we're not going
7:04
to look at it along the way. We're going
7:05
to look at it after and see what it
7:07
thought without any human intervention
7:09
along the way."
7:10
And secondly, uh it is scalable and in
7:13
the sense that explicitly we make the
7:15
scalable objective not adversarial to
7:17
our ability to monitor the model. Um
7:21
and of course an objective not being
7:24
adversarial to the ability to monitor
7:26
the model is only half the battle. Um,
7:29
and you know, ideally you want it to to
7:31
to get it to help with monitoring the
7:33
model. And so this is something we're
7:34
we're researching quite heavily.
7:36
Um, but one important thing to
7:38
underscore about chain of thought
7:39
faithfulness is it's somewhat fragile.
7:42
Um it really requires drawing this clean
7:45
boundary uh and having this clear
7:47
abstraction uh and having restraint in
7:50
in what ways you can access the chain of
7:52
thought and this is something that is
7:54
present uh at OpenAI from algorithm
7:57
design to the way we design our products
7:59
right so so if you look at the chain of
8:02
thought summaries in CHP uh if we didn't
8:05
have the chain of summarizer if we just
8:07
make the chain of fully visible at all
8:09
times right that would make it kind part
8:11
of the overall experience and over time
8:13
it will be very difficult to not subject
8:15
it to any supervision.
8:17
Um and so long term we believe that by
8:19
preserving some amount of this
8:20
controlled privacy for the models uh we
8:23
can retain the ability to understand
8:25
their inner process.
8:26
I find that so interesting. He's
8:28
basically like because we're able to
8:30
give the models privacy. We're going to
8:33
leave them alone, allow them to think
8:35
what they want to think, it'll actually
8:38
give us more insights into how they
8:40
think. And I guess that makes sense, but
8:41
it's almost like treating these models
8:44
like a human. And that does rub me a
8:47
little bit the wrong way, but I find it
8:50
fascinating. Let's keep going.
8:51
And we believe this can be a very
8:53
impactful technique uh as we move
8:54
towards these very capable longunning
8:57
systems. Um I'll hand back to some.
9:00
Okay, that's very hard to follow uh with
9:02
the rest of this and obviously that's
9:04
the most important part of what we have
9:05
to say. But um you know just to to
9:07
reiterate uh we may be totally wrong. We
9:10
have set goals and missed them miserably
9:11
before. But with the picture we see, we
9:13
think it is plausible that by September
9:16
of next year, we have sort of a intern
9:19
level AI research assistant and that by
9:22
March of 2028, which I believe is almost
9:24
5 years to the month after the launch of
9:26
GPT4. Um, we have like a legitimate AI
9:30
researcher and this is the core thrust
9:31
of our research program.
9:32
All right. Next, he talks about OpenAI's
9:34
infrastructure plan. And to think that
9:36
they were grand before, well, let me go
9:39
through it with you right now. Again,
9:41
OpenAI's current infrastructure, current
9:44
30 plus GAWW currently being built, $1.4
9:49
trillion worth. A lot of people when
9:52
they saw his original Stargate plan for
9:55
7 trillion in funding to build out the
9:58
greatest AI infrastructure in the world
10:01
laughed. They thought 7 trillion, that
10:03
that's a mistake, right? That can't be
10:05
right. Well, he's already $1.4 trillion
10:08
of the way there. Crazy. And so the
10:11
thing he's going to talk about next is
10:13
building a factory to build AI
10:16
factories. It is not enough just to
10:19
build the factories. You have to build
10:20
the factory that builds the other
10:21
factories. And what they are talking
10:23
about internally, not committed to yet,
10:25
is a gigawatt per week coming out of a
10:28
factory that can produce that, which is
10:30
insane. And here is their first true
10:33
mention of robotics. Let me play this
10:35
clip.
10:35
To do this will require a ton of
10:37
innovation, a ton of partnerships,
10:39
obviously a lot of revenue growth. Um,
10:41
we'll have to repurpose our thoughts
10:43
about robotics to help us build data
10:44
centers instead of doing all the other
10:46
things. Um, but this is where we'd like
10:48
to go and over the coming months we are
10:50
going to do a lot of work to see if we
10:51
can get here. Um, it will be some time
10:53
before we're in a financial position
10:55
where we could actually pull the trigger
10:56
and get going on this.
10:57
All right. Next, he talks about the new
10:59
structure of Open AI. Remember, there
11:02
was the for-profit, there was the
11:04
nonprofit, there was the drama with Elon
11:06
Musk, there was the public benefit
11:08
corporation, and now everything is
11:10
finalized. The relationship with
11:11
Microsoft is finalized. We know how much
11:13
they own. We know what that partnership
11:15
looks like. We know what the IP
11:16
ownership looks like. So, let me show
11:18
you. First, it is much more simple.
11:21
There's the OpenAI Foundation which is
11:23
the nonprofit and the Open AAI group
11:26
which is a public benefit corporation. A
11:28
public benefit corporation is a company
11:31
in which its mission is not only to
11:33
deliver shareholder value but also to
11:36
deliver some kind of other mission. An
11:38
example of that is Patagonia which I
11:40
believe is kind of the most famous
11:41
public benefit corporation at least
11:43
historically until now. Now here are
11:45
some interesting tidbits. The nonprofit
11:48
governs the public benefit corporation.
11:50
It owns 26% of PBC equity and a little
11:53
asterisk warrant to potentially receive
11:55
more equity in the future. Uses
11:58
resources of ownership and the PBC can
12:00
attract the resources required to
12:02
succeed at OpenAI's mission. What does
12:04
that mean? That means fundraising and
12:06
inevitably an IPO. And he says the
12:09
OpenAI Foundation is going to be the
12:12
biggest nonprofit ever. The OpenAI
12:14
Foundation is also making a $25 billion
12:17
commitment to two very important areas
12:20
of AI. One, health and curing diseases,
12:23
and two, AI resilience. And next, he
12:26
goes through a bunch of Q&A questions.
12:29
And some of them are very interesting,
12:30
and his answers are just as interesting.
12:32
So, the first question Sam Alman gets is
12:34
about advertising and addictiveness of
12:38
social products and how Sora seems to be
12:40
following that same path of products
12:43
like Facebook and Tik Tok and Instagram.
12:47
And here's what he thinks and he is very
12:49
honest about it. He says, "Yeah, I'm
12:51
very worried. Let's watch."
12:52
We're definitely worried about this. Uh
12:54
I worry about it not just for things
12:56
like Sora and Tik Tok and ads and chbt
12:59
which are maybe known problems that we
13:01
can design carefully but you know we
13:03
have certainly seen people develop
13:05
relationships with chatbots that we
13:07
didn't expect and there can clearly be
13:09
addictive behavior there given the
13:11
dynamics and competition in the in the
13:13
world. I suspect some companies will
13:15
offer very addictive new kinds of
13:17
products. Um and I think you'll have to
13:19
just judge us on our actions. We'll have
13:20
to you know we'll make some mistakes.
13:23
We'll try to roll back models that are
13:24
problematic. If we ship Sora and it
13:26
becomes super addictive and not about
13:28
creation, we'll, you know, cancel the
13:30
product and you'll you'll have to just
13:31
judge us on that. My hope and belief is
13:34
that we will not make the same mistakes
13:36
that companies before us have made. Uh I
13:38
don't think they meant to make them
13:39
either. It's uh you know, we're all kind
13:41
of discovering this together. We
13:43
probably will make new ones, though, and
13:44
we'll just have to evolve quickly and
13:46
have a tight feedback loop. We we can
13:48
imagine all sorts of ways this
13:50
technology does incredible good in the
13:51
world. also obvious bad ones and um you
13:55
know we're guided by a mission where
13:56
we'll just continuously evolve evolve
13:58
the product.
13:59
All right. Next he gets asked if GPT40
14:02
is going to be around for a while.
14:03
We have no plans to sunset 40. Uh we are
14:07
not going to promise to keep it around
14:08
till the heat death of the universe
14:10
either. But we we understand that it's a
14:12
product that some of our users really
14:13
love. We also hope other people
14:15
understand why um it was not a model
14:18
that we thought was healthy for miners
14:20
to be using. Um, we hope that we build
14:23
better models over time that people like
14:25
more. You know, the people you have a
14:26
relationship with in your life, they
14:27
evolve and get smarter and change a
14:29
little bit over time. And we think that
14:31
we hope that the same thing will happen.
14:34
But yeah, no, no plans to uh no plans to
14:36
sunset for currently.
14:37
All right. Next, Yakob is going to be
14:39
asked when will AGI happen? I love this
14:42
and I love Sam just looking at him and
14:44
asking him the question. So, I'm going
14:46
to play that part real quick and then
14:47
give Yakob the chance to answer it.
14:49
Here's a good anonymous question for
14:51
Yakob. When will AGI happen?
14:54
Um, I think in in some number of years
14:57
we'll look back at these years and we'll
15:00
say, you know, this was kind of the
15:01
transition period when AGI happened. I
15:03
think as Sam said like early on adopting
15:05
we thought about AGI kind of emotionally
15:07
as this like thing that is like the kind
15:10
of ultimate solution of all the problems
15:12
and and and um it's it's this like
15:15
single point um for which there is
15:18
before and after I think um we found
15:22
that it's uh a bit more continuous than
15:23
that and so in particular for like
15:25
various kind of benchmarks that you know
15:27
seemed like kind of the obvious like
15:29
milestones towards AGI I think I think
15:31
we now think of them as kind of like
15:32
indicating like you know roughly how far
15:35
away we are in years. And so uh you know
15:38
if you look at a succession of of of of
15:40
milestones such as computers beating
15:42
humans at chess and then at go and then
15:46
uh you know computers being able to
15:47
speak in natural language and computers
15:49
being able to solve math problems right
15:52
I think well they clearly kind of get uh
15:54
closer together. I I would say I think
15:56
it's the AGI term has become hugely
15:59
overloaded and as Jakob said it'll be
16:00
this process over a number of years that
16:03
we're in the middle of. Uh but one of
16:05
the reasons we wanted to present what we
16:07
did today is I think it's much more
16:10
useful to say our intention our goal is
16:12
by March of 2028 to have a true
16:13
automated AI researcher and define what
16:15
that means uh than it is to sort of try
16:18
to you know satisfy everyone with a
16:20
definition of AGI. All right. So, next,
16:22
how about when GPT6? Let's watch.
16:24
Shindy says, "When GPT6?" I think I
16:27
think I think uh in time wise, maybe
16:29
that's more of a question for you. I
16:30
don't know either exactly when we'll
16:31
call it that, but I think a clear
16:33
message from us is say 6 months from
16:35
now, probably sooner. We expect to have
16:38
huge steps forward in model capability.
16:40
Next, Sam Alman is going to say, "When
16:42
we're going to get a Windows version of
16:43
Chachib Atlas,
16:45
when is Chacht Atlas for Windows
16:47
coming?" asks Lars. Uh I don't know an
