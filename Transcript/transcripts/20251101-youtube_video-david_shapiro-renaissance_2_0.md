# Renaissance 2.0: Why Open AI Models Signal a Democratic Revolution

Epoch AI recently published a graphic showing that open-weight models are about three to three and a half months behind state-of-the-art foundation models. We've known this for a while—this is nothing new except that the gap has reliably closed. For a while it was 6 to 18 months, and now it's down to 3 months. In my opinion, this is actually really good news for us as a civilization and as a species.

Let me play it out like this. In the dark timeline, AI would have been so arcane and so expensive that literally only a Manhattan 2.0 project could have cracked it. If that was the case, then it would have been a very tightly guarded secret. And when I say tightly guarded secret, I don't mean patent law—I mean the NSA and CIA would assassinate people to keep it inside the nation. China would have done the same. Russia would have done the same.

But that's not how we got it. Instead, it's a lot more like electricity and other inventions. Once you see that it's possible, it is very easy to understand. It's easy to reproduce and it's naturally moatless. That's one of the implications of the fact that numerous open-source projects reach parity with closed-source projects within a few months. We saw this as soon as OpenAI released their reasoning models—Deepseek and others duplicated that very quickly, and often with less money. Although there is some debate as to whether the Chinese models are just borrowing the data. Doing the new thing is hard, but once you know that it's possible, it's easy to duplicate and it's easy to duplicate it cheaper. But that's still the point: there's no moat.

What this means is that this technology is intrinsically democratic. You cannot put this genie back in the bottle. It is democratic by nature, but it is also inherently democratizing.

What I mean by that is it levels the playing field in the same way that once you industrialize a nation or a city, suddenly everyone has electricity, everyone has internal combustion engines. Those did have an industrial moat—you did need factories and expertise to set them up in the same way that you need data centers and expertise to set up AI. But at the same time, if every open-source shop and every university and every nation is able to spin up their own AI, well, then it's intrinsically democratizing. Now every individual or every small company can be just as smart as all the top people on Wall Street, every politician, every think tank, every university.

You might say, okay, well, we have no model for this. I disagree. I think we actually have several models for this.

Number one, the most recent one is the internet. The internet destroyed communication gatekeeping and democratized communication. We're still learning to live with the ramifications of that—the post-truth era, echo chambers, memetic warfare and all that other fun stuff. But before the internet, mass communication was limited to newspaper, radio, and cable networks. That made the world feel less chaotic, but it was more curated. Now, we have the unvarnished messiness of humanity at all times on doomscroll drip feeds. That's what I mean by we're still learning to live with that.

You might say, "Dave, that doesn't sound good." But also look at what the non-gatekeeping internet has given us, the democratizing of communication. You're able to listen to me because I don't need anyone's permission. Peter Diamandis calls it a permissionless disruptive innovation, a PDI—an innovation that there's no legal grounds to keep in check, and it's disruptive to the way that business is done or even the way that society works.

This also reminds me of the printing press. As you might recall from school, the printing press kicked off the Renaissance, among other things. Double-entry bookkeeping also helped spur the Renaissance along, as did glassmaking. There's a ton of inventions, but the printing press was one of the first ways of democratizing information and knowledge. To be fair, it took a few centuries for it to really kick off. One of the key inflection points where the printing press really dramatically altered the trajectory of civilization was during the French Revolution, or rather the leadup to the French Revolution. The ability to print pamphlets and share them and circulate them was a good way to circulate ideas about the Enlightenment. Once people got more and more ideas about rebuilding a republic and natural law and everything else that went into the Enlightenment—equality before the law—it became very compelling.

Likewise, we've seen the internet as a strong democratizing force. The Arab Spring, for example, and popular protests around the world. We just saw, I think it was Tibet or Nepal, had a youth uprising because of the internet. They tried to crack down on Discord. They actually elected a prime minister on Discord. I mean, come on—that is cool.

Artificial intelligence will utterly destroy intellectual gatekeeping. Between the printing press and the internet, we're doing another thing. Medical science, science broadly, news, political interpretation—AI is the best and greatest transparency technology we've ever created. And it cannot be controlled. You cannot put this genie back in the bottle.

What I'm saying is that AI in the long run will have a larger and faster impact on the trajectory of all of civilization and our species than the printing press and internet did combined. I would say that there's a good argument to call this the Renaissance 2.0. We are literally and really and truly at the beginning of a new renaissance.

Yes, it's messy. The Renaissance and the Enlightenment were very messy. Look at Italian history where the Renaissance really started, and then look at continental Europe, namely in France, where the late Renaissance really hit hard, and then look at the industrial revolutions that followed, namely in Britain. They were messy, but we're proud of that heritage. We say, "Hey, look, we were able to bootstrap ourselves as a civilization and launch ourselves clumsily and chaotically into the modern era." Hard things are worthwhile, and that makes them something to be proud of.

This is why I think that it is not hyperbolic to call this the Renaissance 2.0. The primary thing is just in interpreting what this data means. This data means that this technology is intrinsically open-sourced. It means that it is intrinsically moatless and it is intrinsically democratized. But also, as an intellectual superpower, it is intrinsically democratizing.

It's like the difference between having books and internet and not—it's a night and day difference what AI will ultimately do for the epistemic landscape of humanity.

I often called last year year zero. This year is the year of agents. Next year is the year of robots, and then 2027 is the year of superintelligence. It's also continuing to improve. This is another thing where any improvements to the printing press were relatively slow—and when I say slow, I mean they played out over decades or centuries. Improvements to the internet play out over the span of years, but improvements to artificial intelligence play out over the span of months. Not only is it a moving target—even if we froze AI where it is today, it's still going to have dramatic seismic shifts to society—but by the time any of the changes from today's technology settle in, we're going to be three or four new generations of AI ahead. And then the hardware is improving underneath that as well.

History will record this as a major inflection point, and we have the privilege of living through it. The privilege and the cost and the expense—every major change is painful. The level of pain has yet to be fully realized or understood. That's why people like me and plenty of others are doing what we do to try and help mitigate the pain and say, "Hey, there's a huge amount of opportunity here. There's also a huge amount of risk." But that's the name of the game. That is adapt or die, man.
