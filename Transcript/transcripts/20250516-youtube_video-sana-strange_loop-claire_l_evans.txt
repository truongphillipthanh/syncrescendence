[Applause] [Music] Anti-disciplinarian. I'm  going to steal that, it's really good. Well  
0:10
I'm going to start today with a provocation, maybe  a reductive one, that computers are rocks. That is  
0:16
their fundamental magic or maybe it's ours, that we  can draw these elements from deep within the earth,
0:22
silicon, tungsten, copper, and tin, and transform  them using labor, and capital, and language, and  
0:30
a lot of energy into tools for divination and  discovery. By miniaturaturizing them onto wafer  
0:37
thin chips, we have turned rocks into oracles,  and it's amazing, isn't it? What rocks have become?  
0:43
How far they've traveled from the depths of deep  geologic time to these accelerated calculations of  
0:50
contemporary computing. They've given us enough raw  computational power to do previously unimaginable  
0:56
things, like model the climate and discover and  synthesize unknown molecules, to send poetry  
1:02
spouting from chatbots. But there are limits to  what rocks can do. For one, the cold hard edge of  
1:10
physics is near. Miniaturization can only take us  so far. The cost of fabricating next generation  
1:17
computer chips grows more and more prohibitive  the closer we get to the limits of how small they  
1:22
can be. But there's also only so many rocks left to  do it with. Demand for the high purity silica sand  
1:30
that's used to make silicon chips is currently  causing a global and irreversible shortage of sand,  
1:36
and the supply chain for minerals commonly used  in smartphones, and batteries, and in computers  
1:42
fuels bloody conflict, and exploitation, and untold  political chaos around the world. So what comes  
1:48
next? After we've drawn blood from the final stone,  we're going to have no choice but to transcend  
1:55
this paradigm. To transcend these smart rocks, which  will take some adjustment because we're very used  
2:00
to them. But I think that in the future, rather  than silicon, tungsten, or tin, the computers of the  
2:07
future will have to be mined from a lot stranger  stuff. In fact, they may not be mined at all. They  
2:13
might be grown. And if that sounds weird to you,  then you've never met a slime mold. Fortunately,  
2:20
that's easy enough to correct. Unlike silica sand,  slime molds are abundant on this planet, and they  
2:25
tend to regenerate. Just go to your nearest forest,  i'm sure there's plenty around here, and turn over  
2:31
a log and look into the loam, and the damp, and the  rot—at that edge between life and decay, and you  
2:36
will find them. And when you do, you will probably  think that you're looking at a mushroom, a fungus  
2:41
of some kind, You wouldn't be the first to feel  that way. Slime molds have been miscatategorized,  
2:47
misunderstood throughout history. Their Latin  name is Mycetozoa. Myceto for mushroom, zoa for animal.  
2:55
So, some kind of fungal animal, which is unusual.  But they are not fungi, nor are they animals.  
3:02
They're something much much stranger. Acellular  organisms, as in having no cells at all, they have  
3:08
a truly unique physiology. The body of this  slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, is a single  
3:15
amorphous cell, this unctuous yellow, electric  yellow enveloping slime that harbors thousands  
3:22
of loose nuclei which pulse through the organism  in this rhythmic shuttle flow as it forages for  
3:27
resources in its environment. This allows it to  travel through its environment at a remarkably  
3:33
quick speed for such a small organism, at about a  millimeter per second and as it travels, it sends  
3:38
out these searching tentacles called pseudo pods  as it forages for food. And where it doesn't find  
3:44
food, it retreats those tentacles, leaving behind a  chemical trace called an extracellular slime that  
3:50
signals to the body not to return. Now, what's  interesting is that that trace, and the mold's  
3:56
inborn capacity to reread it, constitutes a form  of spatial memory in an organism which does not  
4:02
have a mind, which does not have a central nervous  system, no self-awareness, no knowledge that it's  
4:08
doing so, it can still explore and map its world  in staggering detail. And that means that this  
4:15
humble, humble organism in the right context  can solve mazes and design efficient networks,  
4:22
easily find the most efficient path between  different points on a map. It makes quick work  
4:28
of the U-shaped trap test that's usually used  to test autonomous robots and self-driving cars.  
4:33
It's modeled the roadways of ancient  Rome, charted new paths across the Moon  
4:39
and Mars, and traced a perfect copy of Japan's  interconnected railroad networks. It's expert at  
4:45
the kind of network optimization problems  that we call traveling salesman problems  
4:49
which, anybody in computer science knows, are  extremely difficult and extremely inefficient  
4:53
to solve using conventional computational means.  It doesn't use conventional computational means,  
4:59
it uses unconventional computational means,  something we call morphological computing. It  
5:04
thinks with form. It thinks with its body, and  for certain problems, specifically those which  
5:10
are really inefficient to solve using traditional  means, form is a really interesting way to think, a  
5:15
really useful way to think, and although it might  seem counterintuitive to us, it is able to think  
5:20
with a body and without a brain. Now, what does  that mean to think with a body and not a brain?  
5:26
I think one way to approach that question is to  look at the inverse—thinking with a brain and no  
5:31
body. And I think that's a fair enough description  of the aspirations of artificial intelligence, of  
5:36
deep learning, of the project of emulating  the synaptic connections of the human brain  
5:41
through artificial neural networks to create  AI systems. I mean, traditionally AI emerges from  
5:46
these models of the brain, because that's where  intelligence is, right? Well, it certainly is where  
5:52
some intelligence is. But if we actually look  at biology, we discover that intelligence is a lot  
5:57
more amorphous and weird than we think it is. For  one, I mean Physarum shows us that there are ways  
6:03
of thinking which transcend the brain entirely,  which are purely embodied, so when we consider  
6:08
the brain in isolation as though it was a brain  in a jar or of that, we're kind of ignoring that  
6:12
form of intelligence which, although primitive, is  highly useful in very specific circumstances. We're  
6:18
also ignoring that, even in humans, the brain is  situated in a body. And in that body, microorganisms  
6:25
outnumber human cells 10 to one. What do  those organisms know? How does their primitive  
6:30
intelligence guide our own? And what about our  other cells, our non-neural cells throughout  
6:36
our body. Do they have a form of knowing? Can they  remember? These are open questions in biology but  
6:42
what we're beginning to learn is really startling.  Because for decades the prevailing wisdom in  
6:47
neuroscience and biology has been that memory and  learning are consequences of synaptic plasticity,  
6:52
that the connections between clusters of neurons  that are simultaneously active during an experience  
6:58
strengthens the networks that persist, even  after that experience has passed, right? That's  
7:03
commonly expressed by the adage that neurons  that fire together, wire together. It's fundamental  
7:09
to our understanding of memory and cognition  in humans. It also obviously undergirds the  
7:14
design of artificial neural networks. But more and  more emergent biological research suggests that  
7:20
synaptic plasticity is just not the whole story  when it comes to intelligence. It doesn't explain  
7:25
things like the slime mold's very unique way of  mapping the world. It doesn't explain how far more  
7:31
humble cells, non-neural cells both within and  beyond the body, can also remember and learn. Now,  
7:40
memory takes many forms in the natural world, not  all of which we feel comfortable calling memory  
7:45
because we have a very affective human association  with that word, but if you look at bacteria, for  
7:50
example, all bacteria perform chemotaxis, which  is the process of traveling along chemical and  
7:56
temperature gradients to more ideal environments,  better conditions. Now, they wouldn't be able to  
8:03
do that without the capacity to compare their  present experience with their past experience.  
8:07
Bacteria do this in a very primitive way. It's  an aneural form of cognition but, like the slime  
8:12
mold's morphological computing, it does effectively  result in something like memory. In the realm of  
8:18
the eukaryotes, unicellular creatures have remarkable  capacities. This is the ciliate, Stentor roeselii. It's  
8:25
a unicellular pond dwelling creature. If you  irritate a Stentor roeselii with a little pipette of  
8:33
micro beads of plastic or a little jet of dye, it  will react like any living thing. The first thing  
8:39
it will do is turn away from the irritant. If that  doesn't do it, then it will reverse the direction  
8:45
of its ciliates, essentially spitting water at  its persecutor. If that doesn't work, then it will  
8:51
retract into its hold fast, which is its little  station that binds it to its environment. And if  
8:57
that doesn't work, and once it's well and truly  exasperated, it will detach from that hold fast  
9:02
and swim off to find more favorable conditions. Now,  this looks like animal behavior doesn't it? It's a  
9:07
hierarchy of reactions to an experience, each of  which requires prior knowledge of something that  
9:13
came before. You can't ratchet up your response to  an irritant if you don't know that the previous  
9:18
response didn't work, right? That also is memory. But  this is another creature which has no neurons, it  
9:25
has nothing but a single cell. But yet it retains  this awareness of past and present environmental  
9:31
conditions. And that awareness is something  that's present in many, maybe many, maybe
9:36
all non-neural cells. A study just last year  found that human kidney cells can remember, too.  
9:43
And not only that, they exhibit what's considered  to be a cornerstone of memory formation in humans,  
9:48
something called the mass spacing effect, which  essentially means that, like us, they remember  
9:53
experiences for longer if they've been exposed to  that information in spaced intervals rather than  
9:59
cramming it in all at once. So anyone who studied  for a test all one night before the test, and then  
10:03
forgotten everything a few days later, knows  about the mass spacing effect. It's universal  
10:08
um in people. It's also common across the animal  kingdom. Bees show it, fruit flies, sea slugs,  
10:15
birds, monkeys. And now, perhaps, we are learning  that it permeates actually down to the single  
10:22
cell, suggesting that these more basal forms of  cognition exist, more basal than neuroscience has  
10:28
previously acknowledged. That means, by implication,  that cognition is something that's everywhere. It's  
10:34
naturalized in life down to the smallest elements.  We're just now uncovering this and there's still  
10:40
so much that we don't know about how life knows,  and even those things that we do know, we struggle  
10:46
to capture and represent through computational  means. Take, for example, the microscopic roundworm  
10:52
c.elegans. It's one of the most closely  studied animals in all of biology, it's been  
10:58
a model organism in labs since the 1940s. We know  so much about it. We have maps of every single cell  
11:04
in its body, of the 302 neurons that constitute its  brain. We've mapped them with electron microscopes.  
11:10
We can use genetic imaging techniques to turn  those neurons individually off and on and see  
11:14
how the rest of the brain responds. We have a  complete wiring diagram of these 302 neurons  
11:20
that constitute its brain. 302 neurons compared  to our 82 billion, that's about as simple as a  
11:26
brain can be. So you would think that artificial  worm intelligence, I mean we've been talking a  
11:31
lot about AGI and ASI, but AWI should be right  around the corner, right? It should be crackable,  
11:37
but it's not. In fact, so far, the dynamic behavior  of these 302 neurons is essentially incomputable.  
11:44
Simulating it, simulating a c.elegans brain is  considered one of the thorniest and most like  
11:49
intractable problems in computational biology.  One researcher I spoke to for a piece I wrote  
11:53
about this told me that it was like a cathedral,  like, he didn't imagine it would ever be built in  
11:58
his lifetime, although he was happy to participate  in the project. It would take an enormous amount of  
12:03
data, good data, an enormous amount of compute, an  enormous amount of researchers, and collaboration,  
12:09
all to do something that a microscopic nematode  can do with nothing. And I think that's so humbling,  
12:15
isn't it? I think it's important to underline how  incapable sometimes, how inadequate our existing  
12:22
computational infrastructure is at expressing  the very basic and most simple things in nature.  
12:28
That's not to say it's not worth doing these  things. It is, because worm AI can be a stepping  
12:34
stone to fruitfly AI and a stepping stone  to rat AI and maybe someday a really full  
12:40
and robust understanding of how the human brain  works. We have to start somewhere. Lessons from  
12:45
the Physarum polycephalum slime mold, although a  humble organism, teach us a lot about how to build  
12:51
resilient networks. Mathematicians have simulated  Physarum's behavior to map the largest scale  
12:57
structures of the universe, the cosmic web. And on  a practical, material level, there are researchers  
13:02
in the field of unconventional computing who are  actually working to build hybrid biomputer chips  
13:07
using Physarum's body, by injecting those pseudo  pods with conductive nano particles to create  
13:14
really primitive and yet, completely sustainable,  biodegradable living computer chips. Now, these are  
13:19
speculative efforts, of course. Maybe mostly thought  experiments, but I think it really puts the whole  
13:25
smart rock thing into perspective. I think when we  start looking around us at the natural world, we  
13:30
can actually find a lot of interesting solutions  to our problems. We think our problems are unique  
13:37
and modern, but they're not. Only a few years ago,  a researcher at Stanford, Dr. Deborah Gordon, ant  
13:44
scientist, found that the, the regulating algorithm  that harvester ants use to determine how they will  
13:51
forage for resources across the Arizona desert is  functionally identical to TCP/IP, the transmission  
13:56
control protocol that we use to regulate data  traffic across the Internet. The Anternet, okay,  
14:03
I had to say it. But, does that mean that ants are  computer scientists? No, it just means that they've  
14:08
had millions of years to solve problems that  we've only had for a few decades. Why aren't we  
14:13
looking for more of these problems and with more  of these baked-in solutions? What other ideas can we  
14:18
borrow from nature. Because ants, and slime molds,  and worms, they're really useful model organisms  
14:24
in a laboratory context, but they are not unique  in the living world. As the computer scientist  
14:29
Selim Akul observes, computation is ubiquitous in the  universe. To be is to compute. And he's not speaking  
14:36
metaphorically, and neither are the biologists  who are increasingly using terms like algorithm  
14:40
or information processing or memory or compute to  talk about what they see in the field. Because what  
14:48
is computing, if you really strip it down? It's the  capacity to process input, in the case of a living  
14:54
organism, information about the environment. To  encode that information in memory, to retain that  
15:00
information through time, and then to act on that  information in order to change behavior and create  
15:05
new outputs, and then, ideally, to feed that output  back into the system and continually improve it,  
15:12
right. That's basic computing. It's also basic to  the evolutionary survival of any living thing.  
15:18
What we think of as computing, like operations in  silicon and tin, is really a specialized instance  
15:25
of a much more ancient and broad process. A  process that spans material substrates, and  
15:30
millennia, and fila, and exists at many degrees and  scales of complexity. Again, to be is to compute.  
15:40
Now, this is kind of the inverse of how we think  about computation now, right? Because since the  
15:43
invention of big data processing machines in  the mid- 20th century, we've really bent over  
15:48
backwards to make our world legible to them, right?  To compartmentalize all the complexity of nature,  
15:54
of life, of our world into this mathematical  logical world model. In that process, we've  
16:00
done a lot of amazing things, there's no denying  it, but we've also kind of diminished life. We've  
16:04
diminished that messiness and that capacity for  transformation and change that is inherent to life.  
16:10
Life is a dynamic process. It's not something that  can be easily reduced. It's something that emerges  
16:16
from the interaction of constituent parts at  multiple scales, right? It doesn't fit neatly  
16:22
into boxes. So if we built our technology from the  earth up to model these more primitive processes,  
16:29
the way that nature processes information, we  might not be jamming square pegs into round  
16:34
holes, we might have space for all that messiness  and that aliveness and that transformation. We've  
16:40
heard so much today about AI tools and agents, all  these fellow travelers with which we're going to  
16:47
share the coming decades, but we already have many  fellow travelers all around us in this world and  
16:52
within us, and they teach us a lot. They also  teach us the difference between representation  
16:57
and reality, by which I mean that AI systems are  trained on data. They're trained on words, symbols,  
17:04
images, code, sounds. These are representations of  the world. But intelligent living systems, living  
17:12
systems, are always engaged in a dynamic, material,  embodied relationship to reality. Physarum has no  
17:20
sensory organisms, organs with which it can  represent the world to itself, right? A cell  
17:25
cannot represent the world to itself. It can still  act, it can still negotiate with its environment  
17:30
physically, inviting its environment and this  ongoing give and take that is chemical, and tactile,  
17:38
and physical that's bound up in the consumption  and excretion of matter, the transformation of  
17:43
matter through digestion and decay. These ancient  processes, none of which operate in isolation,  
17:50
by the way, because life is a conversation.  All intelligence on Earth, all complexity,  
17:56
all information processing, be it human, slime, worm,  ant. It all emerged as the result of a very long  
18:02
and open-ended evolutionary dialogue. A process  through which every living thing found its mind  
18:09
in time in conversation with other minds and with  its environment. Anecdotally, neurons first evolved  
18:16
around the time that animals started eating each  other, so the fact that we have complex thought  
18:21
at all emerges from an evolutionary necessity to  be aware of the proximity of other animals, and  
18:27
that doesn't mean that intelligence is rooted  in hostility, by the way, because in so many  
18:31
cases, survival evading predation is a question of  collaboration and not necessarily competition. But  
18:39
evolution time and time again is the thing that  has brought us the complexity, the cognition that  
18:43
we seek from our computing systems, right? So why  not work towards intelligence from that direction,  
18:48
from the ground up rather than from the bottom  top down. It's the only way that we know has worked,  
18:54
you know, the fact that I'm up here talking to you  and you're all out here listening is evidence of
18:58
that. Our understanding of the living world has  always evolved alongside our technology itself and,  
19:08
for the first half of the 20th century, biology was  dominated by this mechanistic, linear, reductionist  
19:14
view of the world. This idea that the structure  of things determined their function, so cells  
19:20
were units, ants were automata in an inflexible  hierarchy. Life was something to be dissected , 
19:28
and examined, and taxonomized, and broken down  into its parts, and looked at under a microscope.  
19:33
Taken apart like a machine until it could be  understood. And that was a reflection of the  
19:39
computational paradigm of the time, as it always  is. But computing is a metaphor, and it does evolve.  
19:47
It can evolve alongside our understanding of life,  our understanding that life is a dynamic process  
19:52
that, again, is defined by interactions between  constituent parts, that it's not something that  
19:58
can be broken down. And I think as our computing  power has grown, our capacity to understand that  
20:04
has changed. Our capacity to model and simulate  living things has improved, and it's given birth  
20:10
to new ways of looking at the world. It's given  birth to new fields like complexity science or  
20:15
artificial life. And computing as a metaphor has  given biologists new language for talking about  
20:22
what living systems do. Language that brings us  together, ours and theirs. Language that helps  
20:29
us understand how life processes information and  preserves information in order to keep entropy at  
20:35
bay, which is life's fundamental magic. I would  like to express to you my hope for the future,  
20:45
which is also kind of a call to the deep past.  I really believe that we're getting closer and  
20:51
closer to bridging the gap between technology and  life, although the closer we examine that gap, the  
20:56
bigger it seems to get. I do believe that bridging  it is within the realm of capacity, perhaps it's  
21:01
the final cathedral that we'll have to build. And  I hope that once we've built it, it can save us  
21:06
from ourselves in a sense. I don't just mean that  someday I hope we'll have machines that I, or like  
21:12
I said at the beginning of this talk, are not mined but  grown. I hope that we can also use those machines  
21:17
for something to understand more deeply the  mechanisms of the living world, the patterns which  
21:24
underly its creativity and its resourcefulness.  Its mutualistic networks, its remarkable capacity  
21:31
to adapt to circumstances. Its relentless drive to  survive, to persist, to thrive in the face of all  
21:38
odds. I hope we might find a way to understand the  world using tools that are modeled after the world.  
21:45
Tools that are generative, resilient, even alive. Not  static and unforgiving or as unyielding as stone.  
21:55
Because that's when we can finally become what  we've always been meant to be, what we've always  
21:59
been, which is little more than a way for the  world to know itself. Thank you.
