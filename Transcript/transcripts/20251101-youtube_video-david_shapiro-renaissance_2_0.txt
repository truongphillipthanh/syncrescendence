Good morning everybody. David Shapiro
0:02
here. So today I want to talk about this
0:07
graphic from Epoch AI. So Epoch uh they
0:13
study and and do some really good data
0:15
on kind of you know objectively speaking
0:18
where is AI at and what is it doing? And
0:22
this particular graph um is really just
0:25
showing that uh open weight models are
0:28
about three to three and a half months
0:30
behind state-of-the-art foundation
0:32
models. Now, we've known this for a
0:35
while. This is nothing new except that
0:39
uh the gap has has pretty reliably
0:42
closed because for a while it was like 6
0:45
to 18 months and now it's down to 3
0:48
months. And the the point that I want to
0:51
make here is in my opinion this is
0:54
actually really good news for us as a
0:57
civilization and as a species. So let me
1:00
just play it out like this. In the dark
1:03
timeline,
1:05
uh AI would have been so arcane and so
1:08
expensive that literally only a
1:10
Manhattan 2.0 project could have cracked
1:13
it. And if that was the case, then it
1:15
would have been a very very tightly
1:17
guarded secret. And I when I say tightly
1:19
guarded secret, I don't mean like patent
1:21
law. I mean like you know NSA and CIA
1:24
would assassinate people to keep it to
1:26
keep all of it inside, you know, the the
1:29
nation and and China would have done the
1:31
same and Russia would have done the
1:32
same. Um and but that but that's not
1:36
that's not how we got it. Instead, it's
1:38
a lot more like electricity and other
1:41
inventions, which is once you see that
1:43
it's possible, it is very very easy to
1:45
understand. It's easy to reproduce and
1:48
it's naturally moatless. That's one of
1:50
the implications the fact that numerous
1:53
open- source projects uh reach parody
1:56
with closed source projects within a few
1:58
months. Uh we saw this with as soon as
2:00
open AAI released their reasoning
2:02
models, Deepseek and others duplicated
2:04
that um very quickly uh and often with
2:08
less money. Although, you know, it there
2:11
is some debate as to whether or not the
2:13
Chinese models are just borrowing the
2:15
data, right? You know, it's like, okay,
2:17
well, doing the new thing is hard. Um,
2:20
but then once you know that it's
2:21
possible, it's easy to duplicate and
2:22
it's easy to duplicate it cheaper. But
2:24
that's still kind of the point. There's
2:26
no moat. Um, and what this means is that
2:29
this this technology is intrinsically
2:31
democratic. You cannot put this genie
2:33
back in the bottle. It is it is
2:35
democratic by nature but it is also
2:37
inherently democratizing.
2:40
So what I mean by that is that it levels
2:42
the playing field in the same way that
2:45
you know once you industrialize a nation
2:47
or a city you know oh hey suddenly
2:49
everyone has electricity uh everyone has
2:52
internal combustion engines and those
2:54
did have an industrial moat like you did
2:56
need factories and and and expertise to
2:58
set them up in the same way that you
3:00
need data centers and expertise to set
3:02
up AI but at the same time if every
3:05
open- source shop and every university
3:07
and every nation is able to spin up
3:09
their own AI eyes. Well, then it's
3:11
intrinsically democratizing. So now
3:14
every individual or every small company
3:16
can be just as smart as all the top
3:18
people on Wall Street, every politician,
3:21
every think tank, every university.
3:24
Now you might say, okay, well, we have
3:25
no model for this. And and I disagree. I
3:27
think that we actually have several
3:28
models for this. So number one, the most
3:31
recent one is the internet. The internet
3:33
destroyed communication gatekeeping and
3:35
democratized communication. We're still
3:38
learning to live with the ramifications
3:40
of that. Uh, you know, with, you know,
3:42
post-truth era and echo chambers and,
3:45
you know, mimemetic warfare and all that
3:46
other fun stuff. Uh, but before the
3:49
internet, mass communication was limited
3:51
to newspaper, radio, and cable networks.
3:54
Uh, that made the world feel less
3:56
chaotic, but it was more curated. Now,
3:59
we have the unvarnished messiness of
4:01
humanity at all times on Doomcroll and
4:04
drip feeds. Uh, so that's what I mean by
4:06
we're still learning to live with that.
4:08
You might say, ' Dave, that doesn't
4:09
sound good. But also look at what the un
4:12
uh the the non-geatekeeping internet has
4:15
given us, the democratizing of
4:17
communication. You're able to listen to
4:19
me because I don't need anyone's
4:20
permission. Um Peter Diamandis calls it
4:24
a permissionless disruptive uh
4:25
innovation, a PDI, permissionless
4:27
disruptive innovation, which is an
4:30
innovation that there's no legal grounds
4:33
to keep it in in in check. Uh and it's
4:37
disruptive to the way that business is
4:38
done or or even the way that society
4:40
works. Now this also reminds me of the
4:43
printing press which you know if as you
4:45
might recall from school the printing
4:47
press kicked off the renaissance uh
4:50
amongst other things you know double
4:51
entry bookkeeping also helped you know
4:53
spur the renaissance along glass making
4:56
there's a ton of inventions but the
4:58
printing press was one of the first ways
5:01
of democratizing information and
5:03
knowledge and to be fair it took a few
5:06
centuries for it to really kick off one
5:08
of the key inflection points of where
5:11
the printing press really dramatically
5:13
altered the the trajectory of
5:14
civilization was during the French
5:17
Revolution or rather the leadup to the
5:18
French Revolution because the ability to
5:21
print pamphlets and share them and
5:22
circulate them was a good way to
5:25
circulate ideas about the Enlightenment
5:27
and people once they got more and more
5:29
ideas about, you know, rebuilding a
5:31
republic and uh and natural law and and
5:34
everything else that went into the
5:36
Enlightenment um you know equality
5:38
before the law. uh it became very very
5:41
compelling. Likewise, we've seen the
5:43
internet uh as a strong democratizing
5:46
force. Um you know the Arab Spring as a
5:48
as a as an example. Um but then also
5:51
popular protests around the world. We
5:53
just saw I think was it Tibet or Nepal
5:56
had a youth uprising because of the
5:58
internet because they tried to crack
5:59
down on Discord. They actually elected a
6:01
promp uh prime minister on Discord. I
6:04
mean come on that is cool.
6:07
So artificial intelligence will utterly
6:10
destroy intellectual gatekeeping again.
6:12
So between the printing press and the
6:14
internet, we're doing another thing. So
6:16
medical science, uh, science broadly,
6:18
news, political interpretation, AI is
6:22
the best and greatest transparency
6:24
technology we've ever created. And it
6:26
cannot be controlled. You cannot put
6:28
this genie back in the bottle. And so
6:31
what I'm saying is that AI in the long
6:33
run will have a larger and faster impact
6:36
on the trajectory of all of civilization
6:39
and our species than the printing press
6:42
and internet did combined. And so I
6:46
would say that there's a good argument
6:47
to call this the Renaissance 2.0 that we
6:50
are re literally and really and truly at
6:53
the beginning of a new renaissance. And
6:55
yes, it's messy. uh the Renaissance and
6:58
the Enlightenment were very messy. Look
7:00
at look at Italian history where the
7:02
Renaissance really started and then look
7:04
at uh continental Europe namely in
7:06
France where the Renaissance uh late
7:09
Renaissance really really hit hard and
7:11
then look at the industrial revolutions
7:13
that followed namely in Britain. They
7:16
were messy but we're proud of that
7:18
heritage. we say, "Hey, look, we were
7:20
able to bootstrap ourselves as a
7:22
civilization and and launch ourselves
7:25
clumsily and and chaotically into the
7:27
modern era." Um, and you know, hard
7:31
things are worthwhile and that makes
7:33
them uh that makes them something to be
7:35
proud of. Now, um, that's about where
7:38
I'll end off today, just to point out
7:40
like this is this is why I think that it
7:42
is not uh hyperbolic to call this the
7:46
Renaissance 2.0. Um and and the primary
7:50
thing is just in interpreting what does
7:52
this data mean? This data means that
7:54
this technology is intrinsically open-
7:57
sourced. It means that it is
7:58
intrinsically moless and it is
8:00
intrinsically democratized but also as
8:03
an intellectual superpower. It is
8:05
intrinsically democratizing.
8:07
You know it's like the difference
8:08
between you know having books and
8:10
internet and not uh it's night and day
8:12
difference what AI will ultimately do
8:14
for the epistemic landscape of humanity.
8:17
Now, of course, uh I often called last
8:20
year year zero. Um this year is kind of
8:23
the year of agents. Next year is the
8:25
year of robots and then 2027 is the year
8:28
of super intelligence. So, it's also
8:30
continuing to improve. This is another
8:32
thing where any improvements to the
8:34
printing press were relatively slow. I
8:36
mean, and when I say slow, I mean they
8:38
played out over decades or centuries. uh
8:40
improvements to the internet plays out
8:42
over the span of years, but improvements
8:45
to artificial intelligence plays out
8:47
over the span of months. Uh so not only
8:50
is it a moving target, meaning uh you
8:53
know, even if we froze AI where it is
8:55
today, it's still going to have dramatic
8:58
seismic shifts to society, but by the
9:01
time any of the changes from today's
9:03
technology settle in, we're going to be
9:05
three or four new generations of AI. And
9:08
then the hardware is improving
9:10
underneath that as well. So history will
9:13
record this as a major major inflection
9:16
point and we have the privilege of
9:18
living through it. Um you know the
9:20
privilege and and the the cost and the
9:23
expense um you know every every major
9:26
change is painful. Uh and and you know
9:30
the the level of pain um has yet to be
9:33
fully realized or understood. Um, and
9:36
that's why people like me and plenty of
9:37
others are doing what we do to try and
9:39
help mitigate the pain and say, "Hey,
9:41
there's a huge amount of opportunity
9:42
here. There's also a huge amount of
9:44
risk." Uh, but that's the name of the
9:46
game. That is adapt or die, man. So, all
9:49
right, that's my spiel for the day.
9:51
Thanks for listening. Take care,
9:53
everybody.
