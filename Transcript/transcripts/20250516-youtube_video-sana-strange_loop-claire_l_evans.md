# How the Universe Thinks Without a Brain

## The Magic of Rocks

I'll start with a provocation—perhaps a reductive one: computers are rocks. That's their fundamental magic, or perhaps it's ours. We can draw these elements from deep within the earth—silicon, tungsten, copper, and tin—and transform them using labor, capital, language, and an enormous amount of energy into tools for divination and discovery. By miniaturizing them onto wafer-thin chips, we have turned rocks into oracles, and it's remarkable. Consider the distance these stones have traveled: from the depths of deep geologic time to the accelerated calculations of contemporary computing.

This transformation has given us extraordinary computational power. We can now model the climate, discover and synthesize unknown molecules, send poetry spouting from chatbots. The achievement is undeniable.

But there are limits to what rocks can do.

The cold edge of physics looms near. Miniaturization can only go so far. The cost of fabricating next-generation computer chips grows exponentially more prohibitive as we approach the physical limits of miniaturization. Beyond that, there's another constraint: we're running out of rocks. The demand for high-purity silica sand used to make silicon chips is causing a global and irreversible shortage. The supply chain for minerals commonly used in smartphones, batteries, and computers fuels bloody conflict, exploitation, and untold political chaos around the world.

So what comes next? After we've extracted value from the final stone, we'll have no choice but to transcend this paradigm. We'll need to move beyond our reliance on these smart rocks—an adjustment that will require a fundamental shift in how we think about computation itself.

I believe the computers of the future won't be mined from silicon, tungsten, or tin. They may not be mined at all. They might be grown.

## The Slime Mold Solution

If that sounds strange, it's only because you've never met a slime mold. Unlike silica sand, slime molds are abundant on this planet, and they regenerate. Go to your nearest forest—there's almost certainly plenty nearby. Turn over a log and look into the loam, the damp, the rot—at that edge between life and decay—and you'll find them.

Most people mistake them for mushrooms or fungi. Slime molds have indeed been misunderstood throughout history. Their Latin name, *Mycetozoa*, means "fungal animal"—*myceto* for mushroom, *zoa* for animal. It's a misleading classification. They are not fungi, nor are they animals. They're something far stranger.

Slime molds are acellular organisms—they have no cells at all. They possess a truly unique physiology. *Physarum polycephalum*, the species I want to tell you about, has a body that is a single amorphous cell: an unctuous, electric yellow enveloping slime that harbors thousands of loose nuclei. These nuclei pulse through the organism in a rhythmic shuttle flow as it forages for resources in its environment. This physiology allows it to travel at a remarkably quick speed—about a millimeter per second—and as it travels, it extends searching tentacles called pseudopodia to forage for food. Where it doesn't find food, it retracts those tentacles, leaving behind a chemical trace called extracellular slime that signals to the body not to return.

Here's what's remarkable: that trace, combined with the mold's capacity to reread it, constitutes a form of spatial memory in an organism that has no mind, no central nervous system, no self-awareness. The slime mold doesn't know it's doing this, yet it can still explore and map its world in staggering detail.

This humble organism can solve mazes and design efficient networks. It easily finds the most efficient path between different points on a map. It makes quick work of the U-shaped trap test used to test autonomous robots and self-driving cars. It has modeled the roadways of ancient Rome, charted new paths across the Moon and Mars, and traced a perfect copy of Japan's interconnected railroad networks.

Slime molds are experts at network optimization problems—what computer scientists call traveling salesman problems. These are extremely difficult and inefficient to solve using conventional computational means. Yet the slime mold doesn't use conventional computation. It uses something we call morphological computing. It thinks with form. It thinks with its body.

For certain problems—specifically those that are really inefficient to solve using traditional means—form is a genuinely useful way to think. Although it might seem counterintuitive, the slime mold can think with a body and without a brain.

## Thinking Without a Brain

What does it mean to think with a body and not a brain? One way to approach that question is to look at the inverse: what does it mean to think with a brain and no body?

The *C. elegans* worm, *Caenorhabditis elegans*, is one of the most studied organisms on Earth. Its nervous system is fully mapped—all 302 neurons and roughly 7,000 synaptic connections. We know exactly how the wiring is organized. And yet, having this complete connectome doesn't give us complete understanding. There's something about the body, the embodiment, the material substrate through which the nervous system operates, that matters profoundly.

The slime mold demonstrates that morphological computing is possible. It's a kind of distributed cognition where the intelligence resides not in a central processor but in the physical properties of the organism itself. This represents an entirely different approach to solving problems—one where the solution emerges through the interaction of simple physical processes rather than through centralized command and control.

## Beyond the Neuron

Intelligence and memory don't require a brain. A single bacterial cell has no brain, no neurons, yet it possesses memory. Bacteria encode information chemically through modifications to their DNA—what researchers call the "mass spacing effect"—and pass this information forward through generations. This is a form of learning that operates entirely outside the neural paradigm. It's working memory, adaptive behavior, learned responses to environmental conditions, all mediated through chemistry rather than electricity.

The same is true of single-celled organisms more broadly. They respond to their environments, they adapt, they make what appear to be decisions. They do this despite having none of the neural infrastructure we've traditionally associated with cognition. Intelligence, in other words, is not localized to the brain. It's distributed throughout living systems.

## Computing as a Universal Principle

As the computer scientist Selim Akçar observes: computation is ubiquitous in the universe. To be is to compute. He's not speaking metaphorically, and neither are the biologists increasingly using terms like "algorithm," "information processing," "memory," and "compute" to describe what they observe in the field.

What is computing, stripped to its essence? It's the capacity to process input—in the case of a living organism, information about the environment. To encode that information in memory. To retain that information through time. Then to act on that information to change behavior and create new outputs. Ideally, to feed that output back into the system and continually improve it.

That's basic computing. It's also basic to the evolutionary survival of any living thing.

What we think of as computing—operations in silicon and tin—is really a specialized instance of a much more ancient and broad process. A process that spans different material substrates, millennia, and exists at many degrees and scales of complexity. Again: to be is to compute.

## Rethinking Technology and Life

This is, in some ways, the inverse of how we currently think about computation. Since the invention of large data processing machines in the mid-twentieth century, we've bent over backwards to make our world legible to them. We've compartmentalized all the complexity of nature, of life, of our world into mathematical logic models.

In doing this, we've accomplished remarkable things. But we've also diminished life. We've diminished that messiness and that capacity for transformation and change that is inherent to life itself. Life is a dynamic process. It's not something that can be easily reduced. It emerges from the interaction of constituent parts at multiple scales. It doesn't fit neatly into boxes.

If we built our technology from the ground up to model these more primitive processes—the way that nature processes information—we might not be jamming square pegs into round holes. We might have space for all that messiness, all that aliveness, all that capacity for transformation.

We've heard a great deal today about AI tools and agents, all these fellow travelers with which we'll share the coming decades. But we already have many fellow travelers all around us in this world, within us. They teach us something essential: the difference between representation and reality.

AI systems are trained on data—words, symbols, images, code, sounds. These are representations of the world. But living systems are always engaged in a dynamic, material, embodied relationship to reality. *Physarum* has no sensory organs with which to represent the world to itself. A cell cannot represent the world to itself. Yet it can still act. It can still negotiate with its environment physically, through an ongoing give and take that is chemical, tactile, and physical—bound up in the consumption and excretion of matter, in the transformation of matter through digestion and decay.

These ancient processes don't operate in isolation. Life is a conversation.

## Life as Emergent Conversation

All intelligence on Earth, all complexity, all information processing—human, slime, worm, ant—emerged as the result of a very long and open-ended evolutionary dialogue. A process through which every living thing found its mind in time through conversation with other minds and with its environment.

Anecdotally, neurons first evolved around the time animals started eating each other. The fact that we have complex thought at all emerges from an evolutionary necessity to be aware of the proximity of other animals. This doesn't mean intelligence is rooted in hostility. In many cases, survival and evasion of predation depend on collaboration rather than competition. But evolution has repeatedly brought us the complexity, the cognition that we seek from our computing systems.

Why not work towards intelligence from that direction? From the ground up, rather than top-down? It's the only way we know has worked. The fact that I'm here talking to you and you're all here listening is evidence of that.

## The Evolution of Metaphor

Our understanding of the living world has always evolved alongside our technology itself. For the first half of the twentieth century, biology was dominated by a mechanistic, linear, reductionist view. The idea that structure determined function: cells were units, ants were automata in an inflexible hierarchy. Life was something to be dissected, examined, taxonomized, broken down into its parts, and looked at under a microscope. Taken apart like a machine until it could be understood.

That was a reflection of the computational paradigm of the time. It always is. But computing is a metaphor, and metaphors evolve.

Computing can evolve alongside our understanding of life, our understanding that life is a dynamic process defined by interactions between constituent parts, something that cannot be broken down. As our computing power has grown, our capacity to understand this has changed. Our ability to model and simulate living things has improved, giving birth to new ways of seeing the world. New fields like complexity science and artificial life have emerged. Computing as a metaphor has given biologists new language for talking about what living systems do—language that brings us together, language that helps us understand how life processes and preserves information in order to keep entropy at bay, which is life's fundamental magic.

## A Bridging Hope

I would like to express my hope for the future, which is also, in a sense, a call to the deep past. I believe we're getting closer and closer to bridging the gap between technology and life. The closer we examine that gap, the bigger it seems to get, but I do believe that bridging it is within our capacity. It may be the final cathedral we'll have to build.

I don't just mean that someday I hope we'll have machines that are not mined but grown. I hope we can use those machines to understand more deeply the mechanisms of the living world—the patterns underlying its creativity and resourcefulness, its mutualistic networks, its remarkable capacity to adapt to circumstances, its relentless drive to survive, to persist, to thrive in the face of all odds.

I hope we might find a way to understand the world using tools that are modeled after the world. Tools that are generative, resilient, even alive. Not static and unforgiving or as unyielding as stone.

Because that's when we can finally become what we've always been meant to be, what we've always been: a way for the world to know itself.
