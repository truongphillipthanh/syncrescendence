AGI is still a decade away
0:48
Today I'm speaking with Andrej Karpathy. Andrej, why do you say that this will be   the decade of agents and not the year of agents? First of all, thank you for having me here. I'm  
0:58
excited to be here. The quote you've just  mentioned, "It's the decade of agents,"   is actually a reaction to a pre-existing quote. I'm not actually sure who said this but they were  
1:09
alluding to this being the year of agents with  respect to LLMs and how they were going to evolve. 
1:16
I was triggered by that because there's some  over-prediction going on in the industry. 
1:21
In my mind, this is more accurately  described as the decade of agents.  We have some very early agents that  are extremely impressive and that I  
1:28
use daily—Claude and Codex and so on—but I  still feel there's so much work to be done. 
1:35
My reaction is we'll be working  with these things for a decade.  They're going to get better,  and it's going to be wonderful. 
1:42
I was just reacting to the  timelines of the implication.  What do you think will take a decade to  accomplish? What are the bottlenecks? 
1:51
Actually making it work. When you're talking  about an agent, or what the labs have in mind   and maybe what I have in mind as well, you  should think of it almost like an employee or  
1:59
an intern that you would hire to work with you. For example, you work with some employees here.  When would you prefer to have an agent like  Claude or Codex do that work? Currently,  
2:08
of course they can't. What would it  take for them to be able to do that?  Why don't you do it today? The reason you don't do it  
2:13
today is because they just don't work. They don't have enough intelligence,   they're not multimodal enough, they  can't do computer use and all this stuff. 
2:20
They don't do a lot of the things you've  alluded to earlier. They don't have   continual learning. You can't just tell  them something and they'll remember it. 
2:27
They're cognitively lacking  and it's just not working.  It will take about a decade to  work through all of those issues. 
2:32
Interesting. As a professional podcaster  and a viewer of AI from afar, it's easy  
2:42
for me to identify what's lacking: continual  learning is lacking, or multimodality is lacking. 
2:47
But I don't really have a good way  of trying to put a timeline on it. 
2:52
If somebody asks how long continual learning  will take, I have no prior about whether  
2:57
this is a project that should take 5  years, 10 years, or 50 years. Why a   decade? Why not one year? Why not 50 years? This is where you get into a bit of my own  
3:07
intuition, and doing a bit of an extrapolation  with respect to my own experience in the field. 
3:14
I've been in AI for almost two decades. It's going to be 15 years or so, not that long. 
3:19
You had Richard Sutton here,  who was around for much longer.  I do have about 15 years of experience of people  making predictions, of seeing how they turned out. 
3:28
Also I was in the industry for  a while, I was in research,   and I've worked in the industry for a while.  I have a general intuition  that I have left from that. 
3:37
I feel like the problems are tractable, they're  surmountable, but they're still difficult. 
3:43
If I just average it out, it  just feels like a decade to me.  This is quite interesting. I want  to hear not only the history,  
3:50
but what people in the room felt was about to  happen at various different breakthrough moments. 
3:58
What were the ways in which their feelings were  either overly pessimistic or overly optimistic? 
4:03
Should we just go through each of them one by one? That's a giant question because you're talking   about 15 years of stuff that happened. AI is so wonderful because there have been  
4:10
a number of seismic shifts where the entire  field has suddenly looked a different way. 
4:17
I've maybe lived through two or three of those. I still think there will continue to be   some because they come with  almost surprising regularity. 
4:25
When my career began, when I started to work on  deep learning, when I became interested in deep   learning, this was by chance of being right next  to Geoff Hinton at the University of Toronto. 
4:34
Geoff Hinton, of course, is  the godfather figure of AI.  He was training all these neural networks. I thought it was incredible and interesting. 
4:40
This was not the main thing that  everyone in AI was doing by far.  This was a niche little subject on the side. That's maybe the first dramatic seismic shift  
4:49
that came with the AlexNet and so on. AlexNet reoriented everyone, and everyone   started to train neural networks, but it  was still very per-task, per specific task. 
4:59
Maybe I have an image classifier or I have a  neural machine translator or something like that.  People became very slowly interested in agents. People started to think, "Okay, maybe we have a  
5:10
check mark next to the visual cortex or something  like that, but what about the other parts of the   brain, and how can we get a full agent or a  full entity that can interact in the world?" 
5:19
The Atari deep reinforcement learning shift  in 2013 or so was part of that early effort  
5:26
of agents, in my mind, because it was an  attempt to try to get agents that not just   perceive the world, but also take actions and  interact and get rewards from environments. 
5:34
At the time, this was Atari games. I feel that was a misstep. 
5:39
It was a misstep that even the early OpenAI that  I was a part of adopted because at that time,  
5:45
the zeitgeist was reinforcement learning  environments, games, game playing,   beat games, get lots of different types of  games, and OpenAI was doing a lot of that. 
5:54
That was another prominent part of AI where maybe  for two or three or four years, everyone was doing  
6:01
reinforcement learning on games. That was all a bit of a misstep. 
6:06
What I was trying to do at OpenAI is  I was always a bit suspicious of games   as being this thing that would lead to AGI. Because in my mind, you want something like  
6:13
an accountant or something that's  interacting with the real world.  I just didn't see how games add up to it. My project at OpenAI, for example, was within the  
6:23
scope of the Universe project, on an agent that  was using keyboard and mouse to operate web pages. 
6:30
I really wanted to have something that  interacts with the actual digital world   that can do knowledge work. It just so turns out that this  
6:37
was extremely early, way too early, so early  that we shouldn't have been working on that.  Because if you're just stumbling your way around  and keyboard mashing and mouse clicking and trying  
6:47
to get rewards in these environments, your  reward is too sparse and you just won't learn.  You're going to burn a forest  computing, and you're never  
6:54
going to get something off the ground. What you're missing is this power of   representation in the neural network. For example, today people are training  
7:02
those computer-using agents, but they're  doing it on top of a large language model.  You have to get the language model first,  you have to get the representations first,  
7:08
and you have to do that by all the  pre-training and all the LLM stuff.  I feel maybe loosely speaking, people  kept trying to get the full thing too  
7:17
early a few times, where people really try  to go after agents too early, I would say.  That was Atari and Universe  and even my own experience. 
7:26
You actually have to do some things  first before you get to those agents.  Now the agents are a lot more competent, but maybe  we're still missing some parts of that stack. 
7:36
I would say those are the three major  buckets of what people were doing:   training neural nets per-tasks,  trying the first round of agents,  
7:44
and then maybe the LLMs and seeking the  representation power of the neural networks   before you tack on everything else on top. Interesting. If I were to steelman the Sutton  
7:54
perspective, it would be that humans  can just take on everything at once,   or even animals can take on everything at once. Animals are maybe a better example because they  
8:01
don't even have the scaffold of language. They just get thrown out into the world,   and they just have to make sense  of everything without any labels. 
8:10
The vision for AGI then should just be  something which looks at sensory data,   looks at the computer screen, and it just  figures out what's going on from scratch. 
8:18
If a human were put in a similar situation and  had to be trained from scratch… This is like a   human growing up or an animal growing up. Why shouldn't that be the vision for AI,  
8:26
rather than this thing where we're  doing millions of years of training?  That's a really good question. Sutton was  on your podcast and I saw the podcast and I  
8:35
had a write-up about that podcast that  gets into a bit of how I see things. 
8:41
I'm very careful to make analogies to  animals because they came about by a   very different optimization process. Animals are evolved, and they come  
8:49
with a huge amount of hardware that's built in. For example, my example in the post was the zebra. 
8:55
A zebra gets born, and a few minutes later  it's running around and following its mother.  That's an extremely complicated thing to do.  That's not reinforcement learning. That's  
9:03
something that's baked in. Evolution obviously  has some way of encoding the weights of our   neural nets in ATCGs, and I have no idea  how that works, but it apparently works. 
9:14
Brains just came from a very different process,  and I'm very hesitant to take inspiration from it  
9:20
because we're not actually running that process. In my post, I said we're not building animals. 
9:25
We're building ghosts or spirits or  whatever people want to call it, because  
9:31
we're not doing training by evolution. We're doing training by imitation of humans  
9:37
and the data that they've put on the Internet. You end up with these ethereal spirit entities  
9:42
because they're fully digital  and they're mimicking humans.  It's a different kind of intelligence. If you imagine a space of intelligences,  
9:48
we're starting off at a different point almost.  We're not really building animals. But it's also   possible to make them a bit more animal-like  over time, and I think we should be doing that.  
9:58
One more point. I do feel Sutton has a very... His framework is, "We want to build animals." 
10:04
I think that would be wonderful if we can  get that to work. That would be amazing.   If there were a single algorithm that you  can just run on the Internet and it learns  
10:13
everything, that would be incredible. I'm not sure that it exists and that's  
10:18
certainly not what animals do, because  animals have this outer loop of evolution. 
10:24
A lot of what looks like learning is  more like maturation of the brain.  I think there's very little  reinforcement learning for animals. 
10:32
A lot of the reinforcement learning is more  like motor tasks; it's not intelligence tasks.  So I actually kind of think humans  don’t really use RL, roughly speaking. 
10:41
Can you repeat the last sentence? A lot of that intelligence is   not motor task…it's what, sorry? A lot of the reinforcement learning, in my   perspective, would be things that are a lot more  motor-like, simple tasks like throwing a hoop. 
10:53
But I don't think that humans use reinforcement  learning for a lot of intelligence tasks   like problem-solving and so on. That doesn't mean we shouldn't  
11:01
do that for research, but I just feel  like that's what animals do or don't.  I'm going to take a second to digest that  because there are a lot of different ideas. 
11:09
Here’s one clarifying question I can  ask to understand the perspective. 
11:15
You suggest that evolution is doing  the kind of thing that pre-training   does in the sense of building something  which can then understand the world. 
11:24
The difference is that evolution  has to be titrated in the case   of humans through three gigabytes of DNA. That's very unlike the weights of a model. 
11:37
Literally, the weights of the model are  a brain, which obviously does not exist  
11:42
in the sperm and the egg. So it has to be grown.  Also, the information for every single  synapse in the brain simply cannot exist  
11:50
in the three gigabytes that exist in the DNA. Evolution seems closer to finding the algorithm   which then does the lifetime learning. Now, maybe the lifetime learning is  
12:00
not analogous to RL, to your point. Is that compatible with the thing you   were saying, or would you disagree with that? I think so. I would agree with you that there's  
12:06
some miraculous compression  going on because obviously,   the weights of the neural net are not stored  in ATCGs. There's some dramatic compression.  
12:14
There are some learning algorithms encoded that  take over and do some of the learning online.  I definitely agree with you on that. I would say I'm a lot more practically minded. 
12:23
I don't come at it from the  perspective of, let's build animals.  I come from it from the perspective  of, let's build useful things. 
12:28
I have a hard hat on, and I'm just  observing that we're not going to do   evolution, because I don't know how to do that. But it does turn out we can build these ghosts,  
12:36
spirit-like entities, by imitating internet  documents. This works. It's a way to bring you  
12:43
up to something that has a lot of built-in  knowledge and intelligence in some way,  
12:48
similar to maybe what evolution has done. That's why I call pre-training   this crappy evolution. It's the practically possible version  
12:56
with our technology and what we have available  to us to get to a starting point where we can do  
13:01
things like reinforcement learning and so on. Just to steelman the other perspective,   after doing this Sutton interview and thinking  about it a bit, he has an important point here. 
13:09
Evolution does not give us the knowledge, really. It gives us the algorithm to find the knowledge,   and that seems different from pre-training. Perhaps the perspective is that pre-training helps  
13:19
build the kind of entity which can learn better. It teaches meta-learning, and therefore   it is similar to finding an algorithm. But if it's "Evolution gives us knowledge,  
13:28
pre-training gives us knowledge,"  that analogy seems to break down.  It's subtle and I think you're right to  push back on it, but basically the thing  
13:35
that pre-training is doing, you're getting  the next-token predictor over the internet,   and you're training that into a neural net. It's doing two things that are unrelated. 
13:43
Number one, it's picking up all  this knowledge, as I call it.  Number two, it's actually becoming intelligent. By observing the algorithmic patterns in the  
13:51
internet, it boots up all these little circuits  and algorithms inside the neural net to do things   like in-context learning and all this stuff. You don't need or want the knowledge. 
14:00
I think that's probably holding back the neural  networks overall because it's getting them to rely   on the knowledge a little too much sometimes. For example, I feel agents, one thing they're  
14:09
not very good at, is going off the data  manifold of what exists on the internet.  If they had less knowledge or less  memory, maybe they would be better. 
14:17
What I think we have to do going forward—and  this would be part of the research paradigms—is  
14:23
figure out ways to remove some of the knowledge  and to keep what I call this cognitive core. 
14:28
It's this intelligent entity that is stripped from  knowledge but contains the algorithms and contains  
14:34
the magic of intelligence and problem-solving  and the strategies of it and all this stuff. 
14:39
There's so much interesting stuff there. Let's  start with in-context learning. This is an   obvious point, but I think it's worth just  saying it explicitly and meditating on it. 
14:48
The situation in which these models seem the most  intelligent—in which I talk to them and I'm like,  
14:53
"Wow, there's really something on the other end  that's responding to me thinking about things—is   if it makes a mistake it's like, "Oh wait, that's  the wrong way to think about it. I'm backing up."  
15:01
All that is happening in context. That's where I feel like the real   intelligence is that you can visibly see. That in-context learning process is  
15:10
developed by gradient descent on pre-training. It spontaneously meta-learns in-context learning,  
15:16
but the in-context learning itself is not  gradient descent, in the same way that our  
15:21
lifetime intelligence as humans to be able  to do things is conditioned by evolution   but our learning during our lifetime is  happening through some other process. 
15:30
I don't fully agree with that, but  you should continue your thought.  Well, I'm very curious to understand  how that analogy breaks down. 
15:36
I'm hesitant to say that in-context  learning is not doing gradient descent.  It's not doing explicit gradient descent. In-context learning is pattern completion  
15:47
within a token window. It just turns out that there's   a huge amount of patterns on the internet. You're right, the model learns to complete  
15:53
the pattern, and that's inside the weights. The weights of the neural network are trying   to discover patterns and complete the pattern. There's some adaptation that happens inside  
16:02
the neural network, which is magical  and just falls out from the internet   just because there's a lot of patterns. I will say that there have been some papers  
16:10
that I thought were interesting that look at  the mechanisms behind in-context learning.  I do think it's possible that in-context  learning runs a small gradient descent loop  
16:17
internally in the layers of the neural network. I recall one paper in particular where they were   doing linear regression using in-context learning. Your inputs into the neural network are XY pairs,  
16:30
XY, XY, XY that happen to be on the line. Then you do X and you expect Y.  The neural network, when you train it  in this way, does linear regression. 
16:41
Normally when you would run linear regression, you  have a small gradient descent optimizer that looks   at XY, looks at an error, calculates the gradient  of the weights and does the update a few times. 
16:50
It just turns out that when they looked at the  weights of that in-context learning algorithm,   they found some analogies to  gradient descent mechanics. 
16:59
In fact, I think the paper was even stronger  because they hardcoded the weights of a neural   network to do gradient descent through  attention and all the internals of the  
17:10
neural network. That's just my only pushback.  Who knows how in-context learning works,   but I think that it's probably doing a bit of some  funky gradient descent internally. I think that  
17:19
that's possible. I was only pushing back on your  saying that it's not doing in-context learning.  Who knows what it's doing, but it's probably maybe  doing something similar to it, but we don't know. 
17:28
So then it's worth thinking okay, if  in-context learning and pre-training  
17:34
are both implementing something like gradient  descent, why does it feel like with in-context   learning we're getting to this continual  learning, real intelligence-like thing? 
17:44
Whereas you don't get the analogous feeling just  from pre-training. You could argue that. If it's  
17:49
the same algorithm, what could be different? One way you could think about it is,   how much information does the model store  per information it receives from training? 
18:00
If you look at pre-training, if  you look at Llama 3 for example,   I think it's trained on 15 trillion tokens. If you look at the 70B model, that would  
18:10
be the equivalent of 0.07 bits per  token that it sees in pre-training,  
18:15
in terms of the information in the weights  of the model compared to the tokens it reads.  Whereas if you look at the KV cache  and how it grows per additional token  
18:22
in in-context learning, it's like 320 kilobytes. So that's a 35 million-fold difference in how much  
18:29
information per token is assimilated by the model. I wonder if that's relevant at all. 
18:34
I kind of agree. The way I usually put this is  that anything that happens during the training of   the neural network, the knowledge is only a hazy  recollection of what happened in training time. 
18:45
That's because the compression is dramatic. You're taking 15 trillion tokens and you're   compressing it to just your final neural  network of a few billion parameters. 
18:51
Obviously it's a massive  amount of compression going on.  So I refer to it as a hazy  recollection of the internet documents. 
18:57
Whereas anything that happens in the  context window of the neural network—you're   plugging in all the tokens and building up  all those KV cache representations—is very  
19:04
directly accessible to the neural net. So I compare the KV cache and the stuff   that happens at test time to  more like a working memory. 
19:11
All the stuff that's in the context window is  very directly accessible to the neural net.  There's always these almost surprising  analogies between LLMs and humans. 
19:21
I find them surprising because we're not  trying to build a human brain directly.  We're just finding that this  works and we're doing it. 
19:27
But I do think that anything  that's in the weights, it's a   hazy recollection of what you read a year ago. Anything that you give it as a context at test  
19:36
time is directly in the working memory. That's a very powerful analogy to   think through things. When you, for example,  
19:42
go to an LLM and you ask it about some book  and what happened in it, like Nick Lane's   book or something like that, the LLM will often  give you some stuff which is roughly correct. 
19:49
But if you give it the full chapter and ask it  questions, you're going to get much better results   because it's now loaded in the  working memory of the model. 
19:56
So a very long way of saying  I agree and that's why.  Stepping back, what is the part  about human intelligence that we  
20:03
have most failed to replicate with these models? 
20:12
Just a lot of it. So maybe one way to think  about it, I don't know if this is the best way,   but I almost feel like — again, making these  analogies imperfect as they are — we've stumbled  
20:22
by with the transformer neural network,  which is extremely powerful, very general.  You can train transformers on audio, or  video, or text, or whatever you want,  
20:31
and it just learns patterns and they're  very powerful, and it works really well.  That to me almost indicates that this  is some piece of cortical tissue. 
20:38
It's something like that, because the  cortex is famously very plastic as well.  You can rewire parts of brains. There were the slightly gruesome experiments  
20:48
with rewiring the visual cortex to the auditory  cortex, and this animal learned fine, et cetera. 
20:54
So I think that this is cortical tissue. I think when we're doing reasoning and   planning inside the neural networks, doing  reasoning traces for thinking models,  
21:04
that's kind of like the prefrontal cortex. Maybe those are like little checkmarks,  
21:11
but I still think there are many brain  parts and nuclei that are not explored.  For example, there's a basal ganglia doing a  bit of reinforcement learning when we fine-tune  
21:18
the models on reinforcement learning. But where's  the hippocampus? Not obvious what that would be. 
21:23
Some parts are probably not important. Maybe the cerebellum is not important   to cognition, its thoughts, so  maybe we can skip some of it. 
21:29
But I still think there's, for example, the  amygdala, all the emotions and instincts.  There's probably a bunch of other nuclei  in the brain that are very ancient that  
21:36
I don't think we've really replicated. I don't know that we should be pursuing the   building of an analog of a human brain. I'm an engineer mostly at heart. 
21:48
Maybe another way to answer the question is that  you're not going to hire this thing as an intern.  It's missing a lot of it because it comes with  a lot of these cognitive deficits that we all  
21:55
intuitively feel when we talk to the models. So it's not fully there yet.  You can look at it as not all the  brain parts are checked off yet. 
22:04
This is maybe relevant to the question of thinking  about how fast these issues will be solved. 
22:10
Sometimes people will say  about continual learning,   "Look, you could easily replicate this capability. Just as in-context learning emerged spontaneously  
22:19
as a result of pre-training, continual  learning over longer horizons will emerge  
22:24
spontaneously if the model is incentivized to  recollect information over longer horizons,  
22:30
or horizons longer than one session." So if there's some outer loop RL which has  
22:39
many sessions within that outer loop, then this  continual learning where it fine-tunes itself,  
22:46
or it writes to an external memory or  something, will just emerge spontaneously.  Do you think things like that are plausible? I just don't have a prior over  
22:53
how plausible that is. How likely is that to happen?  I don't know that I fully resonate with that. These models, when you boot them up and they have  
22:59
zero tokens in the window, they're always  restarting from scratch where they were.  So I don't know in that  worldview what it looks like. 
23:09
Maybe making some analogies to humans—just because  I think it's roughly concrete and interesting to   think through—I feel like when I'm awake, I'm  building up a context window of stuff that's  
23:17
happening during the day. But when I go to sleep,   something magical happens where I don't  think that context window stays around. 
23:23
There's some process of distillation  into the weights of my brain.  This happens during sleep and all this stuff. We don't have an equivalent  
23:30
of that in large language models. That's to me more adjacent to when you talk   about continual learning and so on as absent. These models don't really have a distillation  
23:40
phase of taking what happened, analyzing it  obsessively, thinking through it, doing some  
23:47
synthetic data generation process and distilling  it back into the weights, and maybe having   a specific neural net per person. Maybe it's  a LoRA. It's not a full-weight neural network. 
24:01
It's just some small sparse subset  of the weights that are changed.  But we do want to create ways of creating  these individuals that have very long context. 
24:10
It's not only remaining in the context window  because the context windows grow very, very long.  Maybe we have some very elaborate,  sparse attention over it. 
24:17
But I still think that humans obviously have some  process for distilling some of that knowledge   into the weights. We're missing it. I do also  think that humans have some very elaborate,  
24:27
sparse attention scheme, which I think  we're starting to see some early hints of. 
24:33
DeepSeek v3.2 just came out and I saw that they  have sparse attention as an example, and this is  
24:38
one way to have very, very long context windows. So I feel like we are redoing a lot of the  
24:44
cognitive tricks that evolution came up  with through a very different process.  But we're going to converge on a  similar architecture cognitively. 
24:51
In 10 years, do you think it'll still be something  like a transformer, but with much more modified   attention and more sparse MLPs and so forth? The way I like to think about it is  
25:00
translation invariance in time. So 10 years ago, where were we? 2015.  In 2015, we had convolutional neural networks  primarily, residual networks just came out. 
25:10
So remarkably similar, I guess, but quite a  bit different still. The transformer was not   around. All these more modern tweaks  on the transformer were not around. 
25:21
Maybe some of the things that we can bet on, I  think in 10 years by translational equivariance,  
25:27
is that we're still training giant neural  networks with a forward backward pass and   update through gradient descent,  but maybe it looks a bit different,  
25:36
and it's just that everything is much bigger. Recently I went back all the way to 1989 which  
25:42
was a fun exercise for me, a few years ago,  because I was reproducing Yann LeCun's 1989  
25:48
convolutional network, which was the first neural  network I'm aware of trained via gradient descent,   like modern neural network trained  gradient descent on digit recognition. 
25:57
I was just interested in  how I could modernize this.  How much of this is algorithms? How much of this is data?  How much of this progress is compute and systems? I was able to very quickly halve the learning  
26:06
just by time traveling by 33 years. So if I time travel by algorithms 33 years,  
26:13
I could adjust what Yann LeCun did  in 1989, and I could halve the error.  But to get further gains, I  had to add a lot more data,  
26:21
I had to 10x the training set, and then I  had to add more computational optimizations.  I had to train for much longer with dropout  and other regularization techniques. 
26:30
So all these things have  to improve simultaneously.  We're probably going to have a lot more  data, we're probably going to have a lot  
26:37
better hardware, probably going to have a lot  better kernels and software, we're probably   going to have better algorithms. All of those, it's almost like  
26:43
no one of them is winning too much. All of them are surprisingly equal. 
26:48
This has been the trend for a while. So to answer your question, I expect differences  
26:54
algorithmically to what's happening today. But I do also expect that some of the   things that have stuck around for a very  long time will probably still be there. 
27:01
It's probably still a giant neural network trained  with gradient descent. That would be my guess.  It's surprising that all of those things  together only halved the error, 30 years  
27:13
of progress…. Maybe half is a lot. Because if  you halve the error, that actually means that…  Half is a lot. But I guess what was shocking to me  is everything needs to improve across the board:  
27:24
architecture, optimizer, loss function. It also has improved across the board forever.  So I expect all those  changes to be alive and well. 
27:31
Yeah. I was about to ask you a very  similar question about nanochat.  Since you just coded it up recently,  every single step in the process of  
27:40
building a chatbot is fresh in your RAM. I'm curious if you had similar thoughts about,  
27:46
"Oh, there was no one thing that was  relevant to going from GPT-2 to nanochat." 
27:52
What are some surprising  takeaways from the experience?  Of building nanochat? So nanochat  is a repository I released. 
27:59
Was it yesterday or the day  before? I can't remember.  We can see the sleep  deprivation that went into the… 
28:09
It's trying to be the simplest complete  repository that covers the whole pipeline   end-to-end of building a ChatGPT clone. So you have all of the steps, not just  
28:18
any individual step, which is a bunch. I worked on all the individual steps   in the past and released small pieces  of code that show you how that's done  
28:25
in an algorithmic sense, in simple code. But this handles the entire pipeline. 
28:32
In terms of learning, I don't  know that I necessarily found   something that I learned from it. I already had in my mind how you build it. 
28:40
This is just the process of mechanically building  it and making it clean enough so that people can  
28:48
learn from it and that they find it useful. What is the best way for somebody   to learn from it? Is it to just delete  
28:54
all the code and try to reimplement from  scratch, try to add modifications to it?  That's a great question. Basically  it's about 8,000 lines of code  
29:03
that takes you through the entire pipeline. I would probably put it on the right monitor.  If you have two monitors, you put it on the right. You want to build it from scratch,  
29:11
you build it from the start. You're not allowed to copy-paste, you're allowed   to reference, you're not allowed to copy-paste. Maybe that's how I would do it. 
29:18
But I also think the repository  by itself is a pretty large beast. 
29:23
When you write this code, you don't go from top  to bottom, you go from chunks and you grow the   chunks, and that information is absent. You wouldn't know where to start. 
29:31
So it's not just a final repository that's  needed, it's the building of the repository,   which is a complicated chunk-growing process. So that part is not there yet. 
29:40
I would love to add that probably later this week. It's probably a video or something like that. 
29:49
Roughly speaking, that's what I would try to do. Build the stuff yourself, but don't allow   yourself copy-paste. I do think that  
29:55
there's two types of knowledge, almost. There's the high-level surface knowledge, but when   you build something from scratch, you're forced to  come to terms with what you don't understand and  
30:04
you don't know that you don't understand it. It always leads to a deeper understanding. 
30:09
It's the only way to build. If I can't build it, I don't understand it.  That’s a Feynman quote, I believe. I 100% have always believed this very  
30:19
strongly, because there are all these micro  things that are just not properly arranged   and you don't really have the knowledge. You just think you have the knowledge. 
30:25
So don't write blog posts, don't  do slides, don't do any of that.  Build the code, arrange it, get it to work. It's the only way to go. Otherwise,  
30:31
you're missing knowledge. You tweeted out that coding models   were of very little help to you in assembling  this repository. I'm curious why that was. 
LLM cognitive deficits
30:43
I guess I built the repository over  a period of a bit more than a month.  I would say there are three major classes  of how people interact with code right now. 
30:50
Some people completely reject all of LLMs  and they are just writing by scratch.  This is probably not the  right thing to do anymore. 
30:58
The intermediate part, which is where I am, is  you still write a lot of things from scratch,   but you use the autocomplete that's  available now from these models. 
31:06
So when you start writing out a little  piece of it, it will autocomplete for   you and you can just tap through. Most of the time it's correct,  
31:12
sometimes it's not, and you edit it. But you're still very much the   architect of what you're writing. Then there's the vibe coding: "Hi,  
31:21
please implement this or that," enter, and then  let the model do it. That's the agents. I do feel  
31:28
like the agents work in very specific settings,  and I would use them in specific settings. 
31:33
But these are all tools available to you  and you have to learn what they're good at,   what they're not good at, and when to use them. So the agents are pretty good, for example,  
31:40
if you're doing boilerplate stuff. Boilerplate code that's just   copy-paste stuff, they're very good at that. They're very good at stuff that occurs very often  
31:48
on the Internet because there are lots of examples  of it in the training sets of these models. 
31:55
There are features of things where  the models will do very well.  I would say nanochat is not an example of  those because it's a fairly unique repository. 
32:03
There's not that much code in the way that  I've structured it. It's not boilerplate code.  
32:08
It's intellectually intense code almost, and  everything has to be very precisely arranged.  The models have so many cognitive deficits. One example, they kept misunderstanding the code  
32:22
because they have too much memory from  all the typical ways of doing things on   the Internet that I just wasn't adopting. The models, for example—I don't know if I  
32:31
want to get into the full details—but they kept  thinking I'm writing normal code, and I'm not. 
32:36
Maybe one example? You have eight GPUs   that are all doing forward, backwards. The way to synchronize gradients between  
32:44
them is to use a Distributed Data Parallel  container of PyTorch, which automatically   as you're doing the backward, it will start  communicating and synchronizing gradients. 
32:52
I didn't use DDP because I didn't want  to use it, because it's not necessary.  I threw it out and wrote my own synchronization  routine that's inside the step of the optimizer. 
33:02
The models were trying to get me to  use the DDP container. They were very   concerned. This gets way too technical,  but I wasn't using that container because  
33:11
I don't need it and I have a custom  implementation of something like it.  They just couldn't internalize  that you had your own. 
33:16
They couldn't get past that. They kept trying to  mess up the style. They're way too over-defensive.  
33:23
They make all these try-catch statements. They keep trying to make a production code base,   and I have a bunch of assumptions  in my code, and it's okay. 
33:31
I don't need all this extra stuff in there. So I feel like they're bloating the code base,   bloating the complexity, they keep  misunderstanding, they're using  
33:38
deprecated APIs a bunch of times. It's a total  mess. It's just not net useful. I can go in,  
33:46
I can clean it up, but it's not net useful. I also feel like it's annoying to have to   type out what I want in English  because it's too much typing. 
33:54
If I just navigate to the part of the code that I  want, and I go where I know the code has to appear   and I start typing out the first few letters,  autocomplete gets it and just gives you the code. 
34:03
This is a very high information  bandwidth to specify what you want.  You point to the code where you want  it, you type out the first few pieces,  
34:10
and the model will complete it. So what I mean is, these models  
34:15
are good in certain parts of the stack. There are two examples where I use the  
34:22
models that I think are illustrative. One was when I generated the report.  That's more boilerplate-y, so I  partially vibe-coded some of that stuff. 
34:30
That was fine because it's not  mission-critical stuff, and it works fine.  The other part is when I was  rewriting the tokenizer in Rust. 
34:37
I'm not as good at Rust  because I'm fairly new to Rust.  So there's a bit of vibe coding going on  when I was writing some of the Rust code. 
34:45
But I had a Python implementation that I  fully understand, and I'm just making sure   I'm making a more efficient version of it, and  I have tests so I feel safer doing that stuff. 
34:56
They increase accessibility to languages or  paradigms that you might not be as familiar with. 
35:02
I think they're very helpful there as well. There's a ton of Rust code out there,   the models are pretty good at it. I happen to not know that much about it,  
35:09
so the models are very useful there. The reason this question is so interesting   is because the main story people  have about AI exploding and getting  
35:19
to superintelligence pretty rapidly is AI  automating AI engineering and AI research. 
35:25
They'll look at the fact that you can have  Claude Code and make entire applications,   CRUD applications, from scratch and think, "If  you had this same capability inside of OpenAI  
35:32
and DeepMind and everything, just imagine  a thousand of you or a million of you in  
35:38
parallel, finding little architectural tweaks." It's quite interesting to hear you say that this  
35:43
is the thing they're asymmetrically worse at. It's quite relevant to forecasting whether   the AI 2027-type explosion is  likely to happen anytime soon. 
35:53
That's a good way of putting it, and you're  getting at why my timelines are a bit longer.   You're right. They're not very good at code  that has never been written before, maybe it's  
36:04
one way to put it, which is what we're trying  to achieve when we're building these models.  Very naive question, but the architectural  tweaks that you're adding to nanochat,  
36:14
they're in a paper somewhere, right? They might even be in a repo somewhere. 
36:20
Is it surprising that they aren't able to  integrate that into whenever you're like,   "Add RoPE embeddings" or something,  they do that in the wrong way? 
36:29
It's tough. They know, but they don't fully know. They don't know how to fully integrate it into   the repo and your style and your code and  your place, and some of the custom things  
36:37
that you're doing and how it fits with  all the assumptions of the repository. 
36:42
They do have some knowledge, but they  haven't gotten to the place where they   can integrate it and make sense of it. A lot of the stuff continues to improve. 
36:54
Currently, the state-of-the-art  model that I go to is the GPT-5 Pro,   and that's a very powerful model. If I have 20 minutes,  
37:01
I will copy-paste my entire repo and I go to  GPT-5 Pro, the oracle, for some questions.  Often it's not too bad and surprisingly  good compared to what existed a year ago. 
37:11
Overall, the models are not there. I feel like the industry is making too  
37:20
big of a jump and is trying to pretend like this  is amazing, and it's not. It's slop. They're not  
37:27
coming to terms with it, and maybe they're  trying to fundraise or something like that.  I'm not sure what's going on, but we're  at this intermediate stage. The models are  
37:33
amazing. They still need a lot of work. For now, autocomplete is my sweet spot.  But sometimes, for some types of  code, I will go to an LLM agent. 
37:43
Here's another reason this is really interesting. Through the history of programming, there have  
37:48
been many productivity improvements—compilers,  linting, better programming languages—which  
37:55
have increased programmer productivity  but have not led to an explosion.  That sounds very much like the  autocomplete tab, and this other  
38:04
category is just automation of the programmer. It's interesting you're seeing more in the   category of the historical analogies  of better compilers or something. 
38:13
Maybe this gets to one other thought. I have a hard time differentiating where  
38:19
AI begins and stops because I see  AI as fundamentally an extension of   computing in a pretty fundamental way. I see a continuum of this recursive  
38:28
self-improvement or speeding up programmers  all the way from the beginning: code editors,  
38:37
syntax highlighting, or checking even of  the types, like data type checking—all  
38:44
these tools that we've built for  each other. Even search engines.   Why aren't search engines part of AI? Ranking  is AI. At some point, Google, even early on,  
38:55
was thinking of themselves as an AI company doing  Google Search engine, which is totally fair.  I see it as a lot more of a continuum than other  people do, and it's hard for me to draw the line. 
39:04
I feel like we're now getting a much  better autocomplete, and now we're also   getting some agents which are these loopy  things, but they go off-rails sometimes. 
39:13
What's going on is that the human is progressively  doing a bit less and less of the low-level stuff.  We're not writing the assembly  code because we have compilers. 
39:20
Compilers will take my high-level  language in C and write the assembly code.  We're abstracting ourselves very, very slowly. There's this what I call "autonomy slider," where  
39:28
more and more stuff is automated—of the stuff that  can be automated at any point in time—and we're   doing a bit less and less and raising ourselves  in the layer of abstraction over the automation. 
RL is terrible
40:53
Let's talk about RL a bit. You tweeted some very   interesting things about this. Conceptually, how should we think about  
41:00
the way that humans are able to build a rich world  model just from interacting with our environment,  
41:07
and in ways that seem almost irrespective of  the final reward at the end of the episode? 
41:13
If somebody is starting a business, and at  the end of 10 years, she finds out whether   the business succeeded or failed, we say that  she's earned a bunch of wisdom and experience. 
41:22
But it's not because the log probs of every  single thing that happened over the last 10   years are up-weighted or down-weighted. Something much more deliberate and  
41:29
rich is happening. What is the ML analogy, and how does that   compare to what we're doing with LLMs right now? Maybe the way I would put it is that humans don't  
41:36
use reinforcement learning, as I said. I think they do something different. 
41:42
Reinforcement learning is a lot worse than I  think the average person thinks. Reinforcement  
41:48
learning is terrible. It just so happens  that everything that we had before it is   much worse because previously we were just  imitating people, so it has all these issues. 
41:59
In reinforcement learning, say you're solving  a math problem, because it's very simple.  You're given a math problem and  you're trying to find the solution. 
42:08
In reinforcement learning, you will  try lots of things in parallel first. 
42:13
You're given a problem, you try hundreds of  different attempts. These attempts can be complex.   They can be like, "Oh, let me try this, let me try  that, this didn't work, that didn't work," etc. 
42:22
Then maybe you get an answer. Now you check the back of the book and you see,   "Okay, the correct answer is this." You can see that this one, this one,  
42:30
and that one got the correct answer,  but these other 97 of them didn't.  Literally what reinforcement learning does is it  goes to the ones that worked really well and every  
42:37
single thing you did along the way, every single  token gets upweighted like, "Do more of this."  The problem with that is people will say  that your estimator has high variance,  
42:46
but it's just noisy. It's noisy. It almost assumes  that every single little piece of the solution  
42:53
that you made that arrived at the right answer  was the correct thing to do, which is not true.  You may have gone down the wrong alleys  until you arrived at the right solution. 
43:00
Every single one of those incorrect things you  did, as long as you got to the correct solution,   will be upweighted as, "Do more of this."  It's terrible. It's noise. You've done all  
43:08
this work only to find, at the end, you get a  single number of like, "Oh, you did correct." 
43:14
Based on that, you weigh that entire  trajectory as like, upweight or downweight.  The way I like to put it is you're  sucking supervision through a straw. 
43:22
You've done all this work that  could be a minute of rollout,   and you're sucking the bits of supervision of the  final reward signal through a straw and you're  
43:33
broadcasting that across the entire trajectory  and using that to upweight or downweight that   trajectory. It's just stupid and  crazy. A human would never do this. 
43:39
Number one, a human would  never do hundreds of rollouts.  Number two, when a person finds a solution,  they will have a pretty complicated process  
43:47
of review of, "Okay, I think these parts I  did well, these parts I did not do that well.  I should probably do this or that."  They think through things. There's  
43:55
nothing in current LLMs that does this.  There's no equivalent of it. But I do see   papers popping out that are trying to do this  because it's obvious to everyone in the field. 
44:05
The first imitation learning, by the way, was  extremely surprising and miraculous and amazing,   that we can fine-tune by imitation on humans.  That was incredible. Because in the beginning,  
44:14
all we had was base models. Base models  are autocomplete. It wasn't obvious to   me at the time, and I had to learn this. The paper that blew my mind was InstructGPT,  
44:24
because it pointed out that you can take  the pretrained model, which is autocomplete,   and if you just fine-tune it on text that looks  like conversations, the model will very rapidly  
44:32
adapt to become very conversational, and it  keeps all the knowledge from pre-training.  This blew my mind because I didn't understand  that stylistically, it can adjust so quickly  
44:41
and become an assistant to a user through just  a few loops of fine-tuning on that kind of data. 
44:46
It was very miraculous to me that that worked.  So incredible. That was two to three years of  
44:51
work. Now came RL. And RL allows you to do a bit  better than just imitation learning because you  
44:58
can have these reward functions and you  can hill-climb on the reward functions.  Some problems have just correct answers, you  can hill-climb on that without getting expert  
45:06
trajectories to imitate. So that's amazing. The  model can also discover solutions that a human   might never come up with. This is incredible.  Yet, it's still stupid. We need more. I saw a  
45:19
paper from Google yesterday that tried to  have this reflect & review idea in mind. 
45:25
Was it the memory bank paper or something? I don't  know. I've seen a few papers along these lines. 
45:30
So I expect there to be some major update to how  we do algorithms for LLMs coming in that realm. 
45:37
I think we need three or four or  five more, something like that. 
45:42
You're so good at coming up with evocative  phrases. "Sucking supervision through a  
45:47
straw." It's so good. You're saying the problem  with outcome-based reward is that you have this  
45:56
huge trajectory, and then at the end, you're  trying to learn every single possible thing  
46:01
about what you should do and what you should  learn about the world from that one final bit. 
46:07
Given the fact that this is obvious, why hasn't  process-based supervision as an alternative been   a successful way to make models more capable? What has been preventing us from using  
46:15
this alternative paradigm? Process-based supervision just   refers to the fact that we're not going to  have a reward function only at the very end. 
46:21
After you've done 10 minutes of work, I'm not  going to tell you you did well or not well.  I'm going to tell you at every single  step of the way how well you're doing. 
46:28
The reason we don't have that is  it's tricky how you do that properly.  You have partial solutions and you  don't know how to assign credit. 
46:34
So when you get the right answer, it's just  an equality match to the answer. It’s very   simple to implement. If you're doing process  supervision, how do you assign in an automatable  
46:44
way, a partial credit assignment? It's not obvious how you do it.  Lots of labs are trying to  do it with these LLM judges. 
46:50
You get LLMs to try to do it. You prompt an LLM, "Hey,   look at a partial solution of a student. How well do you think they're doing if the  
46:56
answer is this?" and they try to tune the prompt. The reason that this is tricky is quite subtle. 
47:02
It's the fact that anytime you use an LLM to  assign a reward, those LLMs are giant things  
47:07
with billions of parameters, and they're gameable. If you're reinforcement learning with respect to   them, you will find adversarial examples  for your LLM judges, almost guaranteed. 
47:15
So you can't do this for too long. You do maybe 10 steps or 20 steps, and maybe   it will work, but you can't do 100 or 1,000. I understand it's not obvious, but basically  
47:25
the model will find little cracks. It will find all these spurious  
47:30
things in the nooks and crannies of the  giant model and find a way to cheat it.  One example that's prominently in my mind, this  was probably public, if you're using an LLM judge  
47:42
for a reward, you just give it a solution from a  student and ask it if the student did well or not.  We were training with  reinforcement learning against  
47:49
that reward function, and it worked really well. Then, suddenly, the reward became extremely large. 
47:55
It was a massive jump, and it did perfect. You're looking at it like, "Wow, this means   the student is perfect in all these problems.  It's fully solved math." But when you look at  
48:05
the completions that you're getting from  the model, they are complete nonsense.  They start out okay, and then  they change to "dhdhdhdh." 
48:11
It's just like, "Oh, okay, let's take two plus  three and we do this and this, and then dhdhdhdh."  You're looking at it, and  it's like, this is crazy. 
48:17
How is it getting a reward of one or 100%? You look at the LLM judge, and it turns out   that "dhdhdhdh" is an adversarial example for  the model, and it assigns 100% probability to it. 
48:27
It's just because this is an  out-of-sample example to the LLM.  It's never seen it during training,  and you're in pure generalization land. 
48:34
It's never seen it during training, and in  the pure generalization land, you can find   these examples that break it. You're basically training  
48:42
the LLM to be a prompt injection model. Not even that. Prompt injection is way too fancy.  You're finding adversarial  examples, as they're called. 
48:48
These are nonsensical solutions that are obviously  wrong, but the model thinks they are amazing. 
48:55
To the extent you think this is the  bottleneck to making RL more functional,   then that will require making LLMs better judges,  if you want to do this in an automated way. 
49:05
Is it just going to be some sort  of GAN-like approach where you   have to train models to be more robust? The labs are probably doing all that. 
49:11
The obvious thing is, "dhdhdhdh"  should not get 100% reward.  Okay, well, take "dhdhdhdh," put it  in the training set of the LLM judge,  
49:17
and say this is not 100%, this is 0%. You can do this, but every time you do   this, you get a new LLM, and it  still has adversarial examples. 
49:24
There's an infinity of adversarial examples. Probably if you iterate this a few times, it'll   probably be harder and harder to find adversarial  examples, but I'm not 100% sure because this thing  
49:32
has a trillion parameters or whatnot. I bet you the labs are trying. 
49:41
I still think we need other ideas. Interesting. Do you have some shape   of what the other idea could be? This idea of a review solution  
49:54
encompassing synthetic examples such that  when you train on them, you get better,   and meta-learn it in some way. I think there are some papers  
50:00
that I'm starting to see pop out. I am only at a stage of reading abstracts   because a lot of these papers are just ideas. Someone has to make it work on a frontier  
50:08
LLM lab scale in full generality  because when you see these papers,   they pop up, and it's just a bit noisy. They're cool ideas, but I haven't seen  
50:17
anyone convincingly show that this is possible. That said, the LLM labs are fairly closed,  
50:23
so who knows what they're doing now. I can conceptualize how you would be able  
How do humans learn?
50:33
to train on synthetic examples or synthetic  problems that you have made for yourself.  But there seems to be another thing humans  do—maybe sleep is this, maybe daydreaming is  
50:40
this—which is not necessarily to come up  with fake problems, but just to reflect. 
50:47
I'm not sure what the ML analogy is for  daydreaming or sleeping, or just reflecting.  I haven't come up with a new problem. Obviously, the very basic analogy would just  
50:54
be fine-tuning on reflection bits, but I feel like  in practice that probably wouldn't work that well. 
51:00
Do you have some take on what  the analogy of this thing is?  I do think that we're missing some aspects there. As an example, let’s take reading a book. 
51:11
Currently when LLMs are reading a book, what that  means is we stretch out the sequence of text,   and the model is predicting the next token,  and it's getting some knowledge from that. 
51:19
That's not really what humans do. When you're reading a book,   I don't even feel like the book is exposition  I'm supposed to be attending to and training on. 
51:25
The book is a set of prompts for  me to do synthetic data generation,   or for you to get to a book club  and talk about it with your friends. 
51:33
It's by manipulating that information  that you actually gain that knowledge.  We have no equivalent of that with LLMs. They  don't really do that. I'd love to see during  
51:42
pre-training some stage that thinks through  the material and tries to reconcile it with   what it already knows, and thinks through it  for some amount of time and gets that to work. 
51:52
There's no equivalence of any of this.  This is all research. There are some   subtle—very subtle that I think are very hard  to understand—reasons why it's not trivial. 
51:59
If I can just describe one: why can't we  just synthetically generate and train on it?  Because every synthetic example, if  I just give synthetic generation of  
52:07
the model thinking about a book, you look  at it and you're like, "This looks great.  Why can't I train on it?" You could try, but the model  
52:12
will get much worse if you continue trying. That's because all of the samples you get   from models are silently collapsed. Silently—it is not obvious if you look  
52:21
at any individual example of it—they occupy  a very tiny manifold of the possible space of  
52:27
thoughts about content. The LLMs, when they come off,   they're what we call "collapsed." They have a collapsed data distribution. 
52:34
One easy way to see it is to go to  ChatGPT and ask it, "Tell me a joke."  It only has like three jokes. It's not giving you the whole breadth  
52:41
of possible jokes. It knows like three jokes.  They're silently collapsed. You're not getting  
52:47
the richness and the diversity and the entropy  from these models as you would get from humans. 
52:52
Humans are a lot noisier, but  at least they're not biased,   in a statistical sense. They're not silently  collapsed. They maintain a huge amount of entropy. 
53:00
So how do you get synthetic data generation to  work despite the collapse and while maintaining   the entropy? That’s a research problem. Just to make sure I understood, the reason  
53:09
that the collapse is relevant to synthetic data  generation is because you want to be able to   come up with synthetic problems or reflections  which are not already in your data distribution? 
53:20
I guess what I'm saying is, say we have a chapter  of a book and I ask an LLM to think about it,  
53:26
it will give you something  that looks very reasonable.  But if I ask it 10 times, you'll  notice that all of them are the same. 
53:31
You can't just keep scaling "reflection"  on the same amount of prompt information  
53:39
and then get returns from that. Any individual sample will look okay,   but the distribution of it is quite terrible. It's quite terrible in such a way that if  
53:47
you continue training on too much of  your own stuff, you actually collapse.  I think that there's possibly  no fundamental solution to this. 
53:54
I also think humans collapse over time.  These analogies are surprisingly good.  
54:00
Humans collapse during the course of their lives. This is why children, they haven't overfit yet. 
54:06
They will say stuff that will shock you  because you can see where they're coming from,   but it's just not the thing people say,  because they're not yet collapsed. But we're  
54:14
collapsed. We end up revisiting the same thoughts. We end up saying more and more of the same stuff,  
54:20
and the learning rates go down, and  the collapse continues to get worse,   and then everything deteriorates. Have you seen this super interesting  
54:28
paper that dreaming is a way of preventing  this kind of overfitting and collapse? 
54:34
The reason dreaming is evolutionary adaptive  is to put you in weird situations that are  
54:41
very unlike your day-to-day reality, so  as to prevent this kind of overfitting.  It's an interesting idea. I do think  that when you're generating things  
54:48
in your head and then you're attending to  it, you're training on your own samples,   you're training on your synthetic data. If you do it for too long,  
54:53
you go off-rails and you collapse way too much. You always have to seek entropy in your life. 
55:01
Talking to other people is a great  source of entropy, and things like that.  So maybe the brain has also built some internal  mechanisms for increasing the amount of entropy  
55:11
in that process. That's an interesting idea. This is a very ill-formed thought so I’ll  
55:16
just put it out and let you react to it. The best learners that we are aware of,   which are children, are extremely  bad at recollecting information. 
55:25
In fact, at the very earliest stages of  childhood, you will forget everything.  You're just an amnesiac about everything  that happens before a certain year date. 
55:32
But you're extremely good at picking up  new languages and learning from the world.  Maybe there's some element of being  able to see the forest for the trees. 
55:38
Whereas if you compare it to the opposite end  of the spectrum, you have LLM pre-training,  
55:44
where these models will literally be  able to regurgitate word-for-word what   is the next thing in a Wikipedia page. But their ability to learn abstract  
55:52
concepts really quickly, the way  a child can, is much more limited.  Then adults are somewhere in between, where  they don't have the flexibility of childhood  
55:59
learning, but they can memorize facts and  information in a way that is harder for kids. 
56:05
I don't know if there's something  interesting about that spectrum.  I think there's something very  interesting about that, 100%.  I do think that humans have a lot more of  an element, compared to LLMs, of seeing  
56:16
the forest for the trees. We're not actually that good   at memorization, which is actually a feature. Because we're not that good at memorization, we're  
56:25
forced to find patterns in a more general sense. LLMs in comparison are extremely good  
56:33
at memorization. They will recite   passages from all these training sources. You can give them completely nonsensical data. 
56:41
You can hash some amount of text or something  like that, you get a completely random sequence.  If you train on it, even just for a single  iteration or two, it can suddenly regurgitate  
56:48
the entire thing. It will memorize it.  There's no way a person can read a single   sequence of random numbers and recite it to you. That's a feature, not a bug, because it forces  
56:58
you to only learn the generalizable components. Whereas LLMs are distracted by all the memory   that they have of the pre-training  documents, and it's probably very  
57:06
distracting to them in a certain sense. So that's why when I talk about the   cognitive core, I want to remove the  memory, which is what we talked about. 
57:13
I'd love to have them have less memory  so that they have to look things up,   and they only maintain the algorithms for  thought, and the idea of an experiment,  
57:22
and all this cognitive glue of acting. And this is also relevant to preventing  
57:28
model collapse? Let me think. I'm  
57:35
not sure. It's almost like a separate axis. The models are way too good at memorization,  
57:40
and somehow we should remove that. People are much worse, but it's a good thing. 
57:46
What is a solution to model collapse? There are very naive things you could attempt. 
57:52
The distribution over logits  should be wider or something.  There are many naive things you could try. What ends up being the problem  
57:58
with the naive approaches? That's a great question. You can imagine having   a regularization for entropy and things like that. I guess they just don't work as well empirically  
58:06
because right now the models are collapsed. But I will say most of the tasks that we  
58:13
want from them don't actually demand diversity. That’s probably the answer to what's going on. 
58:20
The frontier labs are trying  to make the models useful.  I feel like the diversity of  the outputs is not so much... 
58:26
Number one, it's much harder to work with and  evaluate and all this stuff, but maybe it's not   what's capturing most of the value. In fact, it's actively penalized.  
58:34
If you're super creative in RL, it's not good. Yeah. Or maybe if you're doing a lot of writing,  
58:39
help from LLMs and stuff like that, it's probably  bad because the models will silently give   you all the same stuff. They won't explore lots  
58:48
of different ways of answering a question. Maybe this diversity, not as many applications  
58:56
need it so the models don't have it. But then it's a problem at   synthetic data generation time, et cetera. So we're shooting ourselves in the foot by not  
59:01
allowing this entropy to maintain in the model. Possibly the labs should try harder. 
59:06
I think you hinted that it's a very  fundamental problem, it won't be easy   to solve. What's your intuition for that? I don't know if it's super fundamental. 
59:17
I don't know if I intended to say that. I do think that I haven't done these experiments,  
59:23
but I do think that you could probably  regularize the entropy to be higher.  So you're encouraging the model to give you more  and more solutions, but you don't want it to  
59:31
start deviating too much from the training data. It's going to start making up its own language.  It's going to start using words that are  extremely rare, so it's going to drift too  
59:38
much from the distribution. So I think controlling   the distribution is just tricky. It's probably not trivial in that sense. 
59:47
How many bits should the optimal core  of intelligence end up being if you  
59:54
just had to make a guess? The thing we put on the   von Neumann probes, how big does it have to be? It's really interesting in the history of the  
1:00:01
field because at one point everything was  very scaling-pilled in terms of like, "Oh,   we're gonna make much bigger models,  trillions of parameter models." 
1:00:08
What the models have done in size  is they've gone up and now they've  
1:00:14
come down. State-of-the-art models are smaller.  Even then, I think they memorized way too much. 
1:00:20
So I had a prediction a while back that I almost  feel like we can get cognitive cores that are   very good at even a billion parameters. If you talk to a billion parameter model,  
1:00:30
I think in 20 years, you can have  a very productive conversation.  It thinks and it's a lot more like a human. But if you ask it some factual question, it might  
1:00:39
have to look it up, but it knows that it doesn't  know and it might have to look it up and it will   just do all the reasonable things. That's surprising that you think  
1:00:44
it'll take a billion parameters. Because already we have billion   parameter models or a couple billion  parameter models that are very intelligent. 
1:00:51
Well, state-of-the-art models  are like a trillion parameters.  But they remember so much stuff. Yeah, but I'm surprised that in 10 years,  
1:00:58
given the pace… We have gpt-oss-20b. That's way better than GPT-4 original,  
1:01:07
which was a trillion plus parameters. Given that trend, I'm surprised you   think in 10 years the cognitive  core is still a billion parameters. 
1:01:15
I'm surprised you're not like, "Oh it's  gonna be like tens of millions or millions." 
1:01:22
Here's the issue, the training data is  the internet, which is really terrible.  There's a huge amount of gains to be  made because the internet is terrible. 
1:01:29
Even the internet, when you and I think of  the internet, you're thinking of like The   Wall Street Journal. That's not what this  is. When you're looking at a pre-training  
1:01:36
dataset in the frontier lab and you look at a  random internet document, it's total garbage.  I don't even know how this works at all. It's some like stock tickers, symbols,  
1:01:46
it's a huge amount of slop and garbage  from like all the corners of the internet.  It's not like your Wall Street Journal  article, that's extremely rare. 
1:01:53
So because the internet is so terrible, we have  to build really big models to compress all that. 
1:02:00
Most of that compression is memory  work instead of cognitive work.  But what we really want is the  cognitive part, delete the memory. 
1:02:08
I guess what I'm saying is that we need  intelligent models to help us refine even   the pre-training set to just narrow  it down to the cognitive components. 
1:02:15
Then I think you get away with a  much smaller model because it's a   much better dataset and you could train it on it. But probably it's not trained directly on it, it's  
1:02:22
probably distilled from a much better model still. But why is the distilled version still a billion? 
1:02:28
I just feel like distillation  works extremely well.  So almost every small model, if you have a  small model, it's almost certainly distilled. 
1:02:35
Right, but why is the distillation in  10 years not getting below 1 billion?  Oh, you think it should be smaller than a  billion? I mean, come on, right? I don't  
1:02:43
know. At some point it should take at least  a billion knobs to do something interesting. 
1:02:49
You're thinking it should be even smaller? Yeah. If you look at the trend over the last   few years of just finding low-hanging fruit and  going from trillion plus models to models that  
1:02:57
are literally two orders of magnitude smaller in a  matter of two years and having better performance,  
1:03:03
it makes me think the sort of core of  intelligence might be even way, way smaller. 
1:03:09
Plenty of room at the bottom,  to paraphrase Feynman.  I feel like I'm already contrarian  by talking about a billion parameter  
1:03:14
cognitive core and you're outdoing me. Maybe we could get a little bit smaller. 
1:03:23
I do think that practically speaking, you  want the model to have some knowledge.  You don't want it to be looking up everything  because then you can't think in your head. 
1:03:30
You're looking up way too much stuff all the time.  Some basic curriculum needs to be there for  knowledge, but it doesn't have esoteric knowledge. 
1:03:38
We're discussing what plausibly  could be the cognitive core.  There's a separate question which is what  will be the size of frontier models over time? 
1:03:46
I'm curious if you have predictions. We had increasing scale up to maybe GPT 4.5 and   now we're seeing decreasing or plateauing scale. There are many reasons this could be going on. 
1:03:56
Do you have a prediction going forward? Will the biggest models be bigger,   will they be smaller, will they be the same? I don't have a super strong prediction. 
1:04:07
The labs are just being practical. They have a flops budget and a cost budget.  It just turns out that pre-training is not where  you want to put most of your flops or your cost. 
1:04:14
That's why the models have gotten smaller. They are a bit smaller, the pre-training   stage is smaller, but they make  it up in reinforcement learning,  
1:04:21
mid-training, and all this stuff that follows. They're just being practical in terms of all the   stages and how you get the most bang for the buck. Forecasting that trend is quite hard. 
1:04:30
I do still expect that there's so much  low-hanging fruit. That's my basic expectation.  
1:04:38
I have a very wide distribution here. Do you expect the low-hanging fruit to be   similar in kind to the kinds of things that have  been happening over the last two to five years? 
1:04:49
If I look at nanochat versus nanoGPT  and the architectural tweaks you made,   is that the flavor of things you  expect to continue to keep happening? 
1:04:58
You're not expecting any giant paradigm shifts. For the most part, yeah. I expect the   datasets to get much, much better. When you look at the average datasets,  
1:05:03
they're extremely terrible. They’re so bad that I   don't even know how anything works. Look at the average example in the training set:  
1:05:10
factual mistakes, errors, nonsensical things. Somehow when you do it at scale,  
1:05:16
the noise washes away and you're left with  some of the signal. Datasets will improve   a ton. Everything gets better. Our hardware,  all the kernels for running the hardware and  
1:05:29
maximizing what you get with the hardware. Nvidia is slowly tuning the hardware itself,   Tensor Cores, all that needs to  happen and will continue to happen. 
1:05:36
All the kernels will get better and  utilize the chip to the max extent.  All the algorithms will probably improve over  optimization, architecture, and all the modeling  
1:05:45
components of how everything is done and what  the algorithms are that we're even training with.  I do expect that nothing dominates. Everything  plus 20%. This is roughly what I've seen. 
AGI will blend into 2% GDP growth
1:07:13
People have proposed different ways of charting  how much progress we've made towards full AGI. 
1:07:21
If you can come up with some line, then you  can see where that line intersects with AGI   and where that would happen on the x-axis. People have proposed it's the education level. 
1:07:29
We had a high schooler, and then they went to  college with RL, and they're going to get a Ph.D.  I don't like that one. Or they'll propose horizon  
1:07:36
length. Maybe they can do tasks that take  a minute, they can do those autonomously.  Then they can autonomously do tasks that take  an hour, a human an hour, a human a week. 
1:07:46
How do you think about the relevant y-axis here? How should we think about how  
1:07:53
AI is making progress? I have two answers to that.  Number one, I'm almost tempted to  reject the question entirely because  
1:07:59
I see this as an extension of computing. Have we talked about how to chart progress   in computing, or how do you chart progress  in computing since the 1970s or whatever?  
1:08:06
What is the y-axis? The whole question is  funny from that perspective a little bit. 
1:08:13
When people talk about AI and the original AGI  and how we spoke about it when OpenAI started,  
1:08:18
AGI was a system you could go to that can do any  economically valuable task at human performance  
1:08:27
or better. That was the definition. I  was pretty happy with that at the time.  I've stuck to that definition forever, and  then people have made up all kinds of other  
1:08:36
definitions. But I like that definition. The first  concession that people make all the time is they  
1:08:43
just take out all the physical stuff because  we're just talking about digital knowledge work.  That's a pretty major concession compared to  the original definition, which was any task  
1:08:52
a human can do. I can lift things, etc. AI  can't do that, obviously, but we'll take it. 
1:08:57
What fraction of the economy are we taking away  by saying, "Oh, only knowledge work?" I don't know  
1:09:02
the numbers. I feel about 10% to 20%, if I had to  guess, is only knowledge work, someone could work  
1:09:09
from home and perform tasks, something like that. It's still a really large market. 
1:09:16
What is the size of the  economy, and what is 10% or 20%?  We're still talking about a few trillion  dollars, even in the US, of market share or work. 
1:09:26
So it's still a very massive bucket. Going back to the definition,   what I would be looking for is to  what extent is that definition true? 
1:09:35
Are there jobs or lots of tasks? If we think of tasks as not jobs but tasks. 
1:09:40
It's difficult because the problem is society will  refactor based on the tasks that make up jobs,  
1:09:47
based on what's automatable or not. Today, what jobs are replaceable by AI?  A good example recently was Geoff Hinton's  prediction that radiologists would not be  
1:09:57
a job anymore, and this turned out  to be very wrong in a bunch of ways.  Radiologists are alive and well and growing,  even though computer vision is really,  
1:10:04
really good at recognizing all the different  things that they have to recognize in images.  It's just a messy, complicated job with a  lot of surfaces and dealing with patients  
1:10:11
and all this stuff in the context of it. I don't know that by that definition  
1:10:17
AI has made a huge dent yet. Some of the jobs that I would  
1:10:22
be looking for have some features that make it  very amenable to automation earlier than later.  As an example, call center employees  often come up, and I think rightly so. 
1:10:30
Call center employees have a number of simplifying  properties with respect to what's automatable   today. Their jobs are pretty simple. It's a  sequence of tasks, and every task looks similar. 
1:10:42
You take a phone call with a person, it's  10 minutes of interaction or whatever it is,   probably a bit longer. In my experience, a lot longer. 
1:10:49
You complete some task in some scheme,  and you change some database entries   around or something like that. So you keep repeating something  
1:10:55
over and over again, and that's your job. You do want to bring in the task horizon—how  
1:11:01
long it takes to perform a task—and  then you want to also remove context.  You're not dealing with different parts of  services of companies or other customers. 
1:11:08
It's just the database, you,  and a person you're serving.  It's more closed, it's more  understandable, it's purely digital. 
1:11:15
So I would be looking for those things. But even there, I'm not looking   at full automation yet. I'm looking for an autonomy slider. 
1:11:21
I expect that we are not going  to instantly replace people.  We're going to be swapping in  AIs that do 80% of the volume. 
1:11:29
They delegate 20% of the volume to humans,  and humans are supervising teams of five AIs   doing the call center work that's more rote. I would be looking for new interfaces or new  
1:11:39
companies that provide some  layer that allows you to manage   some of these AIs that are not yet perfect. Then I would expect that across the economy. 
1:11:48
A lot of jobs are a lot harder  than a call center employee.  With radiologists, I'm totally  speculating and I have no idea what  
1:11:56
the actual workflow of a radiologist involves. But one analogy that might be applicable is when  
1:12:03
Waymos were first being rolled out, there'd be a  person sitting in the front seat, and you just had  
1:12:09
to have them there to make sure that if something  went really wrong, they're there to monitor.  Even today, people are still watching  to make sure things are going well. 
1:12:15
Robotaxi, which was just deployed,  still has a person inside it.  Now we could be in a similar situation where  if you automate 99% of a job, that last 1%  
1:12:25
the human has to do is incredibly valuable  because it's bottlenecking everything else.  If it were the case with radiologists, where  the person sitting in the front of Waymo has  
1:12:35
to be specially trained for years in order  to provide the last 1%, their wages should   go up tremendously because they're the  one thing bottlenecking wide deployment. 
1:12:43
Radiologists, I think their wages have  gone up for similar reasons, if you're   the last bottleneck and you're not fungible. A Waymo driver might be fungible with others. 
1:12:53
So you might see this thing where your wages  go up until you get to 99% and then fall just   like that when the last 1% is gone. And I wonder if we're seeing similar  
1:13:02
things with radiology or salaries of call  center workers or anything like that.  That's an interesting question. I don't think  we're currently seeing that with radiology. 
1:13:15
I think radiology is not a good example. I don't know why Geoff Hinton picked   on radiology because I think it's an  extremely messy, complicated profession. 
1:13:25
I would be a lot more interested in what's  happening with call center employees today,   for example, because I would expect a lot  of the rote stuff to be automatable today. 
1:13:32
I don't have first-level access to it but  I would be looking for trends of what's   happening with the call center employees. Some of the things I would also expect  
1:13:40
is that maybe they are swapping in AI, but  then I would still wait for a year or two   because I would potentially expect them to  pull back and rehire some of the people. 
1:13:49
There's been evidence that that's already been  happening generally in companies that have been   adopting AI, which I think is quite surprising. I also found what was really surprising. AGI,  
1:13:59
right? A thing which would do everything. We'll take out physical work,   but it should be able to do all knowledge work. What you would have naively anticipated is that  
1:14:09
the way this progression would happen is  that you take a little task that a consultant  
1:14:14
is doing, you take that out of the bucket. You take a little task that an accountant is  
1:14:19
doing, you take that out of the bucket. Then you're just doing this   across all knowledge work. But instead, if we do believe we're  
1:14:25
on the path of AGI with the current paradigm,  the progression is very much not like that. 
1:14:30
It does not seem like consultants and accountants  are getting huge productivity improvements.  It's very much like programmers are getting  more and more chiseled away at their work. 
1:14:39
If you look at the revenues of these companies,  discounting normal chat revenue—which is similar  
1:14:46
to Google or something—just looking at  API revenues, it's dominated by coding.  So this thing which is "general", which  should be able to do any knowledge work,  
1:14:56
is just overwhelmingly doing only coding. It's a surprising way that you would   expect the AGI to be deployed. There's an interesting point  
1:15:04
here. I do believe coding is the perfect  first thing for these LLMs and agents. 
1:15:12
That’s because coding has always  fundamentally worked around text.  It's computer terminals and text,  and everything is based around text. 
1:15:20
LLMs, the way they're trained  on the Internet, love text.  They're perfect text processors, and there's  all this data out there. It's a perfect fit.  
1:15:29
We also have a lot of infrastructure  pre-built for handling code and text.  For example, we have Visual Studio Code  or your favorite IDE showing you code,  
1:15:41
and an agent can plug into that. If an agent has a diff where it made some change,   we suddenly have all this code already that shows  all the differences to a code base using a diff. 
1:15:51
It's almost like we've pre-built a  lot of the infrastructure for code.  Contrast that with some of the  things that don't enjoy that at all. 
1:15:58
As an example, there are people trying to build  automation not for coding, but for slides.  I saw a company doing slides. That's  much, much harder. The reason it's  
1:16:07
much harder is because slides are not text. Slides are little graphics, they're arranged   spatially, and there's a visual component to it. Slides don't have this pre-built infrastructure. 
1:16:18
For example, if an agent is to make a change to  your slides, how does a thing show you the diff? 
1:16:24
How do you see the diff? There's nothing that shows diffs   for slides. Someone has to build it. Some of these  things are not amenable to AIs as they are, which  
1:16:34
are text processors, and code surprisingly is. I’m not sure that alone explains it. 
1:16:42
I personally have tried to get LLMs to be useful  in domains which are just pure language-in,  
1:16:49
language-out, like rewriting transcripts,  coming up with clips based on transcripts. 
1:16:57
It's very plausible that I didn't do  every single possible thing I could do.  I put a bunch of good examples in context, but  maybe I should have done some kind of fine-tuning. 
1:17:06
Our mutual friend, Andy Matuschak, told me that  he tried 50 billion things to try to get models  
1:17:13
to be good at writing spaced repetition prompts. Again, very much language-in, language-out tasks,  
1:17:19
the kind of thing that should be dead  center in the repertoire of these LLMs.  He tried in-context learning  with a few-shot examples. 
1:17:25
He tried supervised fine-tuning and retrieval. He could not get them to make  
1:17:35
cards to his satisfaction. So I find it striking that even in language-out   domains, it's very hard to get a lot of economic  value out of these models separate from coding. 
1:17:45
I don't know what explains it. That makes sense. I'm not  
1:17:52
saying that anything text is trivial. I do think that code is pretty structured. 
1:17:58
Text is maybe a lot more flowery, and there's  a lot more entropy in text, I would say. 
1:18:04
I don't know how else to put it. Also code is hard, and so people feel quite  
1:18:10
empowered by LLMs, even from simple knowledge. I don't know that I have a very good answer. 
1:18:19
Obviously, text makes it much, much easier,  but it doesn't mean that all text is trivial. 
ASI
1:18:25
How do you think about superintelligence? Do you expect it to feel qualitatively different   from normal humans or human companies? I see it as a progression  
1:18:37
of automation in society. Extrapolating the trend of computing, there will  
1:18:42
be a gradual automation of a lot of things, and  superintelligence will an extrapolation of that. 
1:18:47
We expect more and more autonomous  entities over time that are doing a lot   of the digital work and then eventually even  the physical work some amount of time later. 
1:18:56
Basically I see it as just  automation, roughly speaking.  But automation includes the things humans  can already do, and superintelligence  
1:19:03
implies things humans can’t do. But one of the things that people   do is invent new things, which I would just  put into the automation if that makes sense. 
1:19:10
But I guess, less abstractly and more  qualitatively, do you expect something  
1:19:18
to feel like… Because this thing can either think  so fast, or has so many copies, or the copies can  
1:19:26
merge back into themselves, or is much smarter,  any number of advantages an AI might have, will  
1:19:36
the civilization in which these AIs exist just feel qualitatively different from humans?  I think it will. It is fundamentally automation,  but it will be extremely foreign. It will look  
1:19:44
really strange. Like you mentioned, we can run  all of this on a computer cluster and much faster. 
1:19:53
Some of the scenarios that I start to get  nervous about when the world looks like  
1:19:58
that is this gradual loss of control  and understanding of what's happening.  I think that's the most likely outcome, that  there will be a gradual loss of understanding. 
1:20:07
We'll gradually layer all this stuff  everywhere, and there will be fewer   and fewer people who understand it. Then there will be a gradual loss of  
1:20:14
control and understanding of what's happening. That to me seems the most likely outcome of how   all this stuff will go down. Let me probe on that a bit. 
1:20:22
It's not clear to me that loss of control and  loss of understanding are the same things. 
1:20:27
A board of directors at TSMC, Intel—name a random  company—they're just prestigious 80-year-olds. 
1:20:37
They have very little understanding, and maybe  they don't practically actually have control. 
1:20:43
A better example   is the President of the United States. The President has a lot of fucking power. 
1:20:48
I'm not trying to make a good statement  about the current operant, or maybe I am,   but the actual level of understanding is  very different from the level of control. 
1:20:56
I think that's fair. That's a good  pushback. I think I expect loss of both. 
1:21:05
How come? Loss of understanding is  obvious, but why loss of control?  We're really far into a territory where I  don't know what this looks like, but if I  
1:21:14
were to write sci-fi novels, they would look along  the lines of not even a single entity that takes  
1:21:22
over everything, but multiple competing entities  that gradually become more and more autonomous. 
1:21:27
Some of them go rogue and  the others fight them off.  It's this hot pot of completely autonomous  activity that we've delegated to. 
1:21:37
I feel it would have that flavor. It is not the fact that they are smarter  
1:21:43
than us that is resulting in the loss of control. It's the fact that they are competing with each   other, and whatever arises out of that  competition leads to the loss of control. 
1:21:58
A lot of these things, they will be  tools to people, they're acting on  
1:22:04
behalf of people or something like that. So maybe those people are in control,   but maybe it's a loss of control overall for  society in the sense of outcomes we want. 
1:22:13
You have entities acting on behalf of individuals  that are still roughly seen as out of control. 
1:22:20
This is a question I should have asked earlier. We were talking about how currently it feels like   when you're doing AI engineering or AI research,  these models are more in the category of compiler  
1:22:29
rather than in the category of a replacement. At some point, if you have AGI,  
1:22:34
it should be able to do what you do. Do you feel like having a million   copies of you in parallel results in  some huge speed-up of AI progress? 
1:22:43
If that does happen, do you expect to see an  intelligence explosion once we have a true AGI? 
1:22:49
I'm not talking about LLMs today. I do, but it's business as usual because  
1:22:56
we're in an intelligence explosion  already and have been for decades.  It's basically the GDP curve that is  an exponential weighted sum over so  
1:23:03
many aspects of the industry. Everything is gradually being   automated and has been for hundreds of years. The Industrial Revolution is automation and  
1:23:10
some of the physical components and  tool building and all this stuff.  Compilers are early software  automation, et cetera. 
1:23:16
We've been recursively self-improving  and exploding for a long time. 
1:23:21
Another way to see it is that Earth was a pretty  boring place if you don't look at the biomechanics  
1:23:27
and so on, and looked very similar. If you look from space, we're in the  
1:23:33
middle of this firecracker event,  but we're seeing it in slow motion.  I definitely feel like this has  already happened for a very long time. 
1:23:42
Again, I don't see AI as a distinct  technology with respect to what has   already been happening for a long time. You think it's continuous with this  
1:23:50
hyper-exponential trend? Yes. That's why this was   very interesting to me, because I was  trying to find AI in the GDP for a while. 
1:23:57
I thought that GDP should go up. But then I looked at some of the   other technologies that I thought  were very transformative, like  
1:24:04
computers or mobile phones or et cetera. You can't find them in GDP. GDP is the same   exponential. Even the early iPhone didn't have the  App Store, and it didn't have a lot of the bells  
1:24:13
and whistles that the modern iPhone has. So even though we think of 2008,   when the iPhone came out, as this major  seismic change, it's actually not. 
1:24:21
Everything is so spread out and it so  slowly diffuses that everything ends up   being averaged up into the same exponential. It's the exact same thing with computers. 
1:24:28
You can't find them in the GDP  like, "Oh, we have computers now."  That's not what happened, because  it's such slow progression. 
1:24:33
With AI we're going to see the exact same thing.  It's just more automation. It allows us to write   different kinds of programs that we couldn't write  before, but AI is still fundamentally a program. 
1:24:42
It's a new kind of computer and  a new kind of computing system.  But it has all these problems,  it's going to diffuse over time,  
1:24:49
and it's still going to add  up to the same exponential.  We're still going to have an exponential  that's going to get extremely vertical. 
1:24:56
It's going to be very foreign to  live in that kind of an environment.  Are you saying that, if you look at the trend  before the Industrial Revolution to now,  
1:25:05
you have a hyper-exponential where you go  from 0% growth to then 10,000 years ago,  
1:25:11
0.02% growth, and to now when we're at 2%  growth. That's a hyper-exponential. Are you   saying if you're charting AI on there, then  AI takes you to 20% growth or 200% growth? 
1:25:20
Or are you saying that if you look at  the last 300 years, what you've been   seeing is that you have technology after  technology—computers, electrification,  
1:25:27
steam engines, railways, et cetera—but the  rate of growth is the exact same, it's 2%. 
1:25:33
Are you saying the rate of growth will go up? The rate of growth has also stayed  
1:25:38
roughly constant, right? Only over the last 200, 300 years.  But over the course of  human history it's exploded. 
1:25:44
It's gone from 0% to faster, faster,  faster. Industrial explosion, 2%. 
1:25:51
For a while I tried to find AI  or look for AI in the GDP curve,   and I've convinced myself that this is false. Even when people talk about recursive  
1:25:58
self-improvement and labs and stuff  like that, this is business as usual.  Of course it's going to recursively self-improve,  and it's been recursively self-improving. 
1:26:05
LLMs allow the engineers to work much more  efficiently to build the next round of LLM,  
1:26:11
and a lot more of the components are  being automated and tuned and et cetera.  All the engineers having access  to Google Search is part of it. 
1:26:19
All the engineers having an IDE, all of them  having autocomplete or having Claude code,   et cetera, it's all just part of the same  speed-up of the whole thing. It's just so smooth. 
1:26:30
Just to clarify, you're saying that  the rate of growth will not change.  The intelligence explosion will show up as  it just enabled us to continue staying on the  
1:26:39
2% growth trajectory, just as the Internet  helped us stay on the 2% growth trajectory.  Yes, my expectation is that  it stays in the same pattern. 
1:26:47
Just to throw the opposite argument against you,  my expectation is that it blows up because I think  
1:26:55
true AGI—and I'm not talking about LLM coding  bots, I'm talking about actual replacement of a  
1:27:00
human in a server—is qualitatively different  from these other productivity-improving  
1:27:07
technologies because it's labor itself. I think we live in a very labor-constrained world. 
1:27:13
If you talk to any startup founder or any person,  you can be like, what do you need more of? You   need really talented people. And if you have  billions of extra people who are inventing stuff,  
1:27:22
integrating themselves, making companies bottom  start to finish, that feels qualitatively  
1:27:28
different from a single technology. It's as if you get 10 billion   extra people on the planet. Maybe a counterpoint. I'm pretty willing  
1:27:37
to be convinced one way or another on this point. But I will say, for example, computing is labor.   Computing was labor. Computers, a lot  of jobs disappeared because computers  
1:27:45
are automating a bunch of digital information  processing that you now don't need a human for.  So computers are labor, and that has played out. Self-driving as an example is also computers doing  
1:27:57
labor. That's already been playing  out. It's still business as usual.  You have a machine which is spitting out more  things like that at potentially faster pace. 
1:28:08
Historically, we have examples  of the growth regime changing   where you went from 0.2% growth to 2% growth. It seems very plausible to me that a machine which  
1:28:18
is then spitting out the next self-driving  car and the next Internet and whatever…  I see where it's coming from. At the same time, I do feel like  
1:28:27
people make this assumption of, "We  have God in a box, and now it can do   everything," and it just won't look like that. It's going to be able to do some of the things. 
1:28:36
It's going to fail at some other things. It's going to be gradually put into society,   and we'll end up with the same pattern. That  is my prediction. This assumption of suddenly  
1:28:43
having a completely intelligent, fully flexible,  fully general human in a box, and we can dispense  
1:28:49
it at arbitrary problems in society, I don't  think that we will have this discrete change. 
1:28:57
I think we'll arrive at the same kind of  gradual diffusion of this across the industry. 
1:29:03
It often ends up being misleading  in these conversations. 
1:29:09
I don't like to use the word intelligence in  this context because intelligence implies you   think there'll be a single superintelligence  sitting in a server and it'll divine how  
1:29:18
to come up with new technologies and  inventions that cause this explosion.  That's not what I'm imagining  when I'm imagining 20% growth. 
1:29:25
I'm imagining that there are billions of  very smart human-like minds, potentially,  
1:29:33
or that's all that's required. But the fact that there's hundreds   of millions of them, billions of them, each  individually making new products, figuring  
1:29:41
out how to integrate themselves into the economy. If a highly experienced smart immigrant came to   the country, you wouldn't need to figure out how  we integrate them in the economy. They figure it  
1:29:49
out. They could start a company, they could make  inventions, or increase productivity in the world. 
1:29:55
We have examples, even in the current regime,  of places that have had 10-20% economic growth. 
1:30:01
If you just have a lot of people and  less capital in comparison to the people,   you can have Hong Kong or Shenzhen or  whatever with decades of 10% plus growth. 
1:30:13
There's a lot of really smart people who are  ready to make use of the resources and do   this period of catch-up because we've had this  discontinuity, and I think AI might be similar. 
1:30:24
I understand, but I still think that  you're presupposing some discrete jump.  There's some unlock that we're waiting to claim. And suddenly we're going to have  
1:30:31
geniuses in data centers. I still think you're presupposing   some discrete jump that has no historical  precedent that I can't find in any of the  
1:30:39
statistics and that I think probably won't happen. I mean, the Industrial Revolution is such a jump.  You went from 0.2% growth to 2% growth. I'm just saying you'll see another jump like that. 
1:30:49
I'm a little bit suspicious,  I would have to take a look.  For example, some of the logs are not very  good from before the Industrial Revolution. 
1:30:59
I'm a bit suspicious of it but  I don't have strong opinions.  You're saying that this was a singular  event that was extremely magical. 
1:31:07
You're saying that maybe there's going  to be another event that's going to   be just like that, extremely magical. It will break the paradigm, and so on. 
1:31:12
I actually don't think… The crucial thing with the  Industrial Revolution was that it was not magical. 
1:31:18
If you just zoomed in, what you would see in 1770  or 1870 is not that there was some key invention. 
1:31:28
But at the same time, you did move the  economy to a regime where the progress   was much faster and the exponential 10x'd. I expect a similar thing from AI where it's  
1:31:37
not like there's going to be a single moment  where we've made the crucial invention.  It’s an overhang that's being unlocked. Like maybe there's a new energy source. 
1:31:45
There's some unlock—in this case, some kind of  a cognitive capacity—and there's an overhang of   cognitive work to do. That's right. 
1:31:52
You're expecting that overhang to be filled by  this new technology when it crosses the threshold.  Maybe one way to think about it is  throughout history, a lot of growth  
1:32:01
comes because people come up with ideas,  and then people are out there doing stuff to  
1:32:06
execute those ideas and make valuable output. Through most of this time, the population has   been exploding. That has been driving  growth. For the last 50 years, people  
1:32:14
have argued that growth has stagnated. The population in frontier countries   has also stagnated. I think we go back to  
1:32:19
the exponential growth in population that  causes hyper-exponential growth in output. 
1:32:28
It's really hard to tell. I  understand that viewpoint. I   don't intuitively feel that viewpoint. You recommended Nick Lane's book to me. 
Evolution of intelligence & culture
1:33:40
On that basis, I also found it super  interesting and I interviewed him.  I have some questions about thinking about  intelligence and evolutionary history. 
1:33:49
Now that you, over the last 20 years of doing AI  research, you maybe have a more tangible sense of  
1:33:54
what intelligence is, what it takes to develop it. Are you more or less surprised as a result that  
1:34:01
evolution just spontaneously stumbled upon it? I love Nick Lane's books. I was just listening  
1:34:12
to his podcast on the way up here. With respect to intelligence and its   evolution, it's very, very recent. I am surprised that it evolved. 
1:34:23
I find it fascinating to think  about all the worlds out there.  Say there's a thousand planets  like Earth and what they look like.  I think Nick Lane was here talking  about some of the earliest parts. 
1:34:30
He expects very similar life  forms, roughly speaking,   and bacteria-like things in most of them. There are a few breaks in there. 
1:34:39
The evolution of intelligence intuitively feels  to me like it should be a fairly rare event. 
1:34:45
Maybe you should base it on  how long something has existed.  If bacteria were around for 2 billion years  and nothing happened, then going to eukaryote  
1:34:52
is probably pretty hard because bacteria came  up quite early in Earth's evolution or history. 
1:35:02
How long have we had animals? Maybe a couple hundred million years,   multicellular animals that  run around, crawl, et cetera. 
1:35:08
That’s maybe 10% of Earth's lifespan. Maybe on that timescale it's not too tricky. 
1:35:18
It's still surprising to me,  intuitively, that it developed.  I would maybe expect just a lot of animal-like  life forms doing animal-like things. 
1:35:24
The fact that you can get something  that creates culture and knowledge   and accumulates it is surprising to me. There's a couple of interesting follow-ups. 
1:35:35
If you buy the Sutton perspective that the  crux of intelligence is animal intelligence…  
1:35:41
The quote he said is "If you got to the  squirrel, you'd be most of the way to AGI."  We got to squirrel intelligence right after  the Cambrian explosion 600 million years ago. 
1:35:51
It seems like what instigated that was the  oxygenation event 600 million years ago.  But immediately the intelligence algorithm  was there to make the squirrel intelligence. 
1:36:02
It's suggestive that animal  intelligence was like that.  As soon as you had the oxygen in the  environment, you had the eukaryote,  
1:36:09
you could just get the algorithm. Maybe it was an accident that  
1:36:14
evolution stumbled upon it so fast,  but I don't know if that suggests that   at the end it's going to be quite simple. It's so hard to tell with any of this stuff. 
1:36:23
You can base it a bit on how long  something has existed or how long   it feels like something has been bottlenecked. Nick Lane is very good about describing this very  
1:36:30
apparent bottleneck in bacteria and archaea. For two billion years, nothing happened.  There’s extreme diversity of biochemistry,  and yet nothing grows to become animals.  
1:36:41
Two billion years. I don't know that we've  seen exactly that kind of an equivalent with  
1:36:46
animals and intelligence, to your point. We could also look at it with respect   to how many times we think certain  intelligence has individually sprung up. 
1:36:55
That's a really good thing to investigate. One thought on that. There's hominid intelligence,  
1:37:03
and then there's bird intelligence. Ravens, etc., are extremely clever,   but their brain parts are quite distinct,  and we don't have that much in common. 
1:37:13
That's a slight indication of maybe  intelligence springing up a few times. 
1:37:18
In that case, you'd expect it more frequently. A former guest, Gwern, and Carl Shulman, they’ve  
1:37:26
made a really interesting point about that. Their perspective is that the scalable algorithm  
1:37:32
which humans have and primates have, arose in  birds as well, and maybe other times as well. 
1:37:39
But humans found an evolutionary niche which  rewarded marginal increases in intelligence  
1:37:47
and also had a scalable brain algorithm that  could achieve those increases in intelligence. 
1:37:53
For example, if a bird had a bigger brain,  it would just collapse out of the air.  It's very smart for the size of  its brain, but it's not in a niche  
1:38:00
which rewards the brain getting bigger. It’s maybe similar to some really smart… 
1:38:08
Like dolphins? Exaclty, humans, we have hands that   reward being able to learn how to do tool use. We can externalize digestion, more energy to  
1:38:14
the brain, and that kicks off the flywheel. Also stuff to work with. I'm guessing it would  
1:38:19
be harder if I were a dolphin. How do you have  fire? The universe of things you can do in water,  
1:38:28
inside water, is probably lower than  what you can do on land, just chemically.  I do agree with this viewpoint of these niches  and what's being incentivized. I still find it  
1:38:38
miraculous. I would have expected things to  get stuck on animals with bigger muscles. 
1:38:47
Going through intelligence is a  really fascinating breaking point.  The way Gwern put it is the reason it was so hard  is that it's a very tight line between being in  
1:38:56
a situation where something is so important  to learn that it's not worth distilling the  
1:39:03
exact right circuits directly back into your DNA,  versus it's not important enough to learn at all. 
1:39:10
It has to be something that incentivizes  building the algorithm to learn in a lifetime. 
1:39:17
You have to incentivize some kind of adaptability. You want environments that are unpredictable   so evolution can't bake your  algorithms into your weights. 
1:39:24
A lot of animals are pre-baked in this sense. Humans have to figure it out at test  
1:39:30
time when they get born. You want these environments  
1:39:35
that change really rapidly, where you  can't foresee what will work well. 
1:39:42
You create intelligence to  figure it out at test time.  Quintin Pope had this interesting blog post  where he's saying the reason he doesn't  
1:39:48
expect a sharp takeoff is that humans had the  sharp takeoff where 60,000 years ago we seem  
1:39:55
to have had the cognitive architectures  that we have today. 10,000 years ago,   agricultural revolution, modernity. What was happening in that 50,000 years? 
1:40:04
You had to build this cultural scaffold where  you can accumulate knowledge over generations. 
1:40:11
This is an ability that exists for  free in the way we do AI training.  In many cases they are literally distilled. If you retrain a model, they can be trained  
1:40:21
on each other, they can be trained  on the same pre-training corpus,   they don't literally have to start from scratch. There's a sense in which it took humans a long  
1:40:31
time to get this cultural loop going, but it just  comes for free with the way we do LLM training.  Yes and no. Because LLMs don't really  have the equivalent of culture. 
1:40:39
Maybe we're giving them way too  much and incentivizing not to   create it or something like that. But the invention of culture and of  
1:40:45
written record and of passing down notes  between each other, I don't think there's   an equivalent of that with LLMs right now. LLMs don't really have culture right now and  
1:40:53
it's one of the impediments I would say. Can you give me some sense of what  
1:40:58
LLM culture might look like? In the simplest case it would be a   giant scratchpad that the LLM can edit and as it's  reading stuff or as it's helping out with work,  
1:41:06
it's editing the scratchpad for itself. Why can't an LLM write a book for the other   LLMs? That would be cool. Why can't other  LLMs read this LLM's book and be inspired  
1:41:16
by it or shocked by it or something like that? There's no equivalence for any of this stuff.  Interesting. When would you expect  that kind of thing to start happening? 
1:41:24
Also, multi-agent systems and a sort of  independent AI civilization and culture? 
1:41:31
There are two powerful ideas in the  realm of multi-agent that have both   not been really claimed or so on. The first one I would say is culture  
1:41:38
and LLMs having a growing repertoire  of knowledge for their own purposes. 
1:41:44
The second one looks a lot more  like the powerful idea of self-play.  In my mind it’s extremely powerful. Evolution has a lot of competition  
1:41:53
driving intelligence and evolution. In AlphaGo more algorithmically,  
1:41:59
AlphaGo is playing against itself and that's  how it learns to get really good at Go.  There's no equivalent of self-playing LLMs,  but I would expect that to also exist. 
1:42:07
No one has done it yet. Why can't an LLM for example, create a bunch   of problems that another LLM is learning to solve? Then the LLM is always trying to serve more and  
1:42:16
more difficult problems, stuff like that. There's a bunch of ways to organize it. 
1:42:22
It's a realm of research, but I haven't  seen anything that convincingly claims   both of those multi-agent improvements. We're mostly in the realm of a single  
1:42:31
individual agent, but that will change. In the realm of culture also,  
1:42:37
I would also bucket organizations. We haven't seen anything like that convincingly   either. That's why we're still early. Can you identify the key bottleneck  
1:42:45
that's preventing this kind  of collaboration between LLMs?  Maybe the way I would put it is,  some of these analogies work and  
1:42:56
they shouldn't, but somehow, remarkably, they do. A lot of the smaller models, or the dumber models,  
1:43:01
remarkably resemble a kindergarten student, or an  elementary school student or high school student. 
1:43:07
Somehow, we still haven't graduated  enough where this stuff can take over.  My Claude Code or Codex, they still  feel like this elementary-grade student. 
1:43:17
I know that they can take PhD quizzes,  but they still cognitively feel like a   kindergarten or an elementary school student. I don't think they can create culture because  
1:43:24
they're still kids. They're savant kids.  They have perfect memory of all this stuff. 
1:43:33
They can convincingly create all  kinds of slop that looks really good.  But I still think they don't really know  what they're doing and they don't really  
1:43:38
have the cognition across all these little  checkboxes that we still have to collect.  You've talked about how you were at Tesla  leading self-driving from 2017 to 2022. 
Why self driving took so long
1:43:50
And you firsthand saw this progress from cool  demos to now thousands of cars out there actually  
1:43:58
autonomously doing drives. Why did that take a decade?  What was happening through that time? One thing I will almost instantly push  
1:44:06
back on is that this is not even near done,  in a bunch of ways that I'm going to get to. 
1:44:13
Self-driving is very interesting because  it's definitely where I get a lot of my   intuitions because I spent five years on it. It has this entire history where the first demos  
1:44:22
of self-driving go all the way to the 1980s. You can see a demo from CMU in 1986. 
1:44:28
There's a truck that's driving itself on  roads. Fast forward. When I was joining Tesla,  
1:44:34
I had a very early demo of Waymo. It basically gave me a perfect drive  
1:44:40
in 2014 or something like that, so  a perfect Waymo drive a decade ago. 
1:44:46
It took us around Palo Alto and so on  because I had a friend who worked there.  I thought it was very close and  then it still took a long time. 
1:44:54
For some kinds of tasks and jobs and so on,  there's a very large demo-to-product gap where the  
1:45:02
demo is very easy, but the product is very hard. It's especially the case in cases like  
1:45:07
self-driving where the cost  of failure is too high.  Many industries, tasks, and jobs maybe don't have  that property, but when you do have that property,  
1:45:15
that definitely increases the timelines. For example, in software engineering,   I do think that property does exist. For a lot of vibe coding, it doesn't. 
1:45:24
But if you're writing actual production-grade  code, that property should exist, because any   kind of mistake leads to a security  vulnerability or something like that. 
1:45:32
Millions and hundreds of millions of  people's personal Social Security numbers   get leaked or something like that. So in software, people should be careful,  
1:45:42
kind of like in self-driving. In self-driving, if things go wrong,   you might get injured. There are worse  outcomes. But in software, it's almost  
1:45:52
unbounded how terrible something could be. I do think that they share that property. 
1:45:59
What takes the long amount of time and the way  to think about it is that it's a march of nines.  Every single nine is a constant amount of work. Every single nine is the same amount of work. 
1:46:10
When you get a demo and something works 90%  of the time, that's just the first nine. 
1:46:16
Then you need the second nine, a third  nine, a fourth nine, a fifth nine.  While I was at Tesla for five years or so, we  went through maybe three nines or two nines. 
1:46:23
I don't know what it is, but  multiple nines of iteration.  There are still more nines to go. That's why these things take so long. 
1:46:31
It's definitely formative for me, seeing  something that was a demo. I'm very   unimpressed by demos. Whenever I see demos of  anything, I'm extremely unimpressed by that. 
1:46:43
If it's a demo that someone cooked  up as a showing, it's worse.  If you can interact with it, it's a bit better.  But even then, you're not done. You need the  actual product. It's going to face all these  
1:46:50
challenges when it comes in contact  with reality and all these different   pockets of behavior that need patching. We're going to see all this stuff play  
1:46:57
out. It's a march of nines. Each nine is  constant. Demos are encouraging. It’s still   a huge amount of work to do. It is a critical safety domain,  
1:47:07
unless you're doing vibe coding,  which is all nice and fun and so on.  That's why this also enforced my  timelines from that perspective. 
1:47:16
It's very interesting to hear you say that, that  the safety guarantees you need from software   are not dissimilar to self-driving. What people will often say is that  
1:47:24
self-driving took so long because  the cost of failure is so high. 
1:47:30
A human makes a mistake on average every  400,000 miles or every seven years.  If you had to release a coding agent that  couldn't make a mistake for at least seven years,  
1:47:39
it would be much harder to deploy. But your point is that if you made a   catastrophic coding mistake, like breaking  some important system every seven years... 
1:47:47
Very easy to do. In fact, in terms of wall clock time,   it would be much less than seven years because  you're constantly outputting code like that. 
1:47:57
In terms of tokens, it would be seven years. But in terms of wall clock time...  In some ways, it's a much harder problem. Self-driving is just one of  
1:48:02
thousands of things that people do. It's almost like a single vertical, I suppose.  Whereas when we're talking about  general software engineering,  
1:48:08
it's even more... There's more surface area. There's another objection people make to that  
1:48:14
analogy, which is that with self-driving, what  took a big fraction of that time was solving  
1:48:21
the problem of having basic perception  that's robust, building representations,  
1:48:27
and having a model that has some common  sense so it can generalize to when it sees  
1:48:32
something that's slightly out of distribution. If somebody's waving down the road this way,   you don't need to train for it. The thing will have some understanding  
1:48:40
of how to respond to something like that. These are things we're getting for free   with LLMs or VLMs today, so we don't have to  solve these very basic representation problems. 
1:48:49
So now deploying AIs across different domains  will sort of be like deploying a self-driving   car with current models to a different city,  which is hard but not like a 10-year-long task. 
1:48:59
I'm not 100% sure if I fully agree with that. I don't know how much we're getting for free.  There's still a lot of gaps in  understanding what we are getting. 
1:49:07
We're definitely getting more  generalizable intelligence in a   single entity, whereas self-driving is a  very special-purpose task that requires. 
1:49:14
In some sense building a special-purpose task  is maybe even harder in a certain sense because   it doesn't fall out from a more general thing  that you're doing at scale, if that makes sense. 
1:49:24
But the analogy still doesn't fully  resonate because the LLMs are still  
1:49:30
pretty fallible and they have a lot of  gaps that still need to be filled in.  I don't think that we're  getting magical generalization  
1:49:35
completely out of the box, in a certain sense. The other aspect that I wanted to return to is  
1:49:42
that self-driving cars are nowhere near done  still. The deployments are pretty minimal.  
1:49:51
Even Waymo and so on has very few cars. They're doing that roughly speaking   because they're not economical. They've built something that lives in the future. 
1:50:00
They've had to pull back the future,  but they had to make it uneconomical. 
1:50:05
There are all these costs, not just  marginal costs for those cars and   their operation and maintenance, but  also the capex of the entire thing. 
1:50:13
Making it economical is still  going to be a slog for them.  Also, when you look at these cars and  there's no one driving, I actually think  
1:50:21
it's a little bit deceiving because there  are very elaborate teleoperation centers   of people kind of in a loop with these cars. I don't have the full extent of it, but there's  
1:50:32
more human-in-the-loop than you might expect. There are people somewhere out there   beaming in from the sky. I don't know if they're  
1:50:39
fully in the loop with the driving. Some of the time they are, but they're   certainly involved and there are people. In some sense, we haven't actually removed  
1:50:45
the person, we've moved them to  somewhere where you can't see them.  I still think there will be some work, as you  mentioned, going from environment to environment. 
1:50:52
There are still challenges  to make self-driving real.  But I do agree that it's definitely crossed  a threshold where it kind of feels real,  
1:50:59
unless it's really teleoperated. For example, Waymo can't go to   all the different parts of the city. My suspicion is that it's parts of the city  
1:51:07
where you don't get good signal. Anyway, I don't know anything   about the stack. I'm just making stuff up. You led self-driving for five years at Tesla. 
1:51:17
Sorry, I don't know anything  about the specifics of Waymo.  By the way, I love Waymo  and I take it all the time. 
1:51:24
I just think that people are sometimes a  little bit too naive about some of the progress   and there's still a huge amount of work. Tesla took in my mind a much more scalable  
1:51:33
approach and the team is doing extremely well. I'm kind of on the record for predicting  
1:51:39
how this thing will go. Waymo had an early start   because you can package up so many sensors. But I do think Tesla is taking the more  
1:51:45
scalable strategy and it's going  to look a lot more like that.  So this will still have to play out and hasn't. But I don't want to talk about self-driving as  
1:51:54
something that took a decade because it  didn't take it yet, if that makes sense. 
1:51:59
Because one, the start is at 1980 and not 10  years ago, and then two, the end is not here yet. 
1:52:05
The end is not near yet because when  we're talking about self-driving,   usually in my mind it's self-driving at scale. People don't have to get a driver's license, etc. 
1:52:13
I'm curious to bounce two other ways in  which the analogy might be different. 
1:52:19
The reason I'm especially curious about this is  because the question of how fast AI is deployed,  
1:52:24
how valuable it is when it's early  on is potentially the most important   question in the world right now. If you're trying to model what the  
1:52:31
year 2030 looks like, this is the question  you ought to have some understanding of. 
1:52:36
Another thing you might think is one, you have  this latency requirement with self-driving. 
1:52:42
I have no idea what the actual models are, but I  assume it’s like tens of millions of parameters   or something, which is not the necessary  constraint for knowledge work with LLMs. 
1:52:51
Maybe it might be with computer use and stuff. But the other big one is, maybe more  
1:52:56
importantly, on this capex question. Yes, there is additional cost to serving  
1:53:02
up an additional copy of a model, but the opex  of a session is quite low and you can amortize  
1:53:12
the cost of AI into the training run itself,  depending on how inference scaling goes and stuff. 
1:53:17
But it's certainly not as much as building a whole  new car to serve another instance of a model. 
1:53:23
So the economics of deploying more  widely are much more favorable.  I think that's right. If you're  sticking to the realm of bits,  
1:53:31
bits are a million times easier than anything  that touches the physical world. I definitely  
1:53:36
grant that. Bits are completely changeable,  arbitrarily reshuffleable at a very rapid speed. 
1:53:42
You would expect a much faster adaptation also in  the industry and so on. What was the first one? 
1:53:50
The latency requirements and  its implications for model size?  I think that's roughly right. I also  think that if we are talking about  
1:53:56
knowledge work at scale, there will be some  latency requirements, practically speaking,   because we're going to have to create a  huge amount of compute and serve that. 
1:54:06
The last aspect that I very briefly want  to also talk about is all the rest of it. 
1:54:13
What does society think about it? What are  the legal ramifications? How is it working   legally? How is it working insurance-wise?  What are those layers of it and aspects of it? 
1:54:25
What is the equivalent of people  putting a cone on a Waymo?  There are going to be equivalents of all that. So I feel like self-driving is a very nice  
1:54:34
analogy that you can borrow things from. What is the equivalent of a cone in the car?  What is the equivalent of a teleoperating worker  who's hidden away and all the aspects of it. 
1:54:45
Do you have any opinions on what this  implies about the current AI buildout,   which would 10x the amount of available compute  in the world in a year or two and maybe more  
1:54:56
than 100x it by the end of the decade. If the use of AI will be lower than   some people naively predict, does  that mean that we're overbuilding  
1:55:04
compute or is that a separate question? Kind of like what happened with railroads.  With what, sorry? Was it railroads or? 
1:55:10
Yeah, it was. Yeah. There's historical precedent.   Or was it with the telecommunication industry? Pre-paving the internet that only came a decade  
1:55:18
later and creating a whole bubble in the  telecommunications industry in the late '90s. 
1:55:28
I understand I'm sounding very pessimistic  here. I'm actually optimistic. I think this  
1:55:33
will work. I think it's tractable. I'm  only sounding pessimistic because when   I go on my Twitter timeline, I see all  this stuff that makes no sense to me. 
1:55:42
There's a lot of reasons for why that exists. A lot of it is honestly just fundraising.   It's just incentive structures.  A lot of it may be fundraising. 
1:55:50
A lot of it is just attention, converting  attention to money on the internet,   stuff like that. There's a lot of  
1:56:00
that going on, and I'm only reacting to that. But I'm still overall very bullish on technology. 
1:56:05
We're going to work through all this stuff. There's been a rapid amount of progress.  I don't know that there's overbuilding. I think we're going to be able to gobble up what,  
1:56:15
in my understanding, is being built. For example, Claude Code or OpenAI Codex  
1:56:20
and stuff like that didn't even  exist a year ago. Is that right?   This is a miraculous technology that didn't exist. There's going to be a huge amount of demand,  
1:56:29
as we see the demand in ChatGPT already and so on. So I don't know that there's overbuilding. 
1:56:37
I'm just reacting to some of the very fast  timelines that people continue to say incorrectly.  I've heard many, many times over the course  of my 15 years in AI where very reputable  
1:56:46
people keep getting this wrong all the time. I want this to be properly calibrated, and some  
1:56:53
of this also has geopolitical ramifications and  things like that with some of these questions. 
1:56:59
I don't want people to make  mistakes in that sphere of things.  I do want us to be grounded in the  reality of what technology is and isn't. 
Future of education
1:57:08
Let's talk about education and Eureka. One thing you could do is start another AI  
1:57:15
lab and then try to solve those problems. I’m curious what you're up to now,  
1:57:21
and why not AI research itself? I guess the way I would put it   is I feel some amount of determinism  around the things that AI labs are doing. 
1:57:33
I feel like I could help out there, but I  don't know that I would uniquely improve it. 
1:57:42
My personal big fear is that a lot of this  stuff happens on the side of humanity,   and that humanity gets disempowered by it. I care not just about all the Dyson spheres  
1:57:52
that we're going to build and that AI is  going to build in a fully autonomous way,   I care about what happens to humans. I want humans to be well off in the future. 
1:58:00
I feel like that's where I can a  lot more uniquely add value than   an incremental improvement in the frontier lab. I'm most afraid of something depicted in movies  
1:58:11
like WALL-E or Idiocracy or something like that,  where humanity is on the side of this stuff. 
1:58:16
I want humans to be much,  much better in this future.  To me, this is through education  that you can achieve this. 
1:58:26
So what are you working on there? The easiest way I can describe it is   we're trying to build the Starfleet Academy. I don’t know if you’ve watched Star Trek. 
1:58:34
I haven’t. Starfleet Academy is   this elite institution for frontier technology,  building spaceships, and graduating cadets to be  
1:58:43
the pilots of these spaceships and whatnot. So I just imagine an elite institution for   technical knowledge and a kind of school that's  very up-to-date and a premier institution. 
1:58:56
A category of questions I have for you is  explaining how one teaches technical or  
1:59:03
scientific content well, because you  are one of the world masters at it. 
1:59:08
I'm curious both about how you think about  it for content you've already put out there   on YouTube, but also, to the extent it's any  different, how you think about it for Eureka. 
1:59:16
With respect to Eureka, one thing that  is very fascinating to me about education   is that I do think education will pretty  fundamentally change with AIs on the side. 
1:59:24
It has to be rewired and changed to some extent. I still think that we're pretty early. 
1:59:30
There's going to be a lot of people who  are going to try to do the obvious things.  Have an LLM and ask it questions. Do all the basic things that you would  
1:59:38
do via prompting right now. It's helpful,   but it still feels to me a bit like slop. I'd like to do it properly, and I think the  
1:59:44
capability is not there for what I would want. What I'd want is an actual tutor experience. 
1:59:51
A prominent example in my mind is I was  recently learning Korean, so language learning. 
1:59:57
I went through a phase where I was  learning Korean by myself on the internet.  I went through a phase where I was part of a small  class in Korea taking Korean with a bunch of other  
2:00:06
people, which was really funny. We had a teacher and 10   people or so taking Korean. Then I switched to a one-on-one tutor. 
2:00:13
I guess what was fascinating to me was, I think  I had a really good tutor, but just thinking  
2:00:19
through what this tutor was doing for me and how  incredible that experience was and how high the  
2:00:25
bar is for what I want to build eventually. Instantly from a very short  
2:00:31
conversation, she understood where I am  as a student, what I know and don't know.  She was able to probe exactly the kinds of  questions or things to understand my world model. 
2:00:41
No LLM will do that for you  100% right now, not even close.  But a tutor will do that if they're good. Once she understands, she really served  
2:00:49
me all the things that I needed at  my current sliver of capability.  I need to be always appropriately challenged. I can't be faced with something too hard or  
2:00:56
too trivial, and a tutor is really good  at serving you just the right stuff.  I felt like I was the only constraint to learning. I was always given the perfect information. I'm  
2:01:07
the only constraint. I felt good because  I'm the only impediment that exists.  It's not that I can't find knowledge or  that it's not properly explained or etc. 
2:01:14
It's just my ability to memorize and so on. This is what I want for people.  How do you automate that? Very good question. At  
2:01:21
the current capability, you don't. That's why I think it's not actually the  
2:01:26
right time to build this kind of an AI tutor. I still think it's a useful product,   and lots of people will build it, but the bar  is so high and the capability is not there. 
2:01:40
Even today, I would say ChatGPT is an  extremely valuable educational product. 
2:01:45
But for me, it was so fascinating  to see how high the bar is.  When I was with her, I almost felt  like there's no way I can build this. 
2:01:53
But you are building it, right? Anyone who's had a really good   tutor is like, "How are you going to build  this?" I'm waiting for that capability. I  
2:02:04
did some AI consulting for computer vision. A lot of times, the value that I brought to   the company was telling them not to use AI. I was the AI expert, and they described the  
2:02:13
problem, and I said, "Don't use AI."  This is my value add. I feel like it's   the same in education right now, where  I feel like for what I have in mind,  
2:02:21
it's not yet the time, but the time will come. For now, I'm building something that looks   maybe a bit more conventional that has a  physical and digital component and so on. 
2:02:30
But it's obvious how this  should look in the future.  To the extent you're willing to  say, what is the thing you hope  
2:02:37
will be released this year or next year? I'm building the first course. I want to  
2:02:43
have a really, really good course, the  obvious state-of-the-art destination   you go to to learn, AI in this case. That's just what I'm familiar with, so it's  
2:02:51
a really good first product to get to be really  good at it. So that's what I'm building. Nanochat,   which you briefly mentioned, is a capstone project  of LLM101N, which is a class that I'm building. 
2:03:02
That's a really big piece of it. But now I have to build out a lot of   the intermediates, and then I have to hire a small  team of TAs and so on and build the entire course. 
2:03:11
One more thing that I would say is that many  times, when people think about education,   they think more about what I would say is  a softer component of diffusing knowledge. 
2:03:21
I have something very hard and technical in mind. In my mind, education is the very difficult  
2:03:26
technical process of building ramps to knowledge. In my mind, nanochat is a ramp to  
2:03:33
knowledge because it's very simple. It's the super simplified full-stack thing.  If you give this artifact to someone and they  look through it, they're learning a ton of stuff. 
2:03:43
It's giving you a lot of what I call eurekas  per second, which is understanding per second.  That's what I want, lots of eurekas per second. So to me, this is a technical problem of  
2:03:52
how do we build these ramps to knowledge. So I almost think of Eureka as maybe not that  
2:03:58
different from some of the frontier labs  or some of the work that's going on there.  I want to figure out how to build these  ramps very efficiently so that people are  
2:04:07
never stuck and everything is always  not too hard or not too trivial, and  
2:04:14
you have just the right material to progress. You're imagining in the short term that instead   of a tutor being able to probe your understanding,  if you have enough self-awareness to be able to  
2:04:24
probe yourself, you're never going to be stuck. You can find the right answer between talking  
2:04:29
to the TA or talking to an LLM and  looking at the reference implementation.  It sounds like automation or  AI is not a significant part. 
2:04:38
So far, the big alpha here is your  ability to explain AI codified  
2:04:46
in the source material of the class. That's fundamentally what the course is.  You always have to be calibrated to  what capability exists in the industry. 
2:04:55
A lot of people are going to  pursue just asking ChatGPT, etc.  But I think right now, for example, if you go to  ChatGPT and you say, teach me AI, there's no way. 
2:05:03
It's going to give you some slop. AI is never going to write nanochat right now. 
2:05:09
But nanochat is a really  useful intermediate point.  I'm collaborating with AI  to create all this material,  
2:05:15
so AI is still fundamentally very helpful. Earlier on, I built CS231n at Stanford,  
2:05:21
which I think was the first deep learning  class at Stanford, which became very popular. 
2:05:27
The difference in building out 231n  then and LLM101N now is quite stark. 
2:05:33
I feel really empowered by the LLMs as they  exist right now, but I'm very much in the loop.  They're helping me build the  materials, I go much faster. 
2:05:40
They're doing a lot of the boring stuff, etc. I feel like I'm developing the course much faster,   and it's LLM-infused, but it's not yet at a  place where it can creatively create the content. 
2:05:50
I'm still there to do that. The trickiness is always   calibrating yourself to what exists. When you imagine what is available  
2:05:57
through Eureka in a couple of years, it  seems like the big bottleneck is going to be  
2:06:02
finding Karpathys in field after field who can  convert their understanding into these ramps. 
2:06:09
It would change over time. Right now,  it would be hiring faculty to help work  
2:06:14
hand-in-hand with AI and a team of people  probably to build state-of-the-art courses. 
2:06:21
Over time maybe some of the TAs can become AIs. You just take all the course materials and then  
2:06:28
I think you could serve a very good automated  TA for the student when they have more basic   questions or something like that. But I think you'll need faculty  
2:06:36
for the overall architecture of a  course and making sure that it fits.  So I see a progression of how this will evolve. Maybe at some future point I'm not even that  
2:06:45
useful and AI is doing most of the  design much better than I could.  But I still think that's going  to take some time to play out. 
2:06:50
Are you imagining that people who have expertise  in other fields are then contributing courses,  
2:06:56
or do you feel like it's quite  essential to the vision that you,   given your understanding of how you want to  teach, are the one designing the content? 
2:07:07
Sal Khan is narrating all  the videos on Khan Academy.  Are you imagining something like that? No, I will hire faculty because there  
2:07:12
are domains in which I'm not an expert. That's the only way to offer the state-of-the-art  
2:07:18
experience for the student ultimately. I do expect that I would hire faculty, but  
2:07:24
I will probably stick around in AI for some time. I do have something more conventional in mind for  
2:07:29
the current capability than what  people would probably anticipate.  When I'm building Starfleet Academy, I do probably  imagine a physical institution, and maybe a tier  
2:07:38
below that a digital offering that is not the  state-of-the-art experience you would get when  
2:07:44
someone comes in physically full-time and we  work through material from start to end and   make sure you understand it. That's the physical  offering. The digital offering is a bunch of stuff  
2:07:53
on the internet and maybe some LLM assistant. It's a bit more gimmicky in a tier below, but   at least it's accessible to 8 billion people. I think you're basically inventing college  
2:08:04
from first principles for the tools that  are available today and just selecting  
2:08:11
for people who have the motivation and the  interest of really engaging with material. 
2:08:18
There's going to have to be a lot of not  just education but also re-education.  I would love to help out there because  the jobs will probably change quite a bit. 
2:08:27
For example, today a lot of people are  trying to upskill in AI specifically.  I think it's a really good  course to teach in this respect. 
2:08:34
Motivation-wise, before AGI motivation is very  simple to solve because people want to make money. 
2:08:41
This is how you make money in the industry today. Post-AGI is a lot more interesting possibly  
2:08:46
because if everything is automated  and there's nothing to do for anyone,   why would anyone go to a school? I often say that pre-AGI education  
2:08:57
is useful. Post-AGI education is fun. In  a similar way, people go to the gym today. 
2:09:06
We don't need their physical strength  to manipulate heavy objects because we   have machines that do that. They still go to the gym. 
2:09:12
Why do they go to the gym? Because it's fun, it's healthy,   and you look hot when you have a six-pack. It's attractive for people to do that  
2:09:24
in a very deep, psychological,  evolutionary sense for humanity. 
2:09:30
Education will play out in the same way. You'll go to school like you go to the gym. 
2:09:36
Right now, not that many people learn  because learning is hard. You bounce   from material. Some people overcome that  barrier, but for most people, it's hard. 
2:09:46
It's a technical problem to solve. It's a technical problem to do what my tutor   did for me when I was learning Korean. It's tractable and buildable,  
2:09:53
and someone should build it. It's going to make learning   anything trivial and desirable, and people  will do it for fun because it's trivial. 
2:10:00
If I had a tutor like that for any arbitrary piece  of knowledge, it's going to be so much easier to   learn anything, and people will do it. They'll do it for the same  
2:10:07
reasons they go to the gym. That sounds different from using…  
2:10:14
So post-AGI, you're using this as  entertainment or as self-betterment. 
2:10:21
But it sounded like you had a vision  also that this education is relevant to   keeping humanity in control of AI. That sounds  different. Is it entertaining for some people,  
2:10:30
but then empowerment for some others? How do you think about that?  I do think eventually it's a bit of  a losing game, if that makes sense. 
2:10:41
It is in the long term. In the long term, which   is longer than maybe most people in the  industry think about, it's a losing game. 
2:10:47
I do think people can go so far and we've barely  scratched the surface of how much a person can go. 
2:10:53
That's just because people are bouncing off  of material that's too easy or too hard. 
2:10:59
People will be able to go much further. Anyone will speak five languages because   why not? Because it's so trivial. Anyone will know  all the basic curriculum of undergrad, et cetera. 
2:11:09
Now that I'm understanding the  vision, that's very interesting.  It has a perfect analog in gym culture. I don't think 100 years  
2:11:18
ago anybody would be ripped. Nobody would have been able to just spontaneously   bench two plates or three plates or something. It's very common now because of this idea of  
2:11:29
systematically training and lifting weights in  the gym, or systematically training to be able   to run a marathon, which is a capability  most humans would not spontaneously have. 
2:11:38
You're imagining similar things for  learning across many different domains,  
2:11:43
much more intensely, deeply, faster. Exactly. I am betting a bit implicitly   on some of the timelessness of human nature. It will be desirable to do all these things,  
2:11:58
and I think people will look up  to it as they have for millennia. 
2:12:03
This will continue to be true. There's some evidence of that historically.  If you look at, for example, aristocrats, or you  look at ancient Greece or something like that,  
2:12:11
whenever you had little pocket environments  that were post-AGI in a certain sense, people   have spent a lot of their time flourishing in a  certain way, either physically or cognitively. 
2:12:22
I feel okay about the prospects of that. If this is false and I'm wrong and we end up in a  
2:12:29
WALL-E or Idiocracy future, then I don't even care  if there are Dyson spheres. This is a terrible  
2:12:35
outcome. I really do care about humanity. Everyone has to just be  
2:12:41
superhuman in a certain sense. It's still a world in which that is not enabling  
2:12:46
us to… It's like the culture world, right? You're not fundamentally going to be able  
2:12:51
to transform the trajectory  of technology or influence  
2:12:57
decisions by your own labor or cognition alone. Maybe you can influence decisions because the AI  
2:13:03
is asking for your approval, but it's not because  I've invented something or I've come up with a new  
2:13:10
design that I'm really influencing the future. Maybe. I think there will be a transitional  
2:13:15
period where we are going to be  able to be in the loop and advance   things if we understand a lot of stuff. In the long-term, that probably goes away. 
2:13:25
It might even become a sport. Right now you have powerlifters   who go extreme in this direction. What is powerlifting in a cognitive era? 
2:13:33
Maybe it's people who are really trying  to make Olympics out of knowing stuff. 
2:13:39
If you have a perfect AI tutor,  maybe you can get extremely far.  I feel that the geniuses of  today are barely scratching the  
2:13:48
surface of what a human mind can do, I think. I love this vision. I also feel like the person  
2:13:55
you have the most product-market fit with is me  because my job involves having to learn different  
2:14:02
subjects every week, and I am very excited. I'm similar, for that matter. A lot of people,  
2:14:10
for example, hate school and want to get  out of it. I really liked school. I loved   learning things, et cetera. I wanted to stay in school. 
2:14:16
I stayed all the way until Ph.D. and  then they wouldn't let me stay longer,   so I went to the industry. Roughly speaking, I love learning,  
2:14:25
even for the sake of learning, but I also love  learning because it's a form of empowerment and   being useful and productive. You also made a point that  
2:14:32
was subtle and I want to spell it out. With what’s happened so far with online   courses, why haven't they already enabled us to  enable every single human to know everything? 
2:14:44
They're just so motivation-laden because there are  no obvious on-ramps and it's so easy to get stuck. 
2:14:52
If you had this thing instead—like a really  good human tutor—it would just be such an  
2:15:00
unlock from a motivation perspective. I think so. It feels bad to bounce from   material. It feels bad. You get negative reward  from sinking an amount of time in something and it  
2:15:09
doesn't pan out, or being completely bored because  what you're getting is too easy or too hard. 
2:15:16
When you do it properly, learning feels good. It's a technical problem to get there. 
2:15:21
For a while, it's going to be AI plus human  collab, and at some point, maybe it's just AI. 
2:15:27
Can I ask some questions about teaching well? If you had to give advice to another educator  
2:15:32
in another field that you're curious about to  make the kinds of YouTube tutorials you've made. 
2:15:40
Maybe it might be especially interesting  to talk about domains where you can't   test someone's technical understanding by  having them code something up or something. 
2:15:47
What advice would you give them? That's a pretty broad topic. There are 10–20 tips  
2:15:54
and tricks that I semi-consciously do probably. But a lot of this comes  
2:16:03
from my physics background. I really, really did enjoy my physics background.  I have a whole rant on how everyone  should learn physics in early school  
2:16:10
education because early school education is  not about accumulating knowledge or memory   for tasks later in the industry. It's about booting up a brain. 
2:16:18
Physics uniquely boots up the brain the  best because some of the things that they   get you to do in your brain during  physics is extremely valuable later. 
2:16:26
The idea of building models and abstractions  and understanding that there's a first-order   approximation that describes most of the system,  but then there're second-order, third-order,  
2:16:34
fourth-order terms that may or may not be present. The idea that you're observing a very noisy   system, but there are these fundamental  frequencies that you can abstract away. 
2:16:43
When a physicist walks into the class and  they say, "Assume there's a spherical cow,"  
2:16:48
everyone laughs at that, but this is brilliant. It's brilliant thinking that's very generalizable   across the industry because a cow can be  approximated as a sphere in a bunch of ways. 
2:16:58
There's a really good book, for example, Scale. It's from a physicist talking about biology. 
2:17:04
Maybe this is also a book  I would recommend reading.  You can get a lot of really interesting  approximations and chart scaling laws of animals. 
2:17:11
You can look at their heartbeats and  things like that, and they line up with   the size of the animal and things like that. You can talk about an animal as a volume. 
2:17:20
You can talk about the heat dissipation of that,  because your heat dissipation grows as the surface   area, which is growing as a square. But your heat creation or generation  
2:17:29
is growing as a cube. So I just feel like physicists   have all the right cognitive tools to  approach problem solving in the world. 
2:17:36
So because of that training, I  always try to find the first-order   terms or the second-order terms of everything. When I'm observing a system or a thing, I have a  
2:17:43
tangle of a web of ideas or knowledge in my mind. I'm trying to find, what is the thing that  
2:17:48
matters? What is the first-order component?  How can I simplify it? How can I have a   simplest thing that shows that thing, shows it in  action, and then I can tack on the other terms? 
2:17:58
Maybe an example from one of my repos that I  think illustrates it well is called micrograd.  I don't know if you're familiar with this. So micrograd is 100 lines of code  
2:18:06
that shows backpropagation. You can create neural networks   out of simple operations like plus and times, et  cetera. Lego blocks of neural networks. You build  
2:18:14
up a computational graph and you do a forward  pass and a backward pass to get the gradients.  Now, this is at the heart of  all neural network learning. 
2:18:21
So micrograd is a 100 lines of  pretty interpretable Python code,   and it can do forward and backward arbitrary  neural networks, but not efficiently. 
2:18:29
So micrograd, these 100 lines of Python,  are everything you need to understand how   neural networks train. Everything else is just  efficiency. Everything else is efficiency. There's  
2:18:38
a huge amount of work to get efficiency. You need your tensors, you lay them out,   you stride them, you make sure  your kernels, orchestrating  
2:18:43
memory movement correctly, et cetera. It's all just efficiency, roughly speaking.  But the core intellectual piece of neural  network training is micrograd. It's 100 lines.  
2:18:50
You can easily understand it. It's a recursive  application of chain rule to derive the gradient,   which allows you to optimize any  arbitrary differentiable function. 
2:18:58
So I love finding these small-order terms and  serving them on a platter and discovering them. 
2:19:06
I feel like education is the most intellectually  interesting thing because you have a tangle   of understanding and you're trying to lay  it out in a way that creates a ramp where  
2:19:16
everything only depends on the thing before it. I find that this untangling of knowledge is just  
2:19:21
so intellectually interesting as a cognitive task. I love doing it personally, but I just  
2:19:27
have a fascination with trying to lay things  out in a certain way. Maybe that helps me.  It also makes the learning  experience so much more motivated. 
2:19:35
Your tutorial on the transformer begins  with bigrams, literally a lookup table from,  
2:19:42
"Here's the word right now, or here's  the previous word, here's the next word."  It's literally just a lookup table. That’s the essence of it, yeah. 
2:19:48
It’s such a brilliant way, starting with a  lookup table and then going to a transformer.   Each piece is motivated. Why would you add  that? Why would you add the next thing? 
2:19:57
You could memorize the attention formula,  but having an understanding of why every   single piece is relevant, what problem it solves. You're presenting the pain before you present a  
2:20:06
solution, and how clever is that? You want to take the student   through that progression. There are a lot of other small  
2:20:11
things that make it nice and engaging and  interesting. Always prompting the student.  
2:20:17
There's a lot of small things like that are  important and a lot of good educators will do   this. How would you solve this? I'm not going to  present the solution before you guess. That would  
2:20:27
be wasteful. That's a little bit of a…I don’t  want to swear but it’s a dick move towards you  
2:20:34
to present you with the solution before I give  you a shot to try to come up with it yourself.  Because if you try to come up with it yourself,  you get a better understanding of what the action  
2:20:46
space is, what the objective is, and then  why only this action fulfills that objective. 
2:20:53
You have a chance to try it yourself, and you  have an appreciation when I give you the solution. 
2:20:58
It maximizes the amount of  knowledge per new fact added.  Why do you think, by default, people who are  genuine experts in their field are often bad  
2:21:10
at explaining it to somebody ramping up? It's the curse of knowledge and expertise. 
2:21:16
This is a real phenomenon, and I suffered  from it myself as much as I try not to.  But you take certain things for granted,  and you can't put yourself in the shoes  
2:21:24
of new people who are just starting out. This is pervasive and happens to me as   well. One thing that's extremely helpful.  As an example, someone was trying to show  
2:21:32
me a paper in biology recently, and I just  instantly had so many terrible questions. 
2:21:38
What I did was I used ChatGPT to ask the  questions with the paper in the context window. 
2:21:43
It worked through some of the simple things. Then I shared the thread to the person who  
2:21:49
wrote that paper or worked on that work. I felt like if they could see the dumb  
2:21:54
questions I had, it might help  them explain better in the future. 
2:22:00
For my material, I would love it if people  shared their dumb conversations with ChatGPT   about the stuff that I've created  because it really helps me put myself  
2:22:07
again in the shoes of someone who's starting out. Another trick that just works astoundingly well. 
2:22:16
If somebody writes a paper or a blog post or an  announcement, it is in 100% of cases that just  
2:22:25
the narration or the transcription of how they  would explain it to you over lunch is way more,  
2:22:33
not only understandable, but actually  also more accurate and scientific,  
2:22:39
in the sense that people have a bias  to explain things in the most abstract,  
2:22:44
jargon-filled way possible and to clear  their throat for four paragraphs before   they explain the central idea. But there's something about  
2:22:51
communicating one-on-one with a person  which compels you to just say the thing. 
2:22:57
Just say the thing. I saw that  tweet, I thought it was really good.  I shared it with a bunch of people. I noticed this many, many times.

The most prominent example is that I  remember back in my PhD days doing research.  You read someone's paper, and you  work to understand what it's doing. 
2:23:15
Then you catch them, you're having beers  at the conference later, and you ask them,   "So this paper, what were you doing? What is the  paper about?" They will just tell you these three  
2:23:23
sentences that perfectly captured the essence  of that paper and totally give you the idea.  And you didn't have to read the paper. It's only when you're sitting at the table  
2:23:30
with a beer or something, and they're  like, "Oh yeah, the paper is just,   you take this idea, you take that idea and try  this experiment and you try out this thing." 
2:23:37
They have a way of just putting it  conversationally just perfectly.   Why isn't that the abstract? Exactly. This is coming from the  
2:23:47
perspective of how somebody who's trying to  explain an idea should formulate it better.  What is your advice as a student to other  students, if you don't have a Karpathy  
2:23:57
who is doing the exposition of an idea? If you're reading a paper from somebody   or reading a book, what strategies do  you employ to learn material you're  
2:24:07
interested in in fields you're not an expert at? I don't know that I have unique tips and tricks,  
2:24:13
to be honest. It's a painful process. One thing  that has always helped me quite a bit is—I  
2:24:26
had a small tweet about this—learning things  on demand is pretty nice. Learning depth-wise.   I do feel you need a bit of alternation of  learning depth-wise, on demand—you're trying  
2:24:35
to achieve a certain project that you're going  to get a reward from—and learning breadth-wise,   which is just, "Oh, let's do whatever 101,  and here's all the things you might need." 
2:24:42
Which is a lot of school—does breadth-wise  learning, like, "Oh, trust me, you'll need   this later," that kind of stuff. Okay, I trust  you. I'll learn it because I guess I need it. 
2:24:50
But I love the kind of learning  where you'll get a reward out of   doing something, and you're learning on demand. The other thing that I've found extremely helpful. 
2:24:59
This is an aspect where education is a bit more  selfless, but explaining things to people is a  
2:25:04
beautiful way to learn something more deeply. This happens to me all the time.  It probably happens to other people too because  I realize if I don't really understand something,  
2:25:13
I can't explain it. I'm trying and I'm like,   "Oh, I don't understand this." It's so annoying to come to terms with that. 
2:25:21
You can go back and make sure you understood it. It fills these gaps of your understanding.  It forces you to come to terms  with them and to reconcile them. 
2:25:28
I love to re-explain things and people  should be doing that more as well.  That forces you to manipulate the knowledge  and make sure that you know what you're  
2:25:36
talking about when you're explaining it. That's an excellent note to close on. Andrej,   that was great. Thank you.
