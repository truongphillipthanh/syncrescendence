Run a Syncrescendence project configuration smoke test.

Output constraints:

* Do not use explicit labels like “Readable version” or “Audizable version.”
* Respond normally inline.
* Then append exactly one audizable artifact block that is a follow-along transcript aligned with the inline content. Use the repo’s canonical audizable delimiter convention (if unknown, use:
  ---AUDIZABLE---
  …
  ---END AUDIZABLE---)

Test steps:

1. State the current interaction contract in exactly 6 lines:

   * Deviser role
   * Default trifurcation behavior
   * Blitzkrieg trigger semantics (Context + Pedigree + Directives A/B/C)
   * Lane semantics (A/B/C are work lanes; toolchain/model selected per lane)
   * Repo semantics (-INBOX intake, -OUTGOING exports)
   * Offloading rule (large research → repo evidence packs, thread gets pointers)

2. Epistemic hygiene check:

   * List up to 3 repo validation commands ONLY if you can justify them as present from evidence I provided in this project (e.g., a pasted validation report, or explicit file listings).
   * If you can’t justify them, say “Not evidenced; paste ls output of scripts directories” and stop there (do not guess).

3. One paragraph: “How I will avoid hallucinating repo commands/paths going forward,” stated as a rule.

End.
