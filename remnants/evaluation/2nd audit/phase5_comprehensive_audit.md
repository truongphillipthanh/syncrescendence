## III. CRITICAL PLACEMENT ANALYSIS: SEVEN-LAYER STACK

### A. The Question

**Current Location**: CANON-31130 (Information Chain → Planetary Acumen → Lunar)

**Question**: Should this artifact be relocated to Intelligence Chain (CANON-30000) as a comet-level system?

### B. Arguments For Information Chain (Current Placement)

**Argument 1: Functional Purpose**
- The Stack's purpose is **information architecture** and **platform strategy**
- Layers 5-7 explicitly deal with content platforms, information consumption, and distribution
- IIC Constellation (which depends on Stack) is fundamentally about **organizing information flows**

**Argument 2: Acumen Alignment**
- Acumen (Information Planetary) is specifically about:
  - Platform presence and literacy
  - Signal detection and curation
  - Attention sovereignty
  - Information environment navigation
- Seven-Layer Stack directly serves these Acumen functions

**Argument 3: Dependency Architecture**
- IIC Constellation (CANON-31140) **explicitly depends** on Seven-Layer Stack
- IIC is unambiguously Information Chain content (multi-account intelligence for sensing/perception)
- Moving Stack to Intelligence would create cross-chain dependency (Intelligence → Information)
- Current placement maintains clean intra-chain dependency (both under Information)

**Argument 4: Layers 5-7 Content**
- Layer 5: Content Platforms (consumption + distribution)
- Layer 6: Productivity/Creation Tools  
- Layer 7: Meta-Intelligence Orchestration
- These are fundamentally about **information flow**, not technology capability

**Argument 5: Stack Definition From Document**
```
"You are not managing accounts. You are engineering 
identity-intelligence complexes across a seven-layer 
technosphere stack to maintain sovereignty amid pervasive 
intelligencing while capitalizing on ecosystem economies of scale.

This is civilizational-scale information architecture 
applied to individual practice."
```
Key phrase: **"information architecture"** — not "technology mastery"

### C. Arguments For Intelligence Chain (Proposed Relocation)

**Argument 1: Technology Infrastructure Focus**
- Layers 0-4 are explicitly about:
  - Operating systems and devices
  - Authentication and identity federation
  - Ambient AI and system-level intelligence
  - Browser intelligence
  - Application-level AI platforms
- These are fundamentally **technology decisions**

**Argument 2: Intelligence Chain Scope**
From CANON-30000:
```
"The Technology Chain establishes artificial intelligence 
collaboration and tool mastery as foundational substrate 
supporting all other chains."
```
- Seven-Layer Stack is about **AI integration at system level**
- About **tool selection and configuration**
- About **technology sovereignty**

**Argument 3: Substrate Function**
- Intelligence Chain operates as "non-local substrate" enabling all other chains
- Seven-Layer Stack provides the **technological infrastructure** that enables all practice
- It's the foundation on which information flows, not the information flow itself

**Argument 4: Naming Pattern**
- Intelligence Chain uses "comet" metaphor for major operational supplements
- Seven-Layer Stack could be CANON-30400 (fourth comet under Intelligence)
- Current comets: 30100 (ASA), 30200 (Strategic Positioning), 30300 (Technology Stack Database)
- Seven-Layer Stack is essentially a comprehensive **Technology Stack** specification

**Argument 5: Cross-Chain Relevance**
- The Stack isn't just for Information Chain — it enables ALL chains
- It's infrastructure that supports Coherence IIC, Efficacy IIC, Mastery IIC, etc.
- Placing it under Information Chain suggests it's only relevant to sensing/perception
- Intelligence Chain's "substrate function" better reflects its universal applicability

### D. Hybrid Consideration: Bridge Document Status

**Alternative View**: Seven-Layer Stack is a **bridge document** that:
1. Specifies technology infrastructure (Intelligence concern)
2. FOR the purpose of organizing information flows (Information concern)
3. TO enable effective sensing and platform presence (Acumen concern)

**Precedent**: Some documents naturally span multiple chains. The question is which chain houses the canonical version.

### E. Dependency Chain Analysis

**Current Structure** (Stack under Information):
```
CANON-30000 (Intelligence Chain)
CANON-31000 (Information Chain)
  └─ CANON-31100 (Planetary Acumen)
      ├─ CANON-31110 (Feedcraft)
      ├─ CANON-31120 (Tone Library)
      ├─ CANON-31130 (Seven-Layer Stack) ← Currently here
      └─ CANON-31140 (IIC Constellation) ← Depends on 31130
          ├─ CANON-31141 (Five-Account Architecture)
          ├─ CANON-31142 (Platform Grammar)
          └─ CANON-31143 (Feed Curation)
```

**Proposed Structure** (Stack under Intelligence):
```
CANON-30000 (Intelligence Chain)
  ├─ CANON-30100 (ASA Model)
  ├─ CANON-30200 (Strategic Positioning)
  ├─ CANON-30300 (Technology Stack Database)
  └─ CANON-30400 (Seven-Layer Stack) ← Proposed new location

CANON-31000 (Information Chain)
  └─ CANON-31100 (Planetary Acumen)
      ├─ CANON-31110 (Feedcraft)
      ├─ CANON-31120 (Tone Library)
      └─ CANON-31140 (IIC Constellation) ← Would depend on 30400
          └─ ... (satellites unchanged)
```

**Dependency Implication**: Moving Stack to Intelligence creates **cross-chain dependency** (Information Chain depending on Intelligence Chain document).

**Is This Problematic?**
- Actually, NO — Information Chain (CANON-31000) already depends on Intelligence Chain
- From CANON-31000: *"Technology Stage 1 enables other chains"*
- Cross-chain dependencies are natural and explicitly acknowledged
- Intelligence as substrate supports all chains including Information

### F. Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION**: **MAINTAIN CURRENT PLACEMENT** under Information Chain (CANON-31130)

**Primary Rationale**:
1. **Functional Purpose Clarity**: The Stack's explicit purpose is "information architecture" and "platform strategy for sensing/curation"
2. **Dependency Chain Logic**: IIC Constellation depends on Stack; both serve Information Chain functions
3. **Acumen Alignment**: Stack directly serves Acumen's core functions (platform literacy, signal detection)
4. **Layers 5-7 Weight**: Half the document is about content platforms and information flow
5. **Document Self-Identification**: Opening states it's "civilizational-scale information architecture"

**Secondary Consideration**:
- While Layers 0-4 are technology infrastructure, they're infrastructure **in service of** information sovereignty
- The document isn't about technology mastery for its own sake — it's about configuring technology for strategic intelligence gathering
- This aligns with Acumen's perceptual sophistication mission

**Alternative Enhancement**:
- Add strong cross-reference from Intelligence Chain (CANON-30000) noting that Seven-Layer Stack (CANON-31130) specifies the technology infrastructure
- In CANON-30300 (Technology Stack Database), reference that CANON-31130 provides systematic architecture
- Acknowledge the bridge function explicitly in both chains

**If Relocation Insisted**:
- Could defensibly move to CANON-30400 under Intelligence
- Would require updating all IIC references
- Would establish cross-chain dependency (Information → Intelligence)
- Would need clear documentation that Stack serves all chains, not just Intelligence

### G. Resolution Protocol

**Immediate Action**: Flag this question for human architect decision

**Options**:
1. **Maintain Current** (CANON-31130 under Information) — Recommended
2. **Relocate** (CANON-30400 under Intelligence) — Defensible but creates work
3. **Duplicate Reference** (Primary location + strong cross-reference) — Possible but adds complexity

**Decision Criteria**:
- Which chain's practitioners need this document most? (Information practitioners for IIC)
- What's the document's primary function? (Information architecture, not technology mastery)
- Where does dependency chain logic lead? (IIC depends on Stack, both serve Information)
- What does the document say about itself? ("information architecture")

## VI. FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS ASSESSMENT

### A. Current Naming Pattern

**Standard Format**: `CANON-[NUMBER]-[LEVEL]-[NAME]-[VERSION].md`

Examples:
- `CANON-00001-cosmos-SYNCRESCENDENCE-v2_3.md`
- `CANON-31130-chain-INFORMATION-planetary-ACUMEN-lunar-SEVEN_LAYER_STACK-v1_0.md`
- `CANON-30310-chain-INTELLIGENCE-comet-TECHNOLOGY_STACK_DATABASE-asteroid-COMPLETE_MIGRATION.md`

### B. Naming Convention Analysis

**Level Descriptors Used**:
- `cosmos` — Governance layer (00000-00009)
- `core` — Generative center (10000-11000)
- `lattice` — Integration interfaces (20000-24000)
- `chain` — Primary developmental paths (30000-35000)
- `planetary` — Elemental bodies (X1100)
- `lunar` — Specialized systems under planets
- `comet` — Major operational supplements (Intelligence Chain)
- `asteroid` — Sub-specializations under comets
- `satellite` — Granular details under lunars
- `ring` — Transcendence meta-layer (35100)

**Assessment**: ✅ **EXCELLENT AND APPROPRIATE**

The naming convention:
1. **Hierarchical Clarity**: File name indicates cosmological position immediately
2. **Navigational Support**: Can locate artifact in hierarchy from name alone
3. **Metadata Rich**: Contains number, level, parent chain/planet, version
4. **Semantic Meaning**: Comet/asteroid metaphor for Intelligence Chain appropriate (transient, technology-dependent)
5. **Consistent Application**: Pattern applied uniformly across corpus

**No Changes Recommended**: Current naming convention is publication-ready and supports navigation effectively.

### C. Supplement Naming

**Pattern**: `CANON-[NUMBER]-supplement-[DESCRIPTIVE_NAME].md`

Examples:
- `CANON-00006-supplement-CONTENT_PRODUCTION_PROTOCOL.md`
- `CANON-31110-supplement-ACUMEN_IIC_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

**Assessment**: ✅ **APPROPRIATE**

Supplements clearly marked, tied to parent artifact, descriptive names.

## VII. COSMOLOGICAL PLACEMENT REVIEW

### A. Cosmos Level (00000-00009): ✅ **PERFECT**

All documents correctly positioned as meta-systemic governance layer:
- Navigation (Schema)
- Philosophy (Syncrescendence)
- Self-Documentation (Corpus)
- Falsification (Evaluation)
- Tension Navigation (Resolutions)
- Strategic Vision (Strategy)
- Daily Practice (Operations)
- Contribution Standards (Artifact Production)
- Technology Timeline (Modal Sequence)
- Entry Point (Quickstart)

**Rationale**: These documents govern and orient the entire system. Correct positioning above the cosmology proper.

### B. Core Level (10000-11000): ✅ **APPROPRIATE**

- CANON-10000 (Celestial Body): Generative core definition
- CANON-11000 (Facets): Reserved for future development

**Rationale**: Core as central engine, generative source. Proper positioning.

### C. Lattice Level (20000-24000): ✅ **APPROPRIATE**

Integration interfaces operating between chains and planets:
- Cognitive Palace (substrate architecture)
- Chain Interdependency (cross-chain mapping)
- Tri-Helical Timeline (temporal coordination)
- Interference Pattern (resonance)
- Lunar Navigation (degree progression)
- Priority-5-Omni-Quality (signal qualification)

**Rationale**: Lattice as connective tissue between major structures. Proper positioning.

### D. Chain Level (30000-35000): ✅ **APPROPRIATE**

Six primary developmental chains:
- 30000: Intelligence (Technology/AI)
- 31000: Information (Sensing/Perception)
- 32000: Insight (Coherence/Meaning)

- 32100: Coherence (Water/Meaning)
- 33100: Efficacy (Fire/Intention)
- 34100: Mastery (Earth/Embodiment)
- 35100: Transcendence (Quintessence/Harmony)

**Rationale**: Planetary bodies as elemental manifestations of chains. Proper positioning under their parent chains.

### F. Lunar Level: ⚠️ **EXCELLENT WITH ONE QUESTION**

**Generally Appropriate**: Lunar systems as specialized functions orbiting planets

**Under Information/Acumen** (31110-31143):
- Feedcraft ✅
- Tone Library ✅
- **Seven-Layer Stack ⚠️** — See Section III analysis
- IIC Constellation ✅ (depends on Stack)
