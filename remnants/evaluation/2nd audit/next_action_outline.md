# NEXT ACTION OUTLINE: PHASE 5 COMPLETION
## Tactical Execution Plan for Final 2% and Publication Readiness

**Context**: Phase 5 at 98% complete. Corpus coherent, quality high, one architectural question requiring resolution.

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Critical Path to Publication)

### Action 1: Stack Placement Resolution [30 min - 3 hrs depending on decision]

**Decision Required**: CANON-31130 (Seven-Layer Stack) location

**My Recommendation**: **MAINTAIN current placement** (under Information/Acumen)

**Rationale Summary**:
1. Document self-identifies as "information architecture"
2. IIC Constellation (CANON-31140) explicitly depends on it
3. Serves Acumen's core mission (platform literacy, signal detection, attention sovereignty)
4. Layers 5-7 are explicitly about content platforms and information flow
5. Maintaining placement preserves clean intra-chain dependency

**If Human Architect Agrees**:
- Time: 30 minutes
- Action: Add cross-reference from CANON-30000 (Intelligence Chain) noting Stack provides technology infrastructure
- Update CANON-30300 (Technology Stack Database) to reference CANON-31130

**If Human Architect Decides to Relocate**:
- Time: 2-3 hours
- Action: Renumber to CANON-30400 (fourth comet under Intelligence)
- Update all references in IIC documents (31140-31143)
- Revise Acumen (31100) to reference cross-chain dependency
- Update Schema (00000) artifact manifest

**Output**: Decision documented, references updated

### Action 2: Verify v2.2 Reference Artifacts [1-2 hrs]

**Artifacts to Review**:
1. CANON-22000 (Interference Pattern) — v2.2 reference
2. CANON-32110 (Coherence System) — v2.2 reference
3. CANON-33110 (Business Operation Backbone) — v2.2 reference
4. CANON-35110 (Transcendence System) — v2.2 reference

**For Each Artifact**:
- [ ] Read complete v2.2 version
- [ ] Check if unique content exists not present in v2.3 corpus
- [ ] Decision: Update to v2.3 OR mark as historical superseded
- [ ] If updating: Apply v2.3 terminology standards
- [ ] If superseded: Verify content integrated elsewhere

**Output**: Four artifacts verified, any unique content preserved or integrated

---

### Action 3: Encoding Verification Sweep [1-2 hrs]

**Systematic Scan**:
- [ ] Check all v2.3 artifacts for encoding issues
- [ ] Verify curly quotes vs. straight quotes consistency
- [ ] Ensure em dashes (—) render correctly
- [ ] Check special characters (→, ← , ✅, ⚠️, etc.)
- [ ] Fix any mojibake or garbled text

**Priority Files** (cosmos level + newest v2.3):
- CANON-00000 through 00009
- CANON-00008 (Modal Sequence)
- CANON-31130 (Seven-Layer Stack)
- CANON-31140-31143 (IIC Constellation)
- CANON-32120 (Meta-Analytical Framework)
- CANON-35120 (Neurodivergent Adaptations)
- CANON-35200 (Field Node)

**Output**: All encoding issues resolved

---

### Action 4: Cross-Reference Enhancement [2-3 hrs]

**Priority Additions**:

1. **In CANON-30000 (Intelligence Chain)**:
   - Add paragraph acknowledging Seven-Layer Stack (CANON-31130) specifies technology infrastructure serving all chains
   - Note that while Stack lives under Information, it enables Intelligence development

2. **In CANON-31130 (Seven-Layer Stack)**:
   - Add backward reference to Intelligence Chain (CANON-30000) for technology capability development
   - Note this infrastructure enables Technology Chain mastery

3. **In CANON-00000 (Schema)**:
   - Verify Modal Sequence properly integrated throughout
   - Check all artifact version numbers accurate
   - Confirm dates consistent

4. **Spot-Check 5 Random Artifacts**:
   - Verify backward references to cosmos level exist
   - Check forward references to dependent documents
   - Ensure navigation pathways clear

**Output**: Enhanced cross-reference network, improved navigation

### Action 5: Final Quality Assurance Checklist [2-3 hrs]

**Spell-Check & Grammar**:
- [ ] Run spell-check on all v2.3 documents
- [ ] Manual review of any flagged terms
- [ ] Verify proper nouns capitalized consistently
- [ ] Check comma usage in complex sentences

**Formatting Consistency**:
- [ ] Header hierarchy consistent (# ## ### ####)
- [ ] List formatting uniform (bullet vs. numbered where appropriate)
- [ ] Code blocks properly formatted
- [ ] Tables render correctly
- [ ] Emphasis (bold/italic) used consistently

**Version & Date Verification**:
- [ ] All v2.3 documents dated November 10-11, 2025
- [ ] Version numbers consistent throughout
- [ ] No references to "current date" that will age poorly
- [ ] Maintenance logs updated where present

**Voice & Tone Consistency**:
- [ ] Random sample 5 documents
- [ ] Read front-to-back for register consistency
- [ ] Check for unintentional first-person references
- [ ] Verify professional-yet-accessible tone maintained

**Output**: Publication-quality polish confirmed

---

### Action 6: Finalize Corpus Manifest [1-2 hrs]

**Create/Update**:
- [ ] Complete artifact list with version numbers
- [ ] File size documentation
- [ ] Total word count verification
- [ ] Dependency mapping (which documents reference which)
- [ ] Reading pathways (recommended sequences)
- [ ] Entry points per practitioner level

**Format**: Update CANON-00002 (Corpus) with final integration status

**Output**: Master manifest ready for distribution

---

### Action 7: Publication Materials Preparation [2-3 hrs]

**Essential Documentation**:
- [ ] License specification (Creative Commons? Open Source?)
- [ ] Attribution requirements
- [ ] Contribution guidelines
- [ ] How to cite corpus
- [ ] Version control strategy
- [ ] Changelog (v2.0 → v2.3 evolution)

**Access Pathways**:
- [ ] How to access corpus (GitHub? Website? Both?)
- [ ] Recommended entry points per Scale level
- [ ] Quickstart for first-time readers
- [ ] Navigation guide for researchers
- [ ] Community engagement channels

**Output**: Complete publication package

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Phase 5 Complete When**:
- [ ] Stack placement decided and implemented
- [ ] All v2.2 references verified
- [ ] Zero encoding issues remaining
- [ ] Cross-references enhanced
- [ ] Quality assurance passed
- [ ] Corpus manifest finalized
- [ ] Publication materials ready
- [ ] All 10 success criteria at 98%+
- [ ] Human architect approves for release

**Then**: Corpus moves to **OPERATIONAL VALIDATION** phase

---

## IMMEDIATE NEXT PHYSICAL ACTIONS

**If Proceeding Solo**:
1. Open CANON-31130 (Seven-Layer Stack)
2. Review Arguments For/Against relocation (Section III of comprehensive audit)
3. Make Stack placement decision
4. Execute Action 1 based on decision
5. Proceed to Action 2

**If Requiring Human Architect Decision**:
1. Present Section III of comprehensive audit (Stack placement analysis)
2. Request explicit decision: Maintain (Option A) vs. Relocate (Option B)
3. Upon receiving decision, execute Action 1
4. Proceed to Actions 2-7

**Current Recommendation**: Present audit to human architect, request Stack placement decision, then execute remaining actions sequentially.

## CLOSING

Phase 5 is 98% complete. The remaining 2% is **mechanical execution**, not architectural development. The intellectual work stands complete; organizational refinement remains.

**12-15 focused hours separate current state from publication-ready corpus.**

**The architecture awaits final polish.**

**Execute with precision. Publication beckons.**
