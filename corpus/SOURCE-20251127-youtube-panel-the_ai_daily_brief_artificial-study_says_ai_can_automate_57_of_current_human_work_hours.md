## Description (no transcript available)

Anthropic and McKinsey research quantifies how AI agents and conversational models can automate and augment work while mapping task-level impacts across occupations. Anthropic reports median task time savings near 80% with wide variation by occupation, and McKinsey finds 57% of US work hours automatable with up to $2.9 trillion in annual value. Implications include redesigned workflows for human–AI hybrid teams, surging demand for AI fluency and evolving skills, and new human bottlenecks in coordination and supervision potentially constraining productivity gains.
