## Description (no transcript available)

Why Was Early Human Life So Short? | History for Sleep

For most of human history, early human life was short—and not because our bodies failed too soon. In this episode of History for Sleep, we explore why a short lifespan was once the normal human condition, and how biology, environment, and evolution shaped what it meant to live a “complete” life thousands of years ago.

This long-form sleep audio examines why early human life expectancy was low by modern standards, tracing evidence from anthropology, evolutionary biology, archaeology, and population history. We look at childbirth mortality, childhood survival rates, environmental instability, hunger, injury, disease, and the evolutionary logic that prioritizes reproduction over longevity. Research from paleodemography shows that while some early humans reached old age, high infant and child mortality dramatically lowered average lifespan. Evolutionary theory explains why aging was never strongly selected against, and archaeological evidence reveals how social care slowly began to extend life long before modern medicine. Together, these lines of evidence reveal that early human life was not “cut short,” but lived within very different expectations of time.

If you find calm, evidence-based explorations of human history helpful for reflection or sleep, consider subscribing to the channel. New long-form episodes explore humanity’s past with a slow, steady pace designed for quiet listening.
