What's really happening with AI and spreadsheets? The common story is that foundation models competing on benchmarks is the main event—but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on how Claude in Excel changes what knowledge work actually means:

 • Why Anthropic embedded Opus 4.5 directly inside Microsoft's 40-year-old software
 • How data partnerships with Moody's, S&P, and FactSet create moats benchmarks can't match
 • What Norway's sovereign wealth fund learned from 213,000 hours saved
 • Where the model race ends and workflow integration begins

For operators and builders, the strategic question has shifted—it's no longer who trains the best model, but who controls the workflows where real decisions happen.
