What's really happening with your data on platforms like LinkedIn? The common story is that the platform knows best how to show you your own network — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on how AI breaks the data asymmetry that's defined platform relationships for 20 years:

 • Why LinkedIn shows you a filtered view optimized for their metrics
 • How relationship half-life models reveal which connections are decaying
 • What vouch scores predict about who would actually advocate for you
 • How warm path discovery maps your bridge to any target company

For as long as we've used digital platforms, they've held your data and shown you their interpretation. The questions their interfaces answer are questions that serve their interests — not yours. That arrangement is now optional. Export your data, feed it to AI, and ask whatever questions actually matter to you.

For professionals navigating the job market, this represents the first genuine shift in power from platforms to individuals.
