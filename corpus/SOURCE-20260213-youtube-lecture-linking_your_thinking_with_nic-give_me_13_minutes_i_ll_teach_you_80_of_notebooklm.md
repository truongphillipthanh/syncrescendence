If you've been meaning to try out Google’s NotebookLM but haven't yet, in this video, I'll help you get caught up and teach you everything about it you need to know. 

Try NotebookLM: https://notebooklm.google/

NotebookLM will help you process and make sense of information you already have - whether that's research papers, meeting notes, or hours of video content - and other apps can't process the information because of limits on how much you can upload. It's a super-powered, personal research assistant that only knows what you teach it. Investigate existing sources and get answers with fewer hallucinations, drawn from information you trust, BEFORE taking it elsewhere into your own personal notes or projects.

I'm Nick Milo, and I help you create a digital home for your best thinking – a personal Ideaverse of your notes and insights - no matter the app or ecosystem.
