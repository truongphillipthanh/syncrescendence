## Description (no transcript available)

Daniel Litt is a professor of mathematics at the University of Toronto. He has been a careful observer of AI’s progress toward accelerating mathematical discovery, sometimes skeptical and sometimes enthusiastic. 

Topics we cover: the hardest problems models can solve today, whether there is convincing evidence that AI is speeding up math research, and what’s missing before AI might have a shot at solving Millennium Prize problems.

We also discuss how to measure progress in math, including Epoch AI’s new FrontierMath: Open Problems benchmark which evaluates models on meaningful unsolved math research problems.
