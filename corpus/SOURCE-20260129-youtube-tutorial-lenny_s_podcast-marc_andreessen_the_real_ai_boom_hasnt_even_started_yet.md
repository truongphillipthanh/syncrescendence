Marc Andreessen is a founder, investor, and co-founder of Netscape, as well as co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). In this conversation, we dig into why we’re living through a unique and one of the most incredible times in history, and what comes next.

*We discuss:*
1. Why AI is arriving at the perfect moment to counter demographic collapse and declining productivity
2. How Marc has raised his 10-year-old kid to thrive in an AI-driven world
3. What’s actually going to happen with AI and jobs (spoiler: he thinks the panic is “totally off base”)
4. The “Mexican standoff” that’s happening between product managers, designers, and engineers
5. Why you should still learn to code (even with AI)
6. How to develop an “E-shaped” career that combines multiple skills, with AI as a force multiplier
7. The career advice he keeps coming back to (“Don’t be fungible”)
8. How AI can democratize one-on-one tutoring, potentially transforming education
9. His media diet: X and old books, nothing in between
