What's really happening with AI in 2026 as the hype era ends?
The common story is that AI will keep dazzling us with flashy demos and benchmarks — but the reality is more complicated.
In this video, I share the inside scoop on why 2026 marks AI's shift from clever releases to systems that actually work:
- Why protocols and constraints now matter more than prompting alone
- How agentic workflows reduce entropy when LLMs are narrowly scoped
- What dual fluency means for AI careers and talent repricing
- Where robotics and generative UI unlock post-ChatGPT software futures

The teams that win in 2026 will be the ones who stop treating LLMs as magic content generators and start building composable, constrained systems with real verification loops — but only if they can hold technical depth and customer outcomes in one head.
