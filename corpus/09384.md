🦫 About me
I am a Senior Applied Scientist (basically, a blend of Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer) at Twitch/Amazon. Outside of my full-time job I'm a 1:1 career coach for people looking to break into the field, with a focus on those from non-traditional backgrounds. 

I’m also a Certified Personal Trainer, always busy with too many interests, and really, deeply happy with my life. I hope to be able to help others achieve these things, too.
