Ok this is cool - who built this?? I like that it returns headers with the token count:
content-type: text/markdown; charset=utf-8 x-markdown-tokens: 725
(Description: Embedded link preview showing markdown.new service with heading "Turn any URL into clean, AI-ready Markdown. Fast, free, and effortless. Just add markdown.new to the link." with markdown.new logo and subtitle "Markdown for Agents")

any time you need to give an agent a url this removes all the shitty html and just gives it the actual context it needs
less tokens, more accurate. we're enjoying $200/mo pricing right now but one day tokens are gonna need preserving!
