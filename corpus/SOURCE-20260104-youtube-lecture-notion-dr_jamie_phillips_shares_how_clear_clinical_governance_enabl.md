## Description (no transcript available)

💡 Dr. Jamie Phillips — a former military doctor and Chief Medical Officer at Updoc and Sonder — faced a common healthcare challenge: clinical governance was slowing down innovation instead of enabling it. To solve this, he built his clinical governance framework as a living document in Notion, transforming it from a bottleneck into a growth accelerator for telehealth teams.

With Notion's enterprise search, every team member can instantly find the protocols and procedures they need — no more digging through folders or waiting for approvals. And with Notion AI Agent, Dr. Phillips has made his medical expertise available to the entire organization on-demand — the Agent answers team questions about clinical governance in real-time, automates routine documentation, and offloads busy work so he can focus on what matters: changing lives and removing access blocks to care.
