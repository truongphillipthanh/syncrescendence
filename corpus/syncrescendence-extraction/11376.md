## MISSING (in digest but absent from v2)

- **ASIA Federation (name + constitution)** — source: CANON-0X — The term "ASIA Federation" (Antifragile Syncrescendent Intelligence Apparatus) with its federalist multi-agent governance model and inter-agent protocol appears in the digest but is not named or constituted in v2. v2 covers Constellation agents but not the ASIA governance frame.
- **Two-Stream Architecture (Alpha/Beta developmental pathways)** — source: CANON-0X — Two distinct practitioner developmental pathways (not the Synchronization/Specialization tracks) are named in the digest as a distinct structural entity. v2 does not reference this.
- **Progressive Disclosure Architecture** — source: CANON-0X — Named as a distinct structural entity governing complexity graduation by practitioner tier. v2 does not name it (though CANON-23000's five dimensions imply it).
- **Sovereign Lattice (4-coordinate navigation system: Ontological/Teleological/Epistemological/Systematic)** — source: CANON-0X — Named explicitly in digest. Absent from v2 (not the σ₀-σ₇ strata — this is a separate navigational schema).
- **Foundational Tetrad (Pillar of Being/Purpose/Knowing/Form)** — source: CANON-0X — Named in digest as a distinct structural entity. Not present in v2.
- **Ontological Reckoning** — source: CANON-0X — Named conceptual entity. Not in v2.
- **Energy Coils** — source: CANON-0X — Named developmental energy state entity. Absent from v2.
- **Synthesis Principle (metabolism not eclecticism — influences digested not assembled)** — source: CANON-0X — Named principle. Absent from v2 as a named entity (metabolic language framing is present but the principle itself is not articulated).
- **Reconstructive Capacity / 80% Fidelity Test** — source: CANON-0X — Specific protocol for testing whether North Star can be reconstructed. Not present in v2.
- **Batch Production Protocol** — source: CANON-0X — Energy-state-aware content production workflow. Named in digest but absent from v2 (Alchemizing Catalyst covers content strategy but not this specific WF).
- **Developmental Stages (Protostar → Main Sequence → Red Giant → Hypergiant)** — source: CANON-1X2X — Named four-stage stellar metaphor for individual development arc. v2 references "Hypergiant Stage 4" in §2.4 but does not name or define the full progression.
- **Face Fluency Assessment** — source: CANON-1X2X — Specific protocol for assessing ability to shift between ModusOperandi faces, detecting chronic dominance. Not in v2.
- **Vertical Integration Protocols (Daily Layer Check-In 5min, Weekly Seven-Layer Audit 20min)** — source: CANON-1X2X — Named operational protocols for Cognitive Palace. Not in v2.
- **Dimensional Coordinator Progression (Minimal → Ambient → Partnership → Mastery → Transcendence)** — source: CANON-1X2X — Five-stage progression for Cognitive Palace coordinator engagement. Not in v2.
- **Seven Cross-Layer Integration Matrices (81-87)** — source: CANON-1X2X — Named sub-system of Dimensional Coordinators. Not in v2.
- **IIC Memory Profiles per chain (Acumen=aggressive forgetting, Mastery=very low, etc.)** — source: CANON-1X2X — Chain-specific memory retention policies. Not in v2 (v2 names the Seven Strata but not per-chain profiles).
- **Three Horizons (Eternal/Canonical/Fluid)** — source: CANON-1X2X — Named temporal framework from CANON-25000. v2 names the Distillation Cascade but not the Three Horizons.
- **Oracle Pedigree Protocol** — source: CANON-1X2X — Named protocol from CANON-25100 (decision archaeology, verbatim words, 18-lens evaluation). Not in v2.
- **Synthesis Sequence phases (Foundation→Capability→Understanding→Integration Maturity)** — source: CANON-1X2X — Four-phase interference synthesis sequence from CANON-22000. Not in v2 (constructive/destructive interference is covered but not this progression).
- **Resonance Phenomenon (all chains Level 3+ → emergent coherence)** — source: CANON-1X2X — Named emergence property. Not in v2.
- **Macroscopic Narratives (15 narrative lens families for civilizational signal reading)** — source: CANON-0X (CANON-00015) — Named thematic cluster. v2 §5.4 references "Reflexive Epoch" from CANON-00015 but does not cover the 15 lens families.
- **Intellectual Lineage (13 primary tributaries)** — source: CANON-0X (CANON-00002/00016) — Named entity. Absent from v2.
- **Knowledge Taxonomy (5 axes) + Meaning Taxonomy (14 dimensions)** — source: CANON-0X (CANON-00016) — Two named ontological taxonomies. Not in v2.
- **30 irresolutions under active adjudication (CANON-00007)** — source: CANON-0X — Referenced as a structural governance feature. v2 does not acknowledge this.

## PARTIAL (mentioned but underrepresented in v2)

- **Cognitive Palace 7 vs 8 layers discrepancy** → v2 §1.4 note: acknowledged as "minor internal discrepancy" but leaves it unresolved; CANON-0X digest lists Layer 7 (Strategic Harmony) as canonical, CANON-1X2X also lists 7 layers (0-6). v2 correctly flags it but the correct resolution (which canon wins) is not adjudicated.
- **CANON-00007 Evaluation document (v3.0.0)** → v2 references irresolutions in §6.3 persistent gaps, but the 30 active irresolutions from CANON-00007 are not enumerated or cross-referenced.
- **Content Protocol / Artifact Protocol (CANON-00014, CANON-00011)** → v2 §5.2 covers Alchemizing Catalyst and platform sequencing but CANON-00014's full content production pipeline, Stage-specific rhythms, and weekly cross-IIC orchestration calendar are absent; CANON-00011's artifact lifecycle (MVA→Beta→Stable→Canonical) is named only implicitly via "Quality Tier System" in §1.2.
- **Three-Rail System (Life/Development/Demonstration)** → v2 §1.2: listed only as a STR entity example. No definition or operational detail.
- **Quickstart (CANON-00013)** → v2 §2.2 Cluster 2 mentions Forum-level operations. The Quickstart itself as an entry pathway document is not covered.
- **Adaptive Interface (CANON-20020, component 73)** → v2 §2.2 Cluster 4 mentions "87-component system" and Meta-Systems but does not name Adaptive Interface or its high-stress → growth-mode scaling logic.
- **Universal Resonance Field (CANON-20020, component 70)** → v2 §2.2 Cluster 4 mentions it by name but provides no definition or operational role.
- **Pattern Library (CANON-20020, component 71)** → same as URF — named in cluster reference but not defined.
- **IIC Constellation / Five Virtue Triads** → v2 §2.2 Cluster 9 names it but the five guiding virtue triads themselves are not enumerated.
- **Operational Status Gradient** → v2 §2.3: present but the per-file status spread for 1x/2x files (Memory/Platform = operational; most other 1x/2x = theoretical) is not specified.
- **Constellation Architecture / CLI-as-Foyer pattern** → v2 §4.2 covers agent model but CANON-25200's specific "CLI-as-foyer" coordination pattern is not named.

## VERDICT: GAPS-FOUND

v2 achieves strong coverage of the architectural spine (six chains, palace, modals, interference, tri-helix, memory strata, Palantir reconception, sovereign stack, strategic convergence). However, 24 concepts from the digests are fully absent from v2, concentrated in three areas: (1) named practice-layer protocols from CANON-0X (Reconstructive Capacity, Batch Production, Face Fluency, Vertical Integration Protocols), (2) Cognitive Palace sub-systems from CANON-1X2X (Coordinator Progression, Cross-Layer Matrices, IIC Memory Profiles, Three Horizons, Oracle Pedigree), and (3) named structural entities from CANON-0X that anchor the personal-identity frame (Sovereign Lattice, Foundational Tetrad, ASIA Federation constitution, Two-Stream Architecture, Intellectual Lineage). None are blocking to the Palantir reconception or strategic framing, but the absence of the personal-identity frame entities (Sovereign Lattice, Foundational Tetrad) and practice-layer protocols represents a real thinning of the ontological picture v2 is meant to serve.
