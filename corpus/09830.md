## Description (no transcript available)

Lovable CEO Anton Osika joins the AI Daily Brief to unpack how AI-assisted coding evolved from early GitHub experiments into load-bearing infrastructure inside companies, why 2025 marked the inflection point for vibe coding, and why 2026 will belong to builders who can think, plan, and ship with AI end to end. The conversation covers the shift from prototypes to production, how enterprises are rethinking workflows and SaaS, the rise of personal and ephemeral software, and what skills will actually matter as AI takes on more of the mechanics of building.
