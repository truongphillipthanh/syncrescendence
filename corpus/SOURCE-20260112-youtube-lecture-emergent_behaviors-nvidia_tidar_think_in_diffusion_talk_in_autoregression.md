The trade-off between speed and quality has always been the "holy grail" problem in Large Language Models (LLMs). While Standard Autoregression (AR) gives us high quality, it’s slow. Pure Diffusion is fast, but often lacks coherence. Enter TiDAR (Think in Diffusion, Talk in Autoregression).

In this video, we break down how NVIDIA’s latest hybrid approach utilizes the best of both worlds to maximize GPU efficiency on the H100 hardware. We’ll explore:

    🏎️ Why LLM decoding is currently "memory bound."

    🧠 How TiDAR drafts in parallel and verifies sequentially.

    📈 Why TiDAR models (1.5B & 8B) are crushing the speed-to-quality curve.

Whether you're an AI researcher, a developer, or just a tech enthusiast, TiDAR is a game-changer you need to know about! 💡
