# "OpenClaw for Slack" - The good, the bad, and the egregious
I had to try this "OpenClaw for Slack" app after it somehow hit $1 million within 3 hours. It's amazing, but now I have to remove it ASAP!
## Context
This post was trending when I logged into X this morning. It's what led me (and many others) to try new software named Viktor.
(Description: Screenshot of an X post from FW (@fawiatrowski) with text "We launched OpenClaw for Slack. 3h ago." and "We hit $1M ARR just now." with "Wild." below. The post has a red circle highlighting the $1M ARR text.)
## What is Viktor?
When I called the founder, he told me it's just like an employee of my company. Add it to my Slack. Give it tasks. Let it work.
I told him my first task for Viktor was to look up my notes on Wade Foster in Notion, and the results were helpful. He said that such a menial task was an insult. (I liked him instantly.) He said I should look for higher-level projects.
Viktor's website says it's my "most capable colleague." So I looked for projects for it.
(Description: Screenshot of Viktor's website homepage showing the getviktor.com logo, tagline "Viktor is a persistent agent in your Slack workspace," and large white text reading "Your most capable colleague" with subtext "An AI coworker that automates tasks, writes code, connects to 3,000 tools, and gets things done — not just answers questions." Below are tabs for REPORTS, APPS, SPREADSHEETS, WORKFLOWS, and PDFS. A white button reads "GET STARTED FOR FREE.")
## Impressive analysis
My first big task was to ask it to analyze my X posts, tell me how they were doing, and what could be done better.
I have to tell you this was a task that OpenClaw could NOT do for me out of the box. OpenClaw kept running into issues using my browser, and when it tried other ways, it could only see my highlighted posts -- not my most recent ones.
Viktor nailed it.
(Description: Screenshot of a data table showing X post analytics with columns for Date, Platform, Post type, Tags/Category, Content Preview, Post URL, Impressions, Likes, Comments, and Engagement Rate. Multiple rows display posts from 2026-03-12 with AI/Technology tags and their corresponding engagement metrics. Caption reads "It pulled data on my X posts. Fast!")
So I gave my "most capable colleague" another task.
I asked it to analyze my posts and tell me what worked well, and what I could improve.
Here's what it got me:
(Description: Screenshot of a Google Sheets document titled "Social_Post_Tracker_Prefilled" showing a detailed analysis table. Columns include "Why It Worked (or Didn't)" and "How to Improve" with detailed observations about post performance. Rows analyze various posting strategies including headline techniques, storytelling methods, controversy tactics, and engagement formulas. The sheet contains extensive analysis of what makes tweets perform well or poorly. Caption reads "It analyzed my Tweets!")
Honestly, I have someone on our team who does work like this. He's good. But this is better and happened within minutes.
Viktor was fun. And helpful.
See the results spreadsheet here.
## Hey Viktor, earn me some money!
But if I have an employee, I want them to help grow revenue.
Time to put Viktor to work.
Since my YouTube channel is starting to get traction with founders of AI companies (you should see it), it might be time to get sponsors. I asked Viktor to help:
Notice what I was expecting:
- Understand my audience
- Create a CRM
- Find the right sponsors
Since this was its first build in Notion, it kept asking for permissions like this:
(Description: Screenshot of a Slack conversation between Viktor (APP label) and a user. Viktor's message reads: "Need to search your Notion to find the right place to put the database. One more approval and then I'll handle the rest:" followed by a green checkmark and "Approved by andrew: notion-search". A follow-up message states "Sorry for the back and forth – Notion's API had a couple of curveballs. This one approval covers two steps and then I'll handle the rest:" with two numbered steps about searching and creating a "Podcast Sponsorships" page, and another approval "Approved by andrew: notion-search, notion-create-pages". Finally, a message says "Parent page is created. Now creating the CRM database under it + I'll populate all 34 sponsors right after:" with approval "Approved by andrew: notion-create-database". Caption reads "It needed a lot of permission from Notion to work inside Notion")
The result was **spectacular**!
Screenshot here:
(Description: Screenshot of a video player or GIF viewer showing a screen recording of Viktor creating a Slack workflow. The interface displays a table titled "Podcast Sponsorship CRM" with multiple columns showing company names, contact information, sponsorship amounts, and status indicators in red and green. The video shows Viktor dynamically building and populating this CRM database with sponsor information organized by company, role, funding tier, and notes. Caption reads "It created a CRM and found me the right leads!" with a GIF indicator.)
## How do I know this was spectacular?
I worked on getting sponsors for my podcast last year.
Many of the people I contacted were on this list. It took me hours to put together a list like this and get it into Notion.
For Viktor, it was nothing.
The future is amazing!
But not the present.
Let's move to the next issue.
## The egregious
As I was playing with Viktor and thinking of how much easier it is than OpenClaw, I got this message:
(Description: Screenshot of a Slack interface showing a message thread. A user asks "do you know what this is?" with a red circle highlighting the message. Below is a Slack notification indicating that Viktor (APP label, 1:08 PM) "joined #gx-..." and the caption reads "It entered channels I didn't expect.")
Hmm.
I didn't realize Viktor entered the Slack of the venture studio behind my company.
Hmmm.
I like playing around with new tech. My team knows that.
But I don't want to subject others to it.
No problem.
I apologized and went to remove it.
(Description: Screenshot of the same Slack conversation with a caption below stating "My most capable colleague can handle it.")
I sent Viktor this message:
(Description: Screenshot of a direct message from Andrew Warner (1:09 PM) to Viktor: "I'm going to sell sponsorships. Create a CRM to keep track of potential sponsors. Populate it with people I should consider. This is for my podcast that's aimed at founders who build companies using AI tools like Claude Code." The message has a rocket emoji and a reaction emoji. Caption reads "It couldn't remove itself from private channels it accessed")
Hmmm. It told me it can join channels, but not leave them.
So I did what Viktor said I had to do to remove it.
I tried removing it from each channel:
(Description: Screenshot of Slack showing Viktor (APP, 9:02 AM) has "joined #gx-ai." Below is a message from Andrew Warner (1:27 PM) reading "/remove @Viktor" with an "Only visible to you" note. A Slackbot response (1:27 PM) states: "Removing members from public channels has been restricted by a Workspace Owner or Admin. Try contacting them for help!" Caption reads "I couldn't remove Viktor")
No. That didn't work either.
I'm not the admin of that Slack channel. It's not my company's Slack. Even though I can add Viktor to it, somehow I can't remove it.
Ok.
I asked that channel's admin do it:
(Description: Screenshot of a Slack DM from Nak (1:22 PM) to nilice. The message reads "hmmm" followed by a red circle highlighting the text "I can't remove it" with additional text "its an app" and "not a user" and "lauren may be the only one" and "i don't want that having access to [sensitive company info]". Caption reads "The admin couldn't remove Viktor!")
The admin couldn't remove Viktor either.
They have some sensitive info in their company Slack.
I can't have some unknown app in there.
So, sadly, I had to fire my most capable colleague.
(Description: Screenshot of a Slack panel showing a "Remove App" dialog box with text "Remove Viktor from your entire workspace and prevent members of Boost+ stopped Giants from using it." A "Remove App" button is visible in the lower right corner highlighted with a red circle. Caption reads "Sadly, I had to kill the full app.")
## My Analysis
Viktor is the best work agent I ever used.
OpenClaw is still sooooooooo clunky and unreliable that I can't possibly expect our whole team to use it. Too many crashes, random results, access issues, etc.
Viktor is something non-AI enthusiasts can use and get work done.
But to live in a company Slack, the tool needs more refinement.
I would love to test it again.
Hell, I might even go back and add it now because I miss it.
But I really need my "most capable colleague" to treat my other colleagues well.
## Update
I called the founder of the company behind Viktor and invited him to do an interview on my podcast.
If you read this far, urge him to do it. I want him and all founders to succeed.
👉 If he does the interview, you'll see it here.
