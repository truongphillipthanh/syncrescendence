![the skills masterclass promotional image](Description: Left side shows "the skills masterclass" in bold black text with "masterclass" highlighted in teal/green. Subtitle reads "5 workflows that run forever" in gray text with a horizontal teal underline.

## Overview

Every time I do a task more than once, I turn it into a skill.

I document it once, then my AI handles it forever.

Here's how I use the @openclaw Skills system to automate every recurring task in my business:

## What Are Skills?

Skills are reusable playbooks for recurring tasks.

Think of them like SOPs, but for your AI employee.

When a task comes up that matches a skill, your AI follows the playbook automatically. You don't have to prompt or remind it.

It just executes.

## The Problem Skills Solve

Most people use AI like this:

1. Have a recurring task
2. Open ChatGPT
3. Write a detailed prompt
4. Get a result
5. Next week: Do the exact same thing again

Instead of re-prompting the same task every single time, I found it much easier to turn those tasks into Skills.

---

## The Skills Approach

Instead of re-prompting, I document the process once:

1. Identify the recurring task
2. Write down every step
3. Turn it into a skill (a markdown file)
4. My AI follows it forever

Now when the task comes up: "Claire, run the X article skill for [topic]"

She follows the playbook. I review. Done.

## 5 Skills I Use Every Week

### 1. X Article Creation

**What it handles:** Research trending topics, create outline, write 700-1000 words in my voice, generate 7 headline options, create thumbnail.

**Before:** 3+ hours

**After:** 15 minutes to review and publish

**Example:** Last week I said "Write an X article about the Clawdbot masterclass." Claire researched, drafted, created headlines + thumbnails. I tweaked 2 paragraphs and published. 12 minutes total.

---

### 2. YouTube Video Promotion

**What it handles:** Pull key points from video, draft posts for LinkedIn, X, Instagram, and email newsletter.

**Before:** 45 minutes per video

**After:** 5 minutes to review drafts

**Example:** When I published the Ritesh Verma interview, Claire drafted all platform posts. I reviewed, made minor edits, scheduled. 8 minutes.

---

### 3. Podcast Guest Research

**What it handles:** Pull email thread, research YouTube channel (subs, views, style), find positioning, create prep brief with talking points.

**Before:** Last-minute Googling before calls

**After:** Full brief waiting every morning

**Example:** This morning's Cian call - Claire delivered a brief at 5am with his channel stats (7.79K subs), viral video (96K views), and collaboration context. Zero scrambling.

---

### 4. LinkedIn Connection Notes

**What it handles:** Research profile, find shared context, draft personalized note using my proven template.

**Before:** Generic messages, 20% acceptance

**After:** Personalized notes, 70%+ acceptance

---

### 5. Stripe Invoices

**What it handles:** Pull client info, draft invoice with correct line items, send for approval.

**Before:** 10 minutes digging through Stripe

**After:** 30 seconds

## How Skills Work

Each skill is a markdown file: `/clawd/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`

Inside, I describe:

1. When to use it - What triggers it?
2. What to do - Step-by-step process
3. What tools to use - APIs, commands
4. Output format - What "done" looks like

When a task comes up, Claire scans her skills library, finds the match, follows the playbook, delivers.

---

## Example: X Article Skill (Simplified)
```markdown
# X Article Creation Skill

## When to Use
User says "write an X article about [topic]"

## Process
1. Research trending content (Brave Search)
2. Create outline (Hook + Intro + Numbered list + Conclusion)
3. Write 700-1000 words in Corey's voice
4. Generate 5-7 headline options (proven patterns)
5. Create thumbnail (5:2 ratio, stacked cards)
6. Save to Google Docs

## Output
- Full article in Google Doc
- Headline options
- Thumbnail PNG
```

That's it. Now every time I say "write an X article," Claire follows this exact process.

---

## Why This Compounds

The secret sauce isn't one skill. It's the library of skills you build.

- **Month 1:** 2-3 skills
- **Month 3:** 10+ skills
- **Month 6:** 20+ skills

Each skill saves 30 minutes to 3 hours per execution.

10 skills × 2 uses per week = 20 tasks

20 tasks × 1 hour saved = 20 hours/week reclaimed

That's half a full-time job.

---

## How to Build Your First Skill

1. Pick a recurring task (social posts, emails, research)
2. Document every step you take
3. Create `/clawd/skills/[task-name]/SKILL.md`
4. Test it (ask your AI to run the skill)
5. Refine based on results

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too generic** - Be specific. Not "write a post," but "write a LinkedIn post in my voice using the insight-driven format."
2. **No examples** - Show your AI what "good" looks like.
3. **Building skills for one-off tasks** - Only build skills for recurring work.
4. **Not updating** - Your process evolves. Update the skills.

---

## The Result After 30 Days

**Before:**
- 3-4 hours/day on repetitive tasks
- Re-explained processes every time
- Managed tools, not a business

**After:**
- Claire handles 60%+ of recurring work
- 15 minutes reviewing vs. 3 hours creating
- My AI gets better every week

I don't prompt anymore. I assign.

## Final Thought

The difference between AI as a tool and AI as an employee?

Tools wait for instructions every time.

Employees learn the process once and run with it.

**Build skills. Build an employee.**
