# X Thread: Claude Code Verbose Mode Request

I wish this were a default setting. This is Claude Code, not Claude Cowork. I wanna see all the logs, don't hide them from me!

(Description: Screenshot of Claude documentation or terminal interface showing configuration instructions for verbose mode)

## Enable Verbose Mode

Run this to see full bash outputs:
```bash
claude config set -g verbose true
```

This globally enables showing complete command output instead of the truncated summaries.

## Increase Output Length

You can also set the environment variable to prevent truncation:
```bash
export BASH_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH=50000
```

Or add it to your shell config. **stackoverflow**
