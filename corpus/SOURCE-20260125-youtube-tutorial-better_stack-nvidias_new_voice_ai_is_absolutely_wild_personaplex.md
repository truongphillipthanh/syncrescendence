## Description (no transcript available)

NVIDIA just released PersonaPlex, an open-source AI voice model that can listen and speak at the same time with almost zero latency. In this video, we break down how full-duplex conversation works, why active listening matters, and what makes PersonaPlex feel more human than traditional voice assistants. We also walk through a full setup and demo so you can try it yourself and see how far real-time AI conversations have come.
