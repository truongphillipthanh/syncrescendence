# The Pattern Keeps Repeating: Claude Code & The Everything Agent

the pattern keeps repeating

claude code dropped and everyone filed it under "dev tools" for months. then people realised it was a general-purpose computer agent wearing a coding hat

codex just launched a proper desktop app. same energy. it's not a coding tool - it's an agent command center

parallel threads across projects. browser automation. skills library. 30-minute autonomous runs. the coding angle is just the entry point

if you're waiting for someone to explicitly announce "this is the everything agent" you're going to keep being late
