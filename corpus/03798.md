> To install Agent Zero, first install Docker by checking its version with `docker --version` and running the provided install script if not present. Then, create a Docker Compose file in your root directory, paste the contents from the GitHub gist, and modify the login/password, default model (Opus recommended), and API keys. Finally, save the file and run `docker compose up`.
