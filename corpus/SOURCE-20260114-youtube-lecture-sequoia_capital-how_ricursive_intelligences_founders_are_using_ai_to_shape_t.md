Anna Goldie and Azalia Mirhoseini created AlphaChip at Google, using AI to design four generations of TPUs and reducing chip floor planning from months to hours. They explain how chip design has become the critical bottleneck for AI progress -- a process that typically takes years and costs hundreds of millions of dollars. Now at Ricursive Intelligence, they're enabling an evolution of the industry from “fabless” to "designless," where any company can create custom silicon with Ricursive Intelligence. Their vision: recursive self-improvement where AI designs more powerful chips, and faster, accelerating AI itself.
