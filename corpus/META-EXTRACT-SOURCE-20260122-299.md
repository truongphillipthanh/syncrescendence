> A core failure in contemporary foreign-policy debates is the tendency to strip events of their historical context, treating today’s crises as isolated moments rather than the downstream effects of earlier decisions.

> Decisions that look decisive in the moment — an intervention, a show of force, a coercive move — can quietly undermine credibility, relationships, and deterrence years later.

> U.S. interventions in Latin America, taken for short-term advantage, often produced enduring strategic consequences such as weakened trust, regional backlash, and incentives for others to organise against American influence.

> U.S. influence after the Second World War was sustained by a maritime strategy anchored in alliances, trade routes, and shared security frameworks, rather than territorial expansion or continental domination.
