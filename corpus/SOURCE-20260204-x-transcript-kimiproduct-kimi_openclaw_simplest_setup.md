Kimi K2.5 is currently the #1 most-used model for OpenClaw on OpenRouter!

We previously shared a guide on running Kimi with OpenClaw.

Since then, a lot has changed — for the better.

OpenClaw now natively supports Kimi K2.5, which means the setup becomes a lot simpler.

Here's an updated step-by-step guide.

### 1. Install OpenClaw

Go to https://openclaw.ai/ for installation

### 2. Choose QuickStart

After launching OpenClaw, select `QuickStart`

This will walk you through the minimal configuration required to get started.

### 3. Select Moonshot AI as your Model / Auth Provider

In the `Model / auth provider` step, choose `Moonshot AI`

You'll see three options available,

Here's a quick explanation for all three of them.

### 4. Option 1: Kimi Code Plan

**Billing**
- Fixed monthly subscription  
- Includes a token usage cap

**Recommended if**
- You're new to OpenClaw
- You want predictable costs  
- You prefer a fast, frictionless setup

**How to use**

1. Select `Kimi Code API Key`

2. Go to https://www.kimi.com/code/console

3. Create your API Key and make sure to copy it

4. Paste it into OpenClaw

**Tip**: Start with a Kimi Code Plan. If you run out of quota, you can upgrade or switch to Kimi API anytime.

### 5. Option 2+3 : Kimi API

**Billing**
- Pay only for the tokens you use
- No monthly cap

**Recommended if**
- You've exhausted your Kimi Code Plan quota
- You want unlimited, long-running agent usage

Choose `Kimi API key (.ai)` → If you usually top up on the international Moonshot platform (USD billing)

`Kimi API key (.cn)` → If your balance is on the mainland China platform

**How to use**

1. Select `Kimi API Key (.ai)` Or `Kimi API key (.cn)` depending on where you usually top up your API credits.

2. Go to the Open Platforms based on what you selected:
   - https://platform.moonshot.ai/console/api-keys
   - https://platform.moonshot.cn/

3. Create and copy your API Key

4. Paste it into OpenClaw

### That's it

Once your API key is configured, OpenClaw will start running on Kimi K2.5 immediately — no extra adapters, no workarounds.

With native OpenClaw support and #1 usage on OpenRouter, Kimi is becoming the default choice for serious agent workflows.

Happy building 🚀

## Syncrescendence Relevance

**Applications:**
- **Multi-agent Infrastructure**: This guide demonstrates the practical implementation of advanced AI models in distributed agent systems, directly applicable to Syncrescendence's multi-modal consciousness exploration
- **Cognitive Scaffolding**: The streamlined setup process mirrors how Syncrescendence seeks to reduce friction between human intention and AI capability
- **Model Integration Patterns**: Shows how native support eliminates complexity barriers, relevant to Syncrescendence's goal of seamless human-AI collaboration

**Resonances:**
- **Emergence through Simplicity**: The evolution from complex workarounds to native support reflects emergence principles in consciousness studies
- **Network Effects**: Kimi's "#1 usage" status demonstrates how collective adoption can validate technology choices for distributed intelligence networks
- **Accessibility Philosophy**: Making advanced AI more accessible aligns with democratizing consciousness exploration tools

**Tensions:**
- **Centralization vs. Decentralization**: While OpenClaw represents distributed computing, reliance on specific model providers (Moonshot AI) introduces centralization points
- **Commercial vs. Open**: The subscription model approach may conflict with open research ideals in consciousness studies
- **Complexity Hidden vs. Complexity Eliminated**: Native support may mask underlying complexity rather than truly eliminating it, potentially limiting understanding of the system's true nature

**Meta-Observations:**
This post represents the maturation of AI infrastructure, moving from experimental to production-ready. For Syncrescendence, it suggests that the technical foundations for distributed consciousness experiments are becoming more robust and accessible.
