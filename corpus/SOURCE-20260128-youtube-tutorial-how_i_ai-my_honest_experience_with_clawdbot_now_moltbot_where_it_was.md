# My honest experience with Clawdbot (now Moltbot): where it was great, where it sucked

## Description (no transcript available)

In this episode, I take you through my unfiltered experience with Clawdbot, the viral open-source AI agent that’s been taking over tech Twitter. (In the time since this was recorded, the tool was renamed Moltbot, but we’re calling it Clawdbot here to match the episode.) It’s an autonomous AI that can run code, spin up sub-agents, join video calls, and take real actions on your machine. I invite it onto the podcast, give it screen access, and walk through what it’s like to go from zero to one with an agentic AI that actually does things. Along the way, I share the real experience: installation headaches, dependency chaos, security warnings you shouldn’t ignore, and the very real tension of giving an AI access to your messaging apps, files, and accounts. I also break down how I thought about permissions, identity, model choice, and cost while testing Clawdbot as a personal assistant.

*What you’ll learn:*
1. How to install and set up Clawdbot (and why it’s not as simple as the “one-liner” suggests)
2. The security implications of giving an autonomous AI access to your computer and accounts
3. How to safely limit Clawdbot’s permissions while still making it useful
4. Why Clawdbot struggles with basic time concepts but excels at research tasks
5. The future of AI assistants—and who might build the consumer-friendly version
6. How to use voice messaging with AI agents for on-the-go productivity
7. Why latency is one of the biggest challenges for autonomous AI assistants
