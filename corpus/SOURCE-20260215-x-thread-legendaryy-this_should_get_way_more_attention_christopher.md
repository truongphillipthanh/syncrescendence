Just built a Grok integration for OpenClaw.
Let your agents search X + use grok-search to pull real-time info. Powered by xAI. All you need is an xAI API key.
To install: clawhub install grok
https://clawhub.ai/castanley/grok
(Description: Screenshot showing the Grok skill integration interface with a purple chat bubble stating "You have a new skill called grok. Read it and tell me about it in a couple of sentences." followed by technical details: "Grok skill enables real-time web and X (Twitter) searches via xAI Grok API, with citations, domain/handle filters, and image/video understanding. Implements search_web/search_x via curl to /v1/responses endpoint using our API key.")
