# I've Never Seen a Tool Improve Team Communication Like This

## Opening Statement

What's wild about building at the frontier of AI is you're not just shipping product. You're discovering a new way of working.

## The Six-Month Experiment

For nearly 6 months, our growth team has been quietly using Video Agent, and our new V2, before anyone else had access.

No marketing. No launch fanfare. Just dogfooding the hell out of it. Every week. Without fail.

And what started as a side experiment has turned into one of the most transformative internal tools I've ever used.

## The Friday Update Framework

Every Friday, each member for the Growth team submits Agent videos that recap:

- What they worked on
- What shipped
- Where they saw traction
- What they're struggling with
- What needs feedback or eyes

## How Agent Works

It sounds simple. Async video updates. But it's not.

Because Agent doesn't just record you. It scripts you. Styles you. Edits you.

It lets people show up clearly and succinctly, in their own tone and words.

It adds motion, pacing, captions, and design. All automatically.

## The Result: Cross-Functional Alignment

The result?

A fully cross-functional growth org (38) — engineering, paid media, product, content, lifecycle, AI workflows, social — all sharing progress every week with the clarity of a creative director and the speed of a Slack message.

No more 30-minute calls just to stay in sync. No more guesswork about who owns what. No more "Did that ship yet?" "Who's working on this?" "What does that even mean?"

## More Than Efficiency: It's Human

It's not just more efficient.

It's more **human**.

You hear people's tone. You feel their momentum. You understand their thinking. Not just the tickets or dashboards.

And it creates something I've never really felt before in an async org:

**Emotional alignment.**

Because you see people. You hear what they're proud of. You feel what they're stuck on. You share in the story of what the team is building together.

And when you scale that across 30+ people, every week, for 6+ months…

You get a kind of collective momentum that's hard to describe but impossible to fake.

## My Favorite Meeting

This is my favorite meeting. **HANDS DOWN.**

No slides. No clickthroughs. Just people sharing the work that matters, in a medium that respects their time and attention.

## Beyond Recaps: Multiple Use Cases

We use Agent for more than just recaps:

- Narrating PRDs and walkthroughs
- Visualizing complex engineering systems for non-technical stakeholders
- Creating async onboarding and documentation for fast-moving teams
- Even exploring it as a creative layer for social and product content

And what I love is: none of this was "strategy."

It was just us using the tool. Week after week. Watching it shape how we operate.

## The Key Insight: A Modality Shift

It taught us something important:

**AI isn't just a productivity boost. It's a modality shift.**

The best teams won't just use AI tools. They'll **work differently** because of them.

They'll communicate in higher resolution.

They'll move faster without getting lost.

They'll build intuition across disciplines.

And they'll tell their stories **as they're building them,** not just after the launch.

## Acknowledgments

Huge gratitude to @kenchung who championed this workflow early and continues to hold us all accountable and to the @HeyGen Agent team for building something that feels like magic but functions like leverage.

## Looking Forward

We're not done.

This is just what it feels like to be in the middle of something new. When the tool stops being a demo and starts becoming your operating system.

More to come. Also - here's a 1-shot video... I was in a rush. Agent did it's job
