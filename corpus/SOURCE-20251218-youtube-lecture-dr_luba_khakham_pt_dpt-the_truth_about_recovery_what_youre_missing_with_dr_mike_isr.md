## Description (no transcript available)

Episode 20 — and our first-ever live recording!

Today I’m joined by Dr. Mike Israetel, co-founder of Renaissance Periodization (RP), PhD in Sport Physiology, and one of the most respected educators in strength training, hypertrophy, and recovery.

In this episode, we break down recovery from multiple angles — physical, psychological, and identity-driven — and explore how fatigue, stress, mindset, and training demands shape the way we heal and perform.

We cover:
• What recovery actually means
• Acute vs. chronic fatigue
• Sleep, stress, nutrition, and recovery
• Identity shifts during injury or setbacks
• Why rest is hard for so many people
• Tools to rebuild trust with your body

Whether you train hard, work in health or fitness, or are navigating burnout or injury, this conversation brings clarity to a topic most people misunderstand.
