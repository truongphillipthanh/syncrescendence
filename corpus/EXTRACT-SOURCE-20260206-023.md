## Analogy (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-023-0003
**Lines**: 42-44
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Modern warfare, like modern chess, has eliminated 'openings,' with conflicts often resembling a 'recitation' of actions leading to a foreordained position, rather than strategic development.

## Claim (5)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-023-0001
**Lines**: 20-23
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Elite play in modern chess involves years of memorizing computer lines, leading to a recitation of openings and middlegames to reach the endgame where actual play occurs.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-023-0002
**Lines**: 30-33
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Across various domains, there is a pervasive tendency to skip openings and middlegames, reasoning backward from a terminal state and treating intermediate steps as mere recitations.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-023-0004
**Lines**: 47-52
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.30, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The 'middlegame' in modern conflicts, such as the Donbas, still exists and is brutal, but our understanding of the struggle has changed, focusing on the performance of mass consequence without the risk.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-023-0005
**Lines**: 53-54
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.20

> Humans will constitute less than one percent of all intelligence in an AI-dominated future.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-023-0007
**Lines**: 67-69
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Simulation compresses whatever it can reach, pushing human effort to the edges where the position is still live.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-023-0006
**Lines**: 61-64
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Endgame play is a symptom of simulation, where the opening and middlegame phases are pre-computed, leading humans to focus on the un-simulated final stages.
