Jesse gets the vision better than anyone. Closing the gap between thought and action is exactly why we built this. Your support means the world. Let's keep killing the friction together.

Lemon spots high leverage tasks by analyzing your screen context instantly. Ask Lemon when on the screen or just in general and it will guide you.
