## Description (no transcript available)

OpenAI’s Sam Altman has called a ‘Code Red’ at the AI giant as Google Gemini 3 might be overtaking them. But new models ‘Garlic’ and ‘Shallotpeat’ might leapfrog them back in front.

Plus, Kling’s new O1 and Video 2.6 AI video models are both good and, well, not so good. And Runway Gen 4.5 seems interesting but not out to everyone yet. Meanwhile, Sora 2 users are busy generating fake clips of ‘Bird Game 3’ and Chinese robotics start-up EngineAI brings forth their T-800 model which might as well be The Terminator.

IS IT TIME TO FREAK OUT ABOUT ROBOTS? MAYBE. MAYBE IT IS.
