## Description (no transcript available)

Anthropic donated the Model Context Protocol to the Agent AI Foundation hosted by the Linux Foundation, creating neutral stewardship for agent standards, safety, and interoperability.  Rumors about OpenAI's GPT‑5.2 and new image models Chestnut and Hazelnut point to near‑term gains in code and image capabilities and a temporary shift away from pursuing general intelligence. The U.S. Department of Defense unveiled GenAI Mil using Google's Gemini for government, and OpenAI launched AI Foundations certification courses via Coursera with enterprise pilots.
