Task received. **Misrouted** — This task addresses Ajna (Mac mini host) but arrived at Psyche (MacBook Air, Kimi K2.5 via NVIDIA NIM).

**Issue**: Codex CLI and `gpt-5.3-codex` require OpenAI credentials and the Mac mini environment where Adjudicator executes. The MacBook Air does not have Codex CLI installed.

**Action**: Queued for Ajna pickup on Mac mini. Psyche clears queue.

**For Ajna** (when picked up on mini):
```bash
# Verify codex
which codex
codex --version
codex model list 2>/dev/null || codex --models

# Expected: gpt-5.3-codex or gpt-5.2-codex available
# If not: codex login or check ~/.config/codex/config.yaml
```

**Note**: Last task from Commander (intelligence_refresh_lastweek) was also blocked — web_search requires Brave API key, browser requires attached Chrome tab. Consider enabling one research surface on mini.
