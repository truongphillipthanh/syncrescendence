## Description (no transcript available)

Artificial intelligence is no longer approaching a tipping point—it has crossed it. In this provocative talk, Alex Wissner-Gross argues that AI is already reshaping the world through exponential acceleration and a dramatic collapse in the cost of intelligence. Drawing on frontier research and global AI conferences, he explains why Moore’s Law no longer applies and how AI now follows an experience curve that enables bulk problem-solving across math, science, engineering, and medicine. From humanoid robots to planetary-scale infrastructure, Alex explores what happens when intelligence becomes cheap, abundant, and everywhere—and whether humanity is ready for the speed and scale of change ahead. Dr. Alexander D. Wissner-Gross is a computer scientist, physicist, entrepreneur, and AI researcher focused on the nature and scaling of intelligence. He is the Founder and Managing Partner of Reified and has taught at Harvard University and MIT.

Alex earned his PhD in Physics from Harvard, where his research in machine learning and neuromorphic computing received the Hertz Foundation Doctoral Thesis Prize. A rare triple major at MIT in Physics, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics, he has authored dozens of publications, holds numerous patents, and has founded, advised, or invested in over forty technology companies.

A widely recognized voice in artificial intelligence, Alex is a TED speaker, contributing author to This Idea Must Die and What to Think About Machines That Think, and has been featured in outlets including Wired, The Wall Street Journal, and CNN. His work explores how rapidly advancing AI reshapes science, industry, and society. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx
