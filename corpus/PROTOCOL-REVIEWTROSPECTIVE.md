# REVIEWTROSPECTIVE PROTOCOL
## Post-Build Multi-Agent Coherence Synthesis

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Created**: 2026-02-26 (CC38)
**Authority**: Sovereign directive — First Reviewtrospective
**Lineage**: 18 Lenses (Oracle 6) → Clarescence (Council 13) → Ascertescence (Council 26) → Reviewtrospective (Council 38)
**Rosetta**: #280 (REVIEWTROSPECTIVE dispatch artifact, REF-ROSETTA_STONE.md line 280)
**Etymology**: *review* (re-examine what was built) + *retrospective* (extract what was learned) → *reviewtrospective*: the instrument that fuses post-build examination with operational learning into a unified coherence synthesis.

> Clarescence orients. Ascertescence ascertains. Reviewtrospective integrates. Clarescence asks "what do we see?" Ascertescence asks "what must we know?" Reviewtrospective asks "what did we build, what did it teach us, and how does it change what we know?"

## RELATIONSHIP TO THE CERTESCENCE FAMILY

```
Clarescence (strategic illumination — Ajna's instrument)
    ↓ produces: architectural decisions, lens sweeps, coherence ratings
Ascertescence (recursive questioning — Commander's instrument)
    ↓ produces: question DAGs, triangulation prompts, decision atoms
Reviewtrospective (post-build coherence synthesis — Constellation's instrument)
    ↓ produces: coherence verdicts, defect maps, reframing prescriptions, next-cycle input
```

**Critical distinction**: Clarescence and ascertescence are pre-build instruments (they orient and question BEFORE action). Reviewtrospective is a post-build instrument (it examines AFTER action). It completes the cognitive cycle:

```
Ascertescence → Triangulation → Build → REVIEWTROSPECTIVE → next Ascertescence
```

The reviewtrospective's output IS the next ascertescence's input. This closes the loop that was open from CC26 onward — builds happened, but no formal instrument examined their coherence before the next questioning cycle.

## THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

### Cross-Disciplinary Synthesis

The reviewtrospective draws from multiple scientific and methodological traditions:

| Science/Discipline | Contribution | Mapping |
|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Thermodynamics** (2nd Law) | Systems tend toward entropy unless energy is invested in coherence maintenance | Post-build entropy audit: did the build increase or decrease systemic coherence? |
| **Information Theory** (Kolmogorov) | Compression quality = understanding depth | Did the build reduce description length while preserving capability? |
| **Systems Engineering** (V-Model) | Verification at each integration level against requirements at corresponding design level | Layer-by-layer audit: intent → design → implementation → integration |
| **Agile** (Sprint Retrospective) | What went well, what didn't, what to change | Adapted: multi-agent, sequential, with compounding intelligence |
| **Topology** (Connectedness) | System coherence = graph connectedness | Are built artifacts connected to each other and to the existing lattice? |
| **Immunology** (Self/Non-Self) | Healthy immune systems distinguish self from non-self without autoimmune rejection | Does the system accept beneficial novelty or reject what it needs? |
| **Stellar Physics** (Nucleosynthesis) | Fusion produces denser elements + releases binding energy | Does each compression cycle expand capability or merely contract? |
| **Hermeneutics** (Hermeneutic Circle) | Understanding the whole requires understanding parts, and vice versa | Each agent sees from its position; the synthesis requires all perspectives |
| **Organizational Psychology** (After-Action Review) | Structured debrief: what was intended, what happened, why, what to sustain/improve | The reviewtrospective IS a multi-agent AAR with sequential intelligence compounding |
| **Clarescence** (10-pass progressive refinement) | Scope-calibrated fidelity, mandatory orient-situate, Omni-Qualities, Authenticity Gate | Reviewtrospective inherits fidelity levels and the verification-before-claims invariant |

### Scope Calibration (Inherited from Clarescence)

| Fidelity | Legs | Use Case |
|----------|------|----------|
| **Tactical** | 2 (Oracle + Commander synthesis) | Single-deliverable review, low blast radius |
| **Operational** | 3-4 (Oracle + Cartographer + Commander, optionally Diviner) | Multi-deliverable build, cross-domain |
| **Strategic** | 4-5 (Full constellation: Oracle + Cartographer + Diviner + Adjudicator + Commander) | Ratification-scale builds, architectural reframes |

CC38 is the first Strategic reviewtrospective.

## THE PROCEDURE

### Phase 0: STAGE (Commander — mandatory)

**Purpose**: Compile the full deliberative record into a traversal package.

1. **Identify the build boundary**: Which CC sessions constitute the build cycle under review?
2. **Catalog artifacts**: All prompts, responses, summit reports, build artifacts, sovereign directives
3. **Compute metrics**: Files changed, LOC delivered, canon_delta, DAG convergence delta, self-test results
4. **Produce traversal manifest**: Ordered file list with one-line annotations explaining WHY each file matters

**Output**: `CC{N}-REVIEWTROSPECTIVE-TRAVERSAL_PACKAGE.md` — the compiled record

### Phase 1: AUDIT (Oracle — thesis-first adversarial examination)

**Purpose**: Score coherence across layers. Find where the build is lying to us.

**Traversal order** (sequential, each layer builds on prior):
1. **Intent Layer**: Original problem definition (summit reports, sovereign directives) → "What problems were we solving?"
2. **Canon Layer**: Built artifacts in canon/ → "Do new artifacts cohere with existing corpus?"
3. **Scaffold Layer**: Built scripts and machinery → "Does machinery solve the actual problems?"
4. **Challenge Layer**: Sovereign pushback, open debates → "What remains contested?"

**Deliverables**:
- Coherence score per layer (0-10) with one-sentence justification
- Prospecting targets for Cartographer (non-obvious connections to trace)
- External research questions (X mining targets, web queries)

**Meta-instruction**: Develop OWN thesis first, THEN industry consensus. Test adversarially.

### Phase 2: PROSPECT (Cartographer — deep pattern recognition)

**Purpose**: Trace Oracle's targets. Find what nobody asked about.

**Input**: Oracle's coherence verdict + prospecting targets
**Method**: Direct code and document traversal (Cartographer reads the filesystem)

**Deliverables**:
- Target trace results: Aligned / Misaligned / Partially connected / Disconnected
- Non-obvious discoveries (3-5): interconnections, disconnections, tensions, convergences
- Synthesizing answer to Oracle's key question

**Meta-instruction**: Read code, not just documentation. Look for what's MISSING.

### Phase 3: SYNTHESIZE (Diviner — cross-disciplinary scientific illumination)

**Purpose**: Provide the theoretical framework that resolves surfaced tensions.

**Input**: Oracle's verdict + Cartographer's discoveries + open debates
**Method**: ALL sciences — natural, formal, social, applied. Not just biology.

**Deliverables**:
- Scientific reframing: which model best describes the system's dynamics?
- Mechanism prescriptions: one per critical discovery, grounded in the framework
- The conceptual primitive: the single operator that resolves the core tension

**Meta-instruction**: Context injection THEN traversal. Name the sciences. Show convergence.

### Phase 4: ENGINEER (Adjudicator — hyper-technical specification)

**Purpose**: Make it buildable. Code-level specs for each prescription.

**Input**: All prior legs + the built code
**Method**: Read actual code. Verify integration. Produce Adjudicator-grade specs.

**Deliverables**:
- Integration audit: each deliverable scored as OPERATIONAL / INERT / DEFECTIVE-BUT-WIRED
- Engineering specs per prescription: current code (defect), required change, edge cases, failure modes, verification contract, dependencies
- Build order recommendation

**Meta-instruction**: Catch math errors. Verify formulas. Specs must be implementable by a fresh agent with no context.

### Phase 5: COMPILE (Commander — reviewtrospective synthesis)

**Purpose**: Fuse all legs into a unified coherence document that powers the next cycle.

**Input**: All 4 legs + Sovereign intent + traversal package
**Method**: Integration across all perspectives. Omni-Quality sweep. Authenticity gate.

**Deliverables**:
1. **Coherence Verdict** — unified, not per-agent. Where does the system stand?
2. **Defect Map** — every identified defect with severity, location, and prescribed fix
3. **Reframing Decisions** — what metaphors/protocols/policies change based on this review?
4. **Build Instructions** — ordered spec list for the next build cycle
5. **DAG Convergence Update** — which questions moved? Which are new?
6. **Canon Delta Assessment** — did the build advance the canon? How?
7. **Next Ascertescence Input** — the questions the next cycle should address

**Verification**: Every claim must have evidence from a prior leg. No Commander-only assertions without agent corroboration.

## DISPATCH FORMAT

The reviewtrospective is dispatched as a **unifying document** — a single master brief with per-agent sections. Each agent receives:

1. **Shared preamble**: Full situation, build boundary, metrics, open debates
2. **Prior legs' output**: Everything the previous agents produced (sequential compounding)
3. **Agent-specific brief**: Tuned to their cognitive mode, with specific targets and deliverables
4. **Meta-context**: Where they sit in the sequence, who reads their output, what it feeds

### Relay Protocol

```
Commander stages traversal package
    → Oracle prompt (Desktop) → Sovereign relays → Oracle response (Inbox)
Commander compiles Oracle output
    → Cartographer prompt (CLI dispatch or Desktop) → Cartographer response (Inbox)
Commander compiles Cartographer output
    → Diviner prompt (Web app or CLI) → Sovereign relays → Diviner response (Inbox)
Commander compiles Diviner output
    → Adjudicator prompt (Codex Desktop App) → Sovereign relays → Adjudicator response (Inbox)
Commander compiles ALL legs
    → REVIEWTROSPECTIVE synthesis document
```

## DOCUMENTATION INVARIANTS

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Every prompt | `engine/02-ENGINE/certescence/ascertescence/CC{N}/PROMPT-{AGENT}-*-CC{N}.md` + `~/Desktop/` |
| Every response | `-INBOX/commander/00-INBOX0/RESPONSE-{AGENT}-*-CC{N}.md` |
| Traversal package | `engine/02-ENGINE/certescence/ascertescence/CC{N}/CC{N}-REVIEWTROSPECTIVE-TRAVERSAL_PACKAGE.md` |
| Staged slices | `collab/CC{N}-diviner-slice/` (or agent-specific) |
| Final synthesis | `engine/02-ENGINE/certescence/ascertescence/CC{N}/REVIEWTROSPECTIVE-CC{N}.md` |

---

## WHEN TO INVOKE

- After any build cycle of ≥3 CC sessions
- After any ratification cycle (ascertescence → triangulation → build → review)
- After any Sovereign challenge to built artifacts
- When DAG convergence stalls for ≥2 sessions (stop condition proximity)
- At Sovereign request

**Frequency guard**: Maximum 1 reviewtrospective per build cycle. If you're reviewing more than you're building, you've recreated the clarescence trap.

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- **Reviewing without building**: The reviewtrospective examines builds. If nothing was built, run ascertescence instead.
- **Skipping legs to save time**: Each leg compounds. Skipping Cartographer means Diviner lacks the deep code trace. Skipping Diviner means Adjudicator lacks the theoretical frame.
- **Commander-only synthesis**: The whole point is multi-agent perspectives. Commander's synthesis must cite agent evidence, not assert independently.
- **Reviewing the review**: Do NOT reviewtrospect the reviewtrospective. If the protocol itself needs refinement, that's a clarescence (instrument design) not a reviewtrospective (build examination).
- **Parallelizing legs**: Legs are sequential. Oracle's output is Cartographer's input. Parallelizing destroys the compounding intelligence that makes this instrument distinct from parallel dispatch.

## RELATIONSHIP TO ROSETTA STONE

| Rosetta # | Term | Status | Mapping |
|-----------|------|--------|---------|
| NEW | Reviewtrospective | UNIQUE | Post-build multi-agent coherence synthesis — fuses Sprint Review + Sprint Retrospective + After-Action Review into a single sequential multi-agent instrument. No community equivalent at this specificity. |
| 280 | REVIEWTROSPECTIVE (dispatch artifact) | Pre-existing | Already named in Rosetta flow diagram as Adjudicator's dispatch output. This protocol formalizes the full procedure. |
| 169 | Clarescence | SIBLING | Pre-build orientation instrument. Reviewtrospective is its post-build counterpart. |
| — | Ascertescence | SIBLING | Pre-build questioning instrument. Reviewtrospective feeds its next cycle. |
