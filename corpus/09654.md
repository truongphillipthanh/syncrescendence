Brand new GPT-5.2 was released just hours ago and I tested it not on standard known benchmarks, but on my personal logic test for causal reasoning. 

This test is my base test for a lot of other LLMs, from Gemini 3 Pro to the latest OPUS.

AT first impression, it seems to me, that the graph engine of 5.2 is blocking the complete solution path, if encountering a problem. 5.2 defines problems as pure roadblocks. THis would indicate that 5.2 move from a pure probability distribution (next token prediction)  to a restricted path on a graph. And there it encounters the roadblock, since now it is working on lower manifold. Interesting ... 

5.2 keeps the focus on this single graph traversal, unable to break free and find another path.  Can you write an instruction set to improve 5.2? Leave a comment.
