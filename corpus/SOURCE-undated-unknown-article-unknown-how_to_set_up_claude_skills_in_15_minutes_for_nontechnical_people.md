# How to Set Up Claude Skills in <15 Minutes (for Non-Technical People)

**Other**
if you're not using claude skills you're missing out.

they can seem intimidating but they're actually stupid simple to set up. here's how (images in the link below):

1/ make sure claude skills are enabled within settings > capabilities > skills

2/ turn on the "skill-creator" skill under skills within settings. this is the meta-skill that you use to have claude build other skills for you

3/ open a new chat window and ask claude to use the "skill-creator" skill to help you create a new skill

4/ describe the skill you want to create in detail, be specific about the output you need (you can also have an existing project be turned into a skill by asking the project to use "skill-creator" to turn the project into a skill)

5/ claude will probably ask some clarifying questions, then build out the complete skill file and a read-me document

6/ read the read-me document and download the skill file it creates. this tells you what it created and your next steps to get it working

7/ go back to settings > capabilities > skills > upload skills. select the file you downloaded and upload it. it'll add it to your skills list. make sure the toggle is on so you know it's live

8/ test it in a new chat by asking claude to use your skill by name

9/ if your skill isn't creating the output you need, go back to the conversation you created the skill in and tell it what you want to change (if you make an edit, you'll need to upload the new version of the skills file in settings & turn the old version off)

start with something simple (something you already do regularly already). you'll figure out the rest as you go.
