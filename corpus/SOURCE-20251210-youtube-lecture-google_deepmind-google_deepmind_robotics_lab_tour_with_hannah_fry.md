# Google DeepMind robotics lab tour with Hannah Fry

**Channel**: Google DeepMind
**Published**: 2025-12-10
**Duration**: 17m 44s

## Description (no transcript available)

In this episode, we open the archives on host Hannah Fry’s visit to our California robotics lab. Filmed earlier this year, Hannah interacts with a new set of robots—those that don't just see, but think, plan, and do. Watch as the team goes behind the scenes to test the limits of generalization, challenging robots to handle unseen objects autonomously.
