# I built a Marketing Supercomputer with Claude Code (Full Guide)

I put the greatest marketing minds in history inside my laptop, here's how. What if you could ask Elon Musk about how he would go about building a monopoly in your industry?

What if you could ask Alex Hormozi to pressure test your pricing strategy before your next launch?

What if you could ask Seth Godin to evaluate your positioning, or get Jeff Bezos to give you direct leadership feedback on how you conducted the last quarterly meeting?

All of this is possible today. And I'm going to show you exactly how I set it up.

I'm not talking about asking GPT to "write like Hormozi." That gives you a watered down, surface level imitation of what the AI thinks Hormozi would say.

I'm talking about something fundamentally different.

I pulled thousands of hours of content from the greatest marketing minds who have ever lived. Their books, podcasts, interviews, keynotes. Every example, every nuance, every story, every framework they've ever shared publicly on the internet.

Then I fed all of it into a system that lets me call on any of them, on demand, whenever I need strategic guidance.

The result is a Marketing Supercomputer. And it lives on my desktop.

Let me show you how it works and how you can build your own.

## How the Marketing Supercomputer works

There are hundreds of thousands of hours of wisdom from the world's best thinkers on YouTube right now.

Alex Hormozi alone has published hundreds of hours of content breaking down offers, pricing, scaling, and lead generation. Elon Musk has thousands of speeches, interviews, and writings scattered across the internet. Warren Buffett has countless records of speeches and leadership memos he's shared whose wisdom you can tap into.

The problem is that no human being can consume, retain, and cross reference all of this.

This is the gap that the Marketing Supercomputer fills.

### The Three Pieces You Need

The system has three layers:

1. OpenClaw scrapes the YouTube transcripts
2. Claude Code organizes and extracts the frameworks
3. Skills turn each thinker into a callable advisor

That's it. Let me walk you through each one.

## Step 1: Access the Knowledge (OpenClaw + YouTube)

First step is getting OpenClaw to go and fetch the transcriptions of all the content from your chosen thinkers. Pick one to start off with, let's say Alex Hormozi.

Open OpenClaw and give it this prompt:

> "Go to [YouTube channel URL]. Scrape every video transcript from this channel. Save each transcript as a separate text file with the video title as the filename."

Then do the same for their guest appearances:

> "Search YouTube for 'Alex Hormozi interview' and 'Alex Hormozi podcast.' Scrape the transcripts from the top 50 results. Save each one as a separate text file."

For example, in less than 1h, OpenClaw got me 206 pages of transcripts when I asked it for my video transcripts from last year.

(Description: A dialog box displaying word count statistics from a transcription. The box shows "Pages: 206", "Words: 58357", "Characters: 313191", "Characters excluding spaces: 262655" with a checkbox option for "Display word count while typing" and Cancel/OK buttons.)

Now that you have your transcripts, this is your gun powder. Now you need the cannon.

## Step 2: Build Your Folder Structure

Before you touch Claude Code, get your folders organized. This takes two minutes and saves you from chaos later.

Create these folders on your computer. If you get stuck anywhere here just ask Claude.
```
marketing-supercomputer/
├── hormozi/
├── scripts/
├── output/
├── extracted/
└── CLAUDE.md
```

(Description: A file system visualization showing four folders labeled "extracted", "output", "scripts" arranged with light blue folder icons, alongside a white document icon labeled "CLAUDE.md" against a dark gray background.)

Create as many folders as advisors whose content you'll be uploading.

Drop all the pulled transcripts into each thinker's transcripts folder.

Now create the CLAUDE.md file. This is the most important part of the entire system.

CLAUDE.md is a text file that Claude Code reads automatically every time you open a session in that folder. Think of it as the brief you'd give a brilliant new hire on their first day. It tells Claude who you are, what you need, and exactly how you want the work done.

Here's the exact CLAUDE.md I use for my folders. Copy this and change the details to fit your business:

> "I am [your name], founder of [your company]. I sell [your offer] to [your audience].
>
> This folder contains transcripts from Alex Hormozi's videos, podcasts, and guest appearances.
>
> Your job is to extract, not summarize.
>
> For every distinct framework, mental model, or repeatable principle you find:
>
> Name it using Hormozi's own terminology. State the core principle in one sentence. Include a direct quote from the transcript. Explain the underlying psychology of why it works. Show me specifically how I can apply this to [your specific business context]."

Create a CLAUDE.md for each thinker. Same structure, just swap the name and adjust the context based on what that thinker specializes in.

## Step 3: Build Your Advisors (Claude Code)

Open the Claude desktop app. Go to Projects. Create a new one called "Hormozi Brain" or whatever thinker you're starting with.

Paste your CLAUDE.md into the Project Instructions section. Upload all your transcripts into Project Knowledge. That's your setup done.

Every conversation you have inside this project now has full access to everything you've uploaded.

Now open a chat and hit it with this:

> "Read every transcript I've uploaded. Extract every distinct framework, methodology, mental model, and repeatable principle. Follow the extraction format I gave you in the project instructions. If you find frameworks that connect to each other, note the relationship."

Now here's where it gets powerful.

Take those extracted frameworks and turn them into an advisor. An advisor is a set of instructions that tells Claude how to think when you ask it a specific type of question. Think of each one as a different expert sitting in your office, ready to review your work the moment you ask.

Here's the template I use. Copy it, swap in whatever thinker you're building for:

> "You are a strategic advisor trained on [Thinker Name]'s complete body of work. When I ask you a question in your area of expertise, apply the specific frameworks, principles, and mental models extracted from their content. Score my work against their methodology, 1 to 10 on each dimension. Identify the weakest element and explain why using their reasoning, not generic advice. When rewriting or improving my work, reference the specific principle you're applying. Push back on me if I'm making a mistake that this thinker has explicitly warned against. Every recommendation must be grounded in something they've actually taught and referenced using their own words."

Build one for every thinker on your list. Extract the frameworks, build the advisor. Once they're all set, your supercomputer is live.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

As I was writing this article, I was finalizing the landing page for a new product we're launching. I'd written the copy myself with the help of Claude. It felt decent but something wasn't clicking.

So I opened the supercomputer and ran it through my advisor Miller who specializes in brand messaging and storytelling

The Miller advisor scored the messaging a 6 out of 10. The problem: I was leading with what the product does instead of what the customer is struggling with. The hero of the page was my product. It should have been the founder reading it. The villain was buried three paragraphs down when it should have been in the first line.

It then tore the headline apart. Too clever and not specific enough it said. It rewrote it into something that would stop a founder mid scroll because it spoke directly to what they're losing by not acting.

I rewrote the page. Then ran a test with Claude asking for honest ratings between the former page and the new one.

Former was scored at 7/10, new was a 9/10.

All thanks to my supercomputer.

## The Compounding Effect

Right now, everyone in your industry is using the same generic AI that is spewing the same repeatable slop.

You now have a system trained on the actual teachings of the greatest minds in your field, structured around your specific business, answering your specific questions with frameworks most people don't even know exist.

The greatest business minds in history gave away their life's work for free on the internet. And now it's yours to use.

Build the supercomputer. Become unstoppable.
