What's really happening with AI-powered software development? The common story is that vibe coding is a hustle opportunity or a threat to developers—but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why building software has stopped feeling like work and started feeling like play:

 • Why a Renaissance pet portrait app is doing $100K/month from a "wouldn't it be funny if" idea
 • How software is going through its Instagram moment as creation costs collapse
 • What software vision means and why some people notice software-shaped problems
 • Where the two failure modes trip up most new vibe coders

For builders and operators curious about this shift, the valuable skill isn't coding anymore—it's specification, and that gap closes faster than learning to program from scratch.
