Claude Bot (CLAWDBot) is blowing up on X right now, but there is a lot of confusion about what it actually is. It is not Claude Code; rather, it is an open-source application that lives on your local machine and acts as a proactive agent that can use Claude Code, Gemini 3, or other models to execute tasks across your entire system.

In this video, I break down the mechanics of Claude Bot—from how you communicate with it via messaging apps like Telegram to why I’m setting up a dedicated Mac Mini just to let it "run wild" safely. We discuss the power of proactive agents that don't just wait for your commands but actively look for ways to be helpful based on what they know about you.

I also issue a major warning regarding security and cost. Because Claude Bot has no guardrails and can run scheduled jobs autonomously, it can quickly rack up hundreds of dollars in token bills or even send unintended messages to your contacts. I share my plan for a live-feed setup this Wednesday and how I intend to integrate this into the Build Anything app.
