”Create an interactive accurate 3D scene from this sketch of a curved pavilion on top of a museum roof. The structure is an organic, flowing grid of steel with the shown intricate floral geometric cutouts. You must simulate Caustics: I need to see the bright, focused web of light patterns projected onto the concrete floor below, corresponding to the curve of the pavilion lattice above.

Add orbit controls for the time of day, season, and weather so the user can orbit around to see how light travels affects the shadows on the ground. Use a bright, hyperrealistic theme that is visually striking. Give this to me in an HTML file.”
