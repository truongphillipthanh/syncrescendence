We've seen mainstream adoption of Claude Code across non-eng in the last six weeks at @tryramp. 80% of PMs, 70% of compliance, 55% of the finance team. It's changed how I think about the role of the data team.
* **2021-2024:** analyst says "hey the numbers look off" in #helpdata, someone on the data team digs through code, troubleshoots, and pushes a PR. You could fill your entire day just doing this (and stakeholders were happy and grateful)!
* **2024-2025:** analyst says "hey the numbers look off" in #helpdata, someone on the data team copies the question into Claude Code, troubleshoots, and pushes a PR
* **Jan 2026:** the analysts start by using CC themselves, and show up to #helpdata with "hey, the numbers look off, I know why, and here's the line of code I think needs to change"
* **Feb 2026:** "This number looks off, here's why, here's a PR, just approve it"
AI tools are fundamentally changing what's possible for non-engineering roles. Our finance team ships SQL (shoutout Kate and Jun), our product team conducts causal analysis (Sam, Teddy), our design and engineering team build KPI dashboards. So what does this mean for the data profession, and the size of data teams?
The strongest data ICs are expanding what they are capable of, compressing timelines, shipping front end + back end code, fixing copy, writing SKILL.mds, and driving outcomes. If you are extremely resourceful and curious, have great taste for what matters to our customers, can source your own projects and ship anything in two days (or two hours) I can use 100 of you. You'll be more effective than you've ever been. Something something #jevonsparadox.
If you define yourself by your skillset "I do dbt models and dashboards "I do causal analysis" "I do data eng and Airflow DAGs", that scope and role is shrinking fast. The existing team can do more, and AI is competing your skillset out.
Paraphrasing @giansegato, we're progressively automating the easier parts of data jobs to agents, and the complexity and impact of the tasks we have left are increasing. The remaining work is HARD. It's creative and strategic. It's not siloed. It's knowing where to push, having conviction, leading and influencing teams.
I'm hiring for extremely entrepreneurial, curious people who want to do the most impactful work of their careers at Ramp. If that describes you, reach out.

The y-axis shows "Cumulative" values ranging from 0 to 700, and the x-axis shows dates. The chart indicates comparative daily request volumes across these two channels over a three-week period.)
