    gloss:
        Technology Chain functions as foundational element within interplanetary substrate infrastructure, distinct from planetary-specific chains while enabling operations universally.
end

PASS InterplanetarySubstrateEnablingAll:
    sutra: "Interplanetary substrate provides non-local intelligence amplification across all operational domains."
    gloss:
        @Interplanetary substrate enables Sensing (pattern recognition amplification), Coherence (framework exploration tools), Efficacy (decision quality improvement), Embodiment (skill learning acceleration), Transcendence (meta-cognitive operations). Operates continuously while requiring parallel cultivation as developmental chain.
end

PASS CelestialNavigation:
    sutra: "Intelligence Chain organizes within lattice tier with four comet-classified child elements."
    gloss:
        Parent: CANON-00000 (Syncrescendent Schema). Siblings: CANON-31000 (Information), CANON-32000 (Insight), CANON-33000 (Expertise), CANON-34000 (Knowledge), CANON-35000 (Wisdom).

    gloss:
        Practitioners engage to: develop @AI collaboration fluency across modalities; build @tool literacy and technological sovereignty; advance through four stages from text models to full integration; enable unprecedented capability through intelligence amplification; establish technological foundation supporting comprehensive development. In converging era (Fourth Turning + Fourth Industrial Revolution + Approaching Singularity), AI partnership determines viability.
end

PASS OntologyTheInterplanetarySubstrate:
    sutra: "Intelligence operates dual ontological function as both substrate infrastructure and developmental chain."
    gloss:
        DIMENSION 1—Foundational Substrate: operates non-locally across all four planetary bodies; amplifies existing human capacity exponentially (bicycle for mind); changes monthly requiring continuous adaptation; determines viability in converging era. DIMENSION 2—Developmental Trajectory: complete four-stage progression (Stage 1→2→3→4); requires intentional 3-6 months intensive practice; enables advanced capabilities at each stage; continues throughout entire practitioner journey.
end

PASS EssentialNatureTheSubstratechain:
    sutra: "Dual ontology requires Technology get double priority as both substrate and developmental chain."
    gloss:
        Technology Stage 1 = universal prerequisite for any other chain Stage 2 advancement. Practical implications: @Technology gets double priority (foundational + requires cultivation); begin Stage 1 immediately (Month 1)—all other chains blocked without it; maintain Technology advancement parallel to other chains; Technology lag creates compound friction across all domains. As substrate always active; as chain requires progression.
end

PASS PracticalImplicationsOfThe:
    sutra: "Substrate-chain duality establishes Technology advancement as priority equal to or exceeding all other domains."
    gloss:
        For Priority Sequencing: Technology Stage 1 = first course in all programs (3-6 months intensive); Technology practices continue throughout entire curriculum. For Dependency Logic: Technology Stage 1 = universal prerequisite; Stage 2+ enhances teaching capacity; Stage 3+ enables physical integration; cannot advance other chains while Technology remains Stage 0. For Assessment: check Technology Stage before advancing practitioners; Stage 1 incomplete = top priority remediation. For Curriculum: Technology advancement pace should match or exceed fastest-advancing chain.
end

PASS TheSubstratechainDistinction:
    sutra: "Substrate function operates continuously; chain function requires sequential four-stage progression."
    gloss:
        As Substrate (always active): enables Sensing (pattern recognition amplification), Coherence (framework exploration), Efficacy (decision quality), Embodiment (skill acceleration), Transcendence (meta-cognitive support). As Chain (requires progression): Stage 1 (text fluency, prompting mastery); Stage 2 (vision, multi-modal); Stage 3 (physical systems, embodiment); Stage 4 (universal fluency, ethical deployment, teaching). Synthesis: continuous substrate operation + simultaneous chain cultivation = not contradiction but dual function recognition.
end

PASS CommonConfusionResolved:
    sutra: "Technology development continues parallel to other chains; never 'completed' but always evolving."
    gloss:
        Misconception: Stage 1 completion allows focus solely on other chains. Reality: Technology Stage 1 enables other chains but Technology development must continue parallel; as other chains advance, Technology must advance too. Misconception: Technology is just a tool. Reality: Technology is BOTH tool (substrate) AND developmental domain (chain). Misconception: Can develop other chains first, add Technology later. Reality: Technology Stage 1 prerequisite for effective development in all other chains; attempting others without Technology creates predictable inefficiency.
