    gloss:
        Provides navigation tool (not belief system) for understanding and integrating worldviews across Syncrescendence. Serves as meta-architecture for knowledge organization supporting all chain developments from Information → Wisdom.
        
        Foundational to: CANON-31100 (Acumen), CANON-34100 (Mastery), CANON-35210 (Metahumanism), CANON-20000 (Palace), CANON-32100 (Coherence).
end

PASS CosmoslevelCoordinateSystemFor:
    sutra: "Four-coordinate lattice for locating any knowledge across ontological, teleological, epistemological, and systematic domains."
    gloss:
        @Sovereign Lattice coordinates:

        - Systematic: structural organization
        
        Enables mapping consciousness, institutions, practices, and knowledge across civilizational scales.
end

    sutra: "Substrate supporting all chain-specific developments as meta-architecture for organized knowledge navigation."
    gloss:
        NOT a belief system but operational coordinate system. Validates against all-tradition patterns. Supports development from Information → Wisdom. Enables cross-domain integration methodology.
end

PASS PartITheSovereign:
    sutra: "Knowledge as living architecture—dynamic crystallization organizing reality into cognizable form via four pillars and recursive nested structure."
    gloss:
        Core principle: Knowledge exists as @living architecture, not static collection. Organized by @Foundational Tetrad (four pillars reflecting single turning movement).
end
