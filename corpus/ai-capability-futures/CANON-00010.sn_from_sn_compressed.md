# Κ-00010: Syncrescendent Operations (SN)

PASS Canon00010SyncrescendentOperations:
    sutra: "Operational translation of Syncrescendent architecture into daily practice across six canonical dimensions"
    gloss:
        Core framework integrates Seven Pulses Protocol, Scope Domain operational allocation, Content Production Protocol (three-rail system), IIC daily practice, energy-aware protocols, and Stage-specific rhythms. Version 2.3 adds Modal-aligned strategy, repositions Scope Domain as operational (not canonical), integrates neurodivergent-informed practices. All practitioners operate across six orthogonal dimensions: @Scale [1-4 Micro/Meso/Macro/Meta], @Level [1-4 Initial/Intermediate/Advanced/Mastery per chain], @Degree [0-5 Latent/Recognition/Exploration/Commitment/Integration/Transmission—Lunar systems only], @Stage [1-5 Forum/Podium/Amphitheatre/Atrium/Portico], @Phase [Foundation/Validation/Scaling/Institute/Infrastructure], @Modal [1-4 Abstraction/Simulation/Embodiment/Transcendence]. Scale advancement optional; no hierarchy between scales. Level always requires chain specification. Degree exclusive to Lunar systems. Stage sequentially gated but independent from sophistication.
end

PROC OperationalPlaybookImplementationProtocols:
    sutra: "Systematic protocols translating architecture to actionable daily execution"
    gloss:
        Implementation requires energy-state-matched practice, honest capability measurement, transparent trending analysis, and burnout prevention as constitutional requirement. Framework serves practitioner; never extraction regardless of commitment. All operations constrained by actual energy capacity (Peak 70-100%, Baseline 40-70%, Depletion 20-40%, Crisis <20%). Scope Domain allocation tracks Life/Development/Demonstration time distribution. Production rhythms scale from Stage 1-Forum (10-30 min/day) through Stage 5-Portico (professional-intensity operations). IIC reconnaissance (30 min) and weekly synthesis (2 hours) integrate with Seven Pulses foundation. Monthly review and recalibration essential. Recovery protocols embedded: daily micro-recovery (15-30 min), weekly restoration (half-day), monthly deep recovery (full day), quarterly integration (2-3 days), annual sabbatical (1-2 weeks).
end

PASS FromArchitectureToDaily:
    sutra: "Bridging six-dimensional canonical structure to sustainable daily operations"
    gloss:
        Every practitioner simultaneously navigates Scale (cosmological sophistication level), Level (chain-specific depth), Degree (Lunar mastery progression), Stage (platform maturity), Phase (business development timeline), and Modal (technology progression). Orthogonality ensures Scale: 1-Micro practitioner can achieve Level: 4-Mastery in multiple chains while maintaining Stage: 3-Amphitheatre production without cosmological engagement. Phase progression tied to business maturity (Foundation 1-24 months through Infrastructure 97+ months). Modal Sequence strictly sequential: cannot skip modals; each modal develops necessary conditions for subsequent progression. Content strategy, production volume, platform focus, and capability development requirements shift systematically across Modal 1 (Abstraction, text dominance, 2024-2027) → Modal 2 (Simulation, visual dominance, 2027-2030) → Modal 3 (Embodiment, engineering, 2031-2036) → Modal 4 (Transcendence, infrastructure coordination, 2037+).

TERM DocumentOverview:
    sutra: "Operational playbook translating Syncrescendent architecture into daily practice"
    gloss:
        Version 2.3 completes operational integration: six orthogonal canonical dimensions provide taxonomy; Scope Domain Framework (Life/Development/Demonstration) provides operational time allocation; Seven Pulses Protocol provides daily health dashboard; Content Production Protocol provides three-rail system (Life non-public, Development semi-public, Demonstration fully public); IIC daily practice provides systematic intelligence curation; Energy-aware protocols provide universal neurodivergent-informed sustainability; Stage Development provides production rhythm matching platform maturity. Terminology authority: Scale (1-4 practitioner sophistication), Level (1-4 per-chain depth), Degree (0-5 Lunar only), Stage (1-5 platform maturity), Phase (Foundation/Validation/Scaling/Institute/Infrastructure business timeline), Modal (1-4 technology progression). Measurement: Seven Pulses baseline (7-21 daily points), trending analysis (monthly/quarterly/annual), teaching validation (minimum 10 documented sessions with student progression measurement), Modal falsification criteria (explicit success/failure indicators per modal with pivot contingencies).

Phase 3 content production planning (30-40 min): select 2-3 strongest synthesis opportunities, outline pieces, allocate production time. Phase 4 feed curation maintenance (10-15 min): assess source quality, prune low-signal, add promising new sources, rebalance architecture. @Monthly review & recalibration (4 hours, Development Domain): Prerequisites peak energy absolutely required. Comprehensive source audit (60-90 min), synthesis output review (60 min), capability assessment Level progression, strategic recalibration (30-40 min). Adjust curation strategy, reallocate attention, set content targets, ensure IIC remains energizing not depleting. Energy-state adaptations: Peak full routine, Baseline standard, Depletion minimal 10 min optional, Crisis complete pause zero guilt.
