## Description (no transcript available)

This eye-opening talk explores the dynamic landscape of artificial intelligence and it's implications for our future. In this engaging session, Roman uses the powerful analogy of surfing to illustrate how we can not only prepare for the waves of AI innovation but also thrive in the face of it. As the world rapidly evolves with advancing technologies, many individuals and organisations find themselves overwhelmed and apprehensive about the changes AI brings. Roman encourages us to shift our perspective from fear to empowerment. Roman is an expert in Digital Transformation. He combines his skills on the intersection of IT and business, lecturing at several universities and driving digital transformation in organisations across the globe. Beyond the boardroom, you'll find him on a different kind of board - windsurfing - out on the water, chasing the waves with the same energy he brings to every challenge. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx
