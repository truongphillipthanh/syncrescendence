PASS SyncrescendentCoreTheCentral:
    sutra: "Core is active generator—unified consciousness expanding through recursive amplification of planetary returns."
    gloss:
        @Syncrescendent Core (CON): Central energetic generator, not passive accumulator. Radiates continuously outward while absorbing refined energy coils from @planetary orbital motion, creating self-reinforcing system. @Recursive Amplification Architecture (CON) hypothesis: multi-domain integrated practice produces multiplicative rather than additive capability gains.
        
        Essential composition: foundational values (Reality Layer), integrative vision (Imaginality Layer), resource substrate (Potentiality Layer), rhythmic harmonics (Temporality Layer), operational methods (Practicality Layer), present awareness (Actuality Layer), accumulated wisdom (Consequentiality Layer).
        
        Radiation spectrum enables all planetary functions. Receptivity channels absorb refined planetary returns. System moves through spacetime as active development, not static state.
end

PASS EverexpandingHypergiantOfConsciousness:
    sutra: "Core expands from stellar formation toward hypergiant status through integrated practice and energy coil absorption."
    gloss:
        Development trajectory stages: (1) Protostar Formation (Months 1-6)—identity crystallization, Seven Pulses baseline, minimal amplification; (2) Main Sequence Stabilization (Months 6-24)—radiation patterns established, planetary development, energy coils generating measurable returns; (3) Red Giant Expansion (Years 2-5)—capability acceleration, advanced civilizations, synchronicity emergence; (4) Hypergiant Transcendence (Years 5+)—civilizational influence, second-generation teaching, framework transcendence.
        
        Expansion observable through radiation intensification, receptivity enhancement, integration capacity growth, synchronicity frequency increase, wisdom accumulation depth.
end

PASS CelestialNavigation:
    sutra: "Core occupies ⭐ Core orbital class; synthesizes CANON-11000 Syncrescendent Facets."
    gloss:
        Parent: CANON-00000 (Syncrescendent Schema). Child: CANON-11000 Facets—ModusOperandi. Operational status: partial. Refresh cadence: semi-annual.

    sutra: "Establish Core as living center of consciousness evolution; practitioners measure health, expansion, integration capacity."
    gloss:
        Core represents singular intelligence expressing through differentiated manifestations. Framework enables: unified intelligence formation, recursive capability growth, cross-domain coherence, experience-to-principle transformation, autonomous agency grounding. Individual scale advances into collective nervous system formation, civilization catalysis, evolution participation, field node emergence, transmission infrastructure.
end

PROC EpistemicStatusGuide:
    sutra: "Three epistemic claim types: EMPIRICAL (directly observable/testable), THEORETICAL (proposed mechanisms requiring validation), METAPHORICAL (organizing imagery, not literal)."
    gloss:
        Precondition: Distinguishing categories prevents premature skepticism or belief. Postconditon: Honest framework assessment.
        
        EMPIRICAL: Seven Pulses trackable daily; energy levels measurable observably. THEORETICAL: Recursive amplification creates synergistic breakthroughs; balanced development enhances integration (require longitudinal validation). METAPHORICAL: Core expands like hypergiant; energy coils propagate from planets (organizing scaffolding, not physical claims).
        
        Confusing categories leads to rejection or uncritical acceptance. Epistemic honesty marks what is known, proposed, and image-based.
end

PROC HowToReadThis:
    sutra: "Interpret framework components according to epistemic status; test theoretical claims against evidence."
    gloss:
        Step 1: Identify epistemic category of each claim. Step 2: Apply appropriate validation standard (empirical=observable evidence, theoretical=longitudinal study, metaphorical=organizing utility). Step 3: Maintain distinction preventing category confusion.
end

PASS WhyThisMatters:
    sutra: "Ontological honesty enables authentic development; confusing claim types produces either rejection or false confidence."
    gloss:
        Framework sophistication requires precision. Metaphorical scaffolding provides organizing structure; recursive amplification mechanism represents testable hypothesis; Seven Pulses enables measurement. Standing or falling on evidence, not assertion.
end

PASS OntologyWhatTheCore:
    sutra: "Core operates as active generator, radiator, spacetime mover, amplified receiver, and self-reinforcing system."
    gloss:
        Four operational characteristics: (1) [THEORETICAL+METAPHORICAL] Expands continuously—progression toward hypergiant through recursive amplification; each energy coil absorbed may accelerate expansion (metaphor for capability growth). (2) [EMPIRICAL] Radiates outward—consciousness energy emanates observably through active attention, engagement, measurable via Seven Pulses and capacity assessment. (3) [METAPHORICAL] Moves through spacetime—vivid imagery for dynamic development, not static state. (4) [THEORETICAL] Receives amplified return—planetary orbital motion generates energy coils propagating back; cross-domain practice creates synergistic enhancement (requires validation through comparative studies).
        
        @Recursive Amplification Architecture (CON): Core enables planets → planets generate coils → coils amplify Core → amplified Core enables advanced development. Central theoretical claim requiring longitudinal validation: integrated multi-domain practice produces multiplicative rather than additive gains.

    gloss:
        Requirement: Measurable validation across three timeframes. Shall implement baseline establishment (Months 1-3). Shall launch beta cohort (Months 4-6). Shall identify patterns (Months 7-12). Shall conduct rigorous assessment (Year 2). Shall report publicly (Year 3).
        
        Empirical Success Criteria (6-12 months): Seven Pulses improvement >20% over baseline; chain advancement velocity measurable and positive; integration quality demonstrable; energy stability increasing; external observer validation of reported transformation.
        
        Theoretical Validation (18-36 months): recursive amplification produces multiplicative vs. additive gains (comparative cohort studies); energy coils enhance Core capacity beyond baseline (before/after assessment); synchronization effects outperform isolation (comparative performance analysis); phase-locked coordination accelerates development (protocol comparison studies).
        
        Falsification conditions: Seven Pulses deteriorate despite adherence; multi-chain practitioners show no advantage; integration claims unsupported; energy coil null results; recursive amplification shows additive effects; framework produces no measurable benefit vs. control.
        
        Enforcement: commitment to honest reporting of all outcomes (positive, null, negative). Framework revision if validation fails. Evidence, not assertion, determines standing.
