Evaluation identified 15 tensions: 53% resolved, 20% architecturally addressed, 20% requiring further work, 7% productively held. Strategy synthesizes each resolution into cosmological components enabling simultaneous tension mitigation and consciousness evolution toward @omnibenevolence, @omniscience, @omnipotence, @omnipresence.
end

PASS MacroscopicResolutionStrategyArchitectural:
    sutra: "Master schema orthogonality establishing six independent dimensions enabling valid arbitrary combinations."
    gloss:
        Six @canonical dimensions define framework architecture:
        1. Scale [1-4]: Practitioner cosmological sophistication (Micro→Meso→Macro→Meta)
        2. Level [1-4]: Chain development progression (Initial→Intermediate→Advanced→Mastery)

end

NORM AStrategicPrinciples:
    sutra: "Three normative principles governing framework engagement across sophistication levels, developmental pace, and organizational phases."
    gloss:
        PRINCIPLE 1—Progressive Disclosure Architecture: Framework MUST serve beginners at Scale 1-Micro (Seven Pulses sufficient) without simplification and sophisticated practitioners at Scale 4-Meta without artificiality. MECHANISM: Optional advancement across scales (Micro→Meso→Macro→Meta) enables simultaneous accessibility and sophistication. ENFORCEMENT: Stage development (Forum→Podium→Amphitheatre→Atrium→Portico) scales reach while Scale progression scales cognitive demand.
        
        PRINCIPLE 2—Dual-Track Development: Practitioners SHALL advance independently through primary chain selected from {Intelligence, Information, Insight, Expertise, Knowledge, Wisdom} at individual pace while optionally integrating secondary chain and cosmological sophistication. MECHANISM: Level progression (1→2→3→4) per chain independent; integration optional after Level 2-Intermediate. ENFORCEMENT: Seven Pulses provide universal measurement enabling both individual tracking and systemic coherence without forced synchronization.
        
        PRINCIPLE 3—Phase-Appropriate Engagement: Operational demands MUST remain realistic at each Phase (Foundation: 40hrs/week; Validation: 50hrs/week; Scaling: 55hrs/week; Institute: 55hrs/week leveraged; Infrastructure: distributed). MECHANISM: Phased scaling of teaching (no teaching→pilot→multiple cohorts→peer network→distributed), operations (minimal→moderate→intensive→strategic→distributed), and revenue ($0→$2-5K→$10-30K→$50-100K→$100K+). ENFORCEMENT: Modal progression aligns content strategy with technology readiness (Modal 1 text dominance ~2024-27; Modal 2 visual emergence ~2027-30; Modal 3 physical construction ~2031-36; Modal 4 distributed intelligence ~2037+).

Scale 1-Micro serves complete novices; Scales 2-4 reveal progressive depth. Stage 1-Forum builds credibility; Stages 2-5 scale reach. RESOLUTION MECHANISM: Seven Pulses Protocol universal across all scales enables entry at any sophistication level without cognitive burden; optional progressive revelation permits depth without forced complexity.
        
        PATHWAY 2—Time Demand ↔ Phase Reality: @Phase dimension matches realistic organizational capacity. Foundation Phase (40hrs/week): 20hrs creation + 15hrs engagement + 5hrs operations; no teaching. Validation Phase (50hrs/week): 25hrs creation + 15hrs engagement + 10hrs operations; pilot cohort only (8-12 students).

Infrastructure Phase (distributed): strategic oversight + peer teacher network + distributed teaching.
        
        PATHWAY 3—Individual Development ↔ Systemic Coherence: Independent chain progression per practitioner permits uneven advancement while @seven pulses measurement provides systemic coherence. MECHANISM: Each chain develops independently (Level 1→2→3→4); integration optional; Strategic Harmony emerges from mature practitioners without forced synchronization.
