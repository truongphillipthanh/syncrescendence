In this video, we take a hands-on look at Clawdbot, testing its autonomous browser control and walking through a full LOCAL AI setup using LM Studio and GPT-OSS. The goal is to see how well Clawdbot performs when paired with a locally hosted model rather than a hosted API.

We begin with real-world testing, including browser automation, log analysis, and autonomous interaction, then move into a step-by-step tutorial covering Clawdbot configuration, LM Studio setup, context length considerations, browser tool configuration, and troubleshooting common performance issues.
