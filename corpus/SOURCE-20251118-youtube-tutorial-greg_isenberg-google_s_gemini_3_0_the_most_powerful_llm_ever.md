## Description (no transcript available)

Get a private, on-screen walkthrough of Google’s new Gemini 3.0 with Logan Kilpatrick from Google Deepmind. We vibe-code full apps, games, and product UIs in real time. You’ll see how to go from raw idea to working product in a single prompt, then iterate visually with design, features, and AI workflows. They turn an IdeaBrowser concept into a live talent-matching platform, screenshot-clone the IdeaBrowser UI, wire up a “generate tomorrow’s idea” feature grounded in Google Search, and even add co-founder matching on top. If you’re building with AI or still on the fence, this episode shows what’s now possible with Gemini 3.0 Pro in AI Studio.

*Key Points*

* Gemini 3.0 Pro in AI Studio lets you “vibe code” full apps—UI, logic, and AI features—from natural-language prompts, then iteratively refine them.
* Games and complex simulations are a stress-test and showcase for the model’s capabilities, not just toys.
* You can paste an entire business idea (like IdeaBrowser’s generational talent-matching concept) into AI Studio and get a working, multi-screen product with AI-powered workflows.
* Gemini 3.0 Pro is free to use inside AI Studio up to generous limits, and the API is priced at $2 per million input tokens and $12 per million output tokens under 200K input tokens.
* Screenshot-driven UI cloning plus “add five more features” prompts are powerful loops for product and UX ideation.
* You can layer social features like co-founder matching directly on top of idea-discovery products with only a few additional prompts.

Section Summaries

1) Why Gemini 3.0 Is an “Unfair Advantage”
Greg frames the episode as an inside look at Google’s new Gemini 3.0, promising listeners a practical “unfair advantage” in how to use it. Logan explains Gemini 3’s mission—helping you “bring anything to life,” from receipts and papers to app ideas—and outlines where it’s available: the Gemini app, AI Studio, and APIs for developers and enterprises. 

2) Vibe Coding Landing Pages and Games
Inside AI Studio’s vibe-coding experience, Logan shows that a single prompt can generate polished landing pages and immersive 3D games. They discuss games as both marketing assets (e.g., branded runners for companies) and as a proxy for the model’s sophistication, since game logic and UX are hard to build by hand. 

3) Turning an IdeaBrowser Concept into a Working App
Greg introduces an IdeaBrowser concept: a generational gap talent-matching platform pairing junior AI developers with senior industry veterans. Logan copies the idea’s full text into AI Studio and asks Gemini to “make it fully functional,” resulting in a live app with landing page, talent profiles, fit analysis, and an enterprise team-builder that evaluates roster balance. 

4) Debugging, Annotating, and Deploying Vibe-Coded Apps
As they explore, they hit common vibe-coding friction points: a mis-placed “Send” button and a blank preview due to missing files. Logan demonstrates the annotate tool (boxing UI elements and attaching instructions) and the simple fix of telling the model “the screen is white” so it regenerates the correct structure, then describes how you can deploy, share, and iterate on these apps with teammates or customers. 

5) Screenshot-Cloning IdeaBrowser and Generating Tomorrow’s Ideas
They screenshot IdeaBrowser’s UI and ask Gemini to “clone this UI exactly” while adding a “generate tomorrow’s idea” button grounded in Google Search. The model recreates a close visual match and builds a feature that pulls current AI governance trends to generate a new idea (“Ethos AI”) with positioning, offer, and starter kit concepts—showing how screenshots become launchpads for new verticals or geos.
