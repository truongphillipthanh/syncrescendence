In January 2026, Obsidian's CEO asked a simple question on X: how are you using Obsidian with Claude Code?                                                        
                                                                        
The responses revealed something bigger than a plugin trend—a shift in how we interact with computers.                                                          
                                                                                    
Your markdown notes are no longer passive storage. They're becoming instructions for AI to execute.
