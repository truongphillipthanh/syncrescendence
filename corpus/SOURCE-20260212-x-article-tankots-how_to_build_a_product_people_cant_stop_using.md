# How to build a product people can't stop using
(Description: Movie scene featuring four young men gathered around a laptop computer in what appears to be a basement or office setting with warm overhead lighting. They are intently focused on the screen. The aesthetic is cinematic with golden-toned lighting and suggests collaboration or problem-solving.)
99% of consumer products fail for the same reason.
It's one thing to build a product people will use, but it's another to build something people can't live without.
My most recent company (voice-to-text AI) recently reached **100,000+ concurrent daily active users** and over **10 billion words dictated**.
Building a successful consumer company is much more simple than you think.
We often hyper-fixate on the intricacies of specific areas (subtle design fixes or new marketing campaigns), but the real drivers of growth are much more obvious.
This article is meant to teach you everything I learned along the way.
## Context
Based on my experience, everything that actually moved the needle falls into three buckets:
- **Psychology** - understanding what makes someone use your product 100 times a day instead of once.
- **Product** - the invisible decisions that turn a demo into a dependency.
- **Team** - the people dynamics that let 5 people out-ship companies with 500.
Most startup advice over-indexes on one of these categories. In reality, they're three pillars of one system.
Here is the full playbook:
## I - Psychology
To build any successful product, you can't just engineer different use cases or make intricate designs for the user flow. You have to reverse engineer their behavior from the ground up.
Consumer products don't win on features. They win on feelings. And the gap between those two things is where most companies die.
The most important realization following this idea is this:
**You can only change one behavior at a time.**
This is the most expensive lesson in consumer.
Before Wispr Flow existed as software, we were building a hardware device - a wearable earpiece that could read neural signals from silent speech and turn them into text.
The hardware worked perfectly, and we could convert subvocalized thoughts into text.
But it required users to adopt two new behaviors simultaneously: wear a new device AND speak to their computer instead of typing.
Look at every failed hardware product in the last 5 years. The Humane AI Pin asked people to wear a new device AND interact with a projector on their palm. Google Glass asked people to wear a camera on their face AND talk to thin air in public. They were asking for two behavior changes at once.
(Description: Comparison diagram with two columns. Left column labeled "CALLED A SCAM" shows the Humane AI Pin with bullet points listing multiple required behavior changes. Right column labeled "NEAR ZERO ADOPTION" shows Google Glass with similar behavior requirements listed.)
If Humane had just made an app for contextual AI use, millions might have adopted it. Hardware should be an upgrade, not a leap of faith.
When we made Wispr Flow, we asked for exactly one behavior change: speak instead of type. Everything else - your apps, your workflow, your screen - stays identical.
Creating this seamless workflow explains why 90% of our growth is from word of mouth. It's not luck. That's the result of obsessing over one psychological moment and engineering everything around it.
(Description: Evolution diagram titled "WISPR EVOLUTION" showing three stages: Stage 0 (hardware wearable), Stage 0.5 (software - wispr flow with "behavior required" label), and Result (90% word of mouth with "organic growth" indicator). The progression illustrates the pivot from hardware to software and the resulting organic adoption.)
## II - Product
There were two key actions that enabled us to truly solve the user's problems.
### We talked to 500+ people.
Before Flow existed, I personally sat down with over 500 people to learn more about what they struggled with. Not surveys. Not Google Forms. Real conversations, watching people struggle with every dictation tool on the market, noting the exact moment frustration hit.
Most founders build what they think users want. But instead, those hundreds of conversations later, the patterns were undeniable. Every design decision in Flow traces back to something someone said in one of those conversations.
### A product that learns you
Besides the advanced dictation and AI models, we also built a product that learns directly what you're working on and your unique style of work. For most tools on the market, certain names or words are always misspelled. We made an effort to show we are constantly learning and improving so that doesn't happen again. Here are some examples of key features we shipped:
- **Personal dictionary.** If Flow got a word wrong and you fixed it, Flow remembers the correct spelling.
- **Tone of voice.** You can actively set the correct tone, punctuation, and style of capitalization based on how you enjoy writing.
- **Self-correction.** When you say "Let's meet tomorrow, no wait, Friday instead," Flow outputs "Let's meet Friday."
Beyond building a product that feels seamless to the user, these unique changes also show that we genuinely cared about the user's experience. This is one of the key factors that makes Wispr so successful: the problems users face are genuine concerns not extra tickets that are pushed off until as late as possible.
**If you show care for your users, users will care for your product.**
## III - Team
The best product in the world doesn't matter if the wrong people are building it.
Today we're around 200 person team. We're still tiny relative to other competitors, but **our output per person is absurd**. Here's why:
### 1. Structure by having 2-person pods.
Two engineers per project → Maximum ownership. Minimum communication overhead.
When a pod owns something, there's no ambiguity. No meetings about who's responsible. No Jira tickets passing between 6 people. Two people, full context, full accountability.
This is how you move at startup speed even as you grow.
Every additional person you add creates communication overhead that grows exponentially.
### 2. Hire ex-founders, not ex-employees
A huge percentage of our team are former founders.
Not because founding a company is a badge of honor. Because founders have a specific trait that's almost impossible to interview for: they can take the initiative to solve problems and no one else is going to fix it.
An ex-employee at a big company is conditioned to see a bug and file a ticket. An ex-founder sees a bug and stays up until 3am fixing it because they physically cannot go to sleep knowing it's broken.
That ownership instinct is the difference between a team that iterates and a team that waits for instructions.
### 3. Hire for taste, not just skill
In consumer products, taste is everything.
Taste is the person who looks at a 200ms animation and says "that's 50ms too slow" and can't explain how they know but they're right. It's the designer who rejects a color that's technically correct but emotionally wrong. It's the engineer who refactors code nobody will ever see because it bothers them.
These are the principles that we live by when it comes to hiring each member of the Wispr Team.
While it may seem specific, these are the key factors that truly move the meter and enable us to move fast with little overhead.
The more time you spend choosing an elite team, the less time you'll need training them later on.
## Closing Notes
Building a winning consumer company isn't a formula. But if I had to compress everything I've seen into one principle, it's this:
**Don't build something people want, build something people can't live without.**
We didn't win because we had better AI. We didn't win because we had more money.
We built a product that people didn't know they needed. Once it was in their hands, it became part of their workflow and created a new habit.
If you're building in consumer, save this article and ask yourself if you've gone through the three principles.
I hope this helps you gain some clarity on what it means to build a winning product, and if you have any other questions, feel free to drop it in the comments.
Happy building :)
