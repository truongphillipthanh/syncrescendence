## Description (no transcript available)

Dan Wang, author of Breakneck, joins to analyze the rise of the Engineering State. China prints widgets, while America prints dollars. But both superpowers are now engaged in humiliating self-sabotage. The only force capable of defeating the USA is the USA. Dan and Balaji cover the discontinuity from Mao to Deng, the dominance of Chinese manufacturing, and the debate over the 21st century: is the true rival to China the United States, or Bitcoin?
