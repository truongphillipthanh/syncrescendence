## Description (no transcript available)

AI just had its Super Bowl moment.

And if you work in tech, media, operations, education, or honestly anywhere near a computer, this episode is about you.

In Episode 65 of What the AI?!, Jeff Keltner and Annie Delgado break down what happens when AI moves from impressive to industrial scale.

Anthropic runs a Super Bowl ad mocking ads. The next day, OpenAI launches ads in ChatGPT. Tens of billions flow into AI funding. Nearly half of global venture capital now goes to AI companies.

That sounds like momentum. It also sounds like pressure.

Jeff and Annie unpack what this means for your job and your industry. A Harvard Business Review study shows AI boosts productivity by 33 percent, but workers are not working less. They are doing more. Burnout rises instead of falling.

Then comes the cultural shift. A romance author uses Claude to publish 200 novels in eight months. If AI can scale output like that, what happens to creative markets, pricing power, and discoverability?

Meanwhile, AI video gets better. Synthetic world models train self-driving cars on events that never happened. Waymo expands. Apple delays Siri again. The gap between demo speed and production reliability keeps widening.
