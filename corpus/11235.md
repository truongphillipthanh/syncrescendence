# Corpus Insight Report — 2026-02-19

**Generated by**: claudecron/corpus-insight
**Status**: PENDING

## Activity Summary
- Commits (last 24h): 59
- MD files modified (last 24h): 146
- Active intentions (URGENT): 4
- Active intentions (SPRINT/SESSION): ~30+

## Velocity Assessment

**High volume, low semantic density.** All 59 commits in the last 24h are `sync(ajna): inbox/outgoing sync from MBA` — automated Ajna sync operations. No commander, psyche, adjudicator, or cartographer commits. No feature/fix/docs commits. This means:

- The **sync pipeline is healthy** — Ajna is reliably pushing cross-machine state
- **Zero substantive work was committed** in the last 24 hours by any agent
- The constellation is in **idle/maintenance mode** despite 30+ active intentions

**Stalled intentions (P0/URGENT):**
- **INT-1612** ("Begin ALL automations") — Still active, no new automation commits
- **INT-1202** ("capitalize on heavy machinery") — Maximum velocity directive, but velocity is currently zero
- **INT-1209** ("Temporal intelligence refresh pipeline") — No pipeline work visible

## Orphaned Work

The `-SOVEREIGN/` directory contains **100+ ALERT and INCIDENT files** from 2026-02-17/18 that appear unprocessed:
- ~90 `ALERT-commander-*` files (minute-by-minute from 2026-02-17 14:33–16:56)
- ~30 `INCIDENT-INTEGRITY-*` files from orchestrator and auto_ingest processes
- 1 `ESCALATION-adjudicator-*` file (watchdog recovery)

These suggest a **significant incident on 2026-02-17** (possibly an alert storm from the orchestrator) that was never formally resolved or cleaned up.

**Commander INBOX backlog** (unprocessed TASK files):
- `TASK-LINEAR-STATUS-202602181020.md` — Linear status check from yesterday
- `TASK-SESSION-REVIEW-20260218.md` — Session review from yesterday
- `TASK-SESSION-REVIEW-20260217.md` — Session review from 2 days ago
- Multiple CONFIRM/RESULT files moved from 40-DONE back to INBOX0 (git status shows RD renames)

**DYN-CONSTELLATION_STATE proliferation**: 17+ numbered copies (`DYN-CONSTELLATION_STATE 11.md` through `DYN-CONSTELLATION_STATE 28.md`) suggest a write-conflict or duplication bug in the health watchdog.

## Recommendations

1. **Triage the -SOVEREIGN/ alert storm.** The 100+ unprocessed ALERT/INCIDENT files from Feb 17-18 represent unresolved operational debt. Bulk-review, extract any actionable findings, and archive or delete the rest. This is blocking clean git status.

2. **Fix the DYN-CONSTELLATION_STATE duplication bug.** The numbered copies indicate the watchdog or a sync process is creating new files instead of updating in place. Investigate the write path and fix the atomic update logic.

3. **Process commander INBOX backlog.** Two session reviews and a Linear status check are sitting unactioned. Either execute them or explicitly close them as stale.
