Do you start your day reaching for your phone before your feet touch the floor? Scrolling through emails, checking stats, reading headlines - only to realise you haven't actually **done** anything yet?

Research shows we focus on a single task for an average of [just 40 seconds before switching to something else](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/cant-pay-attention-youre-not-alone). With Slack open, that drops to 35.

We blame notifications. But distraction is merely a symptom. The root cause is deeper: **chronic overstimulation**.

## The Dopamine Loop

We're wired with a [novelty bias](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16880131/). Every new object of attention - a text, a like, a news update - triggers a small hit of dopamine. This feels good, so we seek more.

The problem isn't the dopamine itself. It's that each hit raises the floor of what feels "normal." And over months of constant stimulation, that floor keeps climbing.

So now you sit down to do something important. Your brain starts itching for something, anything, more interesting. Not because the work doesn't matter, but because your nervous system has been trained to expect more.

This is why willpower fails. You're not fighting distraction - you're fighting a baseline that's been trained too high.

## Boredom Lowers the Floor

So how do you lower it? You let yourself be bored.

Boredom is what happens when stimulation drops below the floor you've built. It's uncomfortable - genuinely unpleasant at first. But that discomfort is the point. It means the floor is recalibrating. Push through it for about a week and focus stops feeling like deprivation.

And there's another benefit. When you stop consuming, your mind doesn't go blank - it wanders. And that wandering is where your sense of direction comes from.

Research shows we spend nearly [half of our unfocused thinking on the future](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK595451/): planning conversations, working through problems, figuring out what we actually want. This is the quiet processing that tells you something's off at work, or that you should call your sister, or that the project you've been avoiding is actually the one that matters most.

Fill every gap with your phone and you lose access to that signal. You stay busy, but you stop knowing why. Life starts feeling reactive - like you're always responding to what's in front of you instead of moving toward something that matters.

## The 8-Day Fix

Most guides on this want you to become a tech-free monk doing cold plunges at a silent retreat. That's nice if you're a 25-year-old founder with no dependents and a passive income stream.

For everyone else, the phone isn't the enemy - it's how you coordinate childcare, do your job, and get home.

### Day 1: Audit

Before you change anything, find out where the time actually goes. Download a screen time tracker (iOS has one built in; Android has Digital Wellbeing). Don't try to change your behaviour - just watch it. At the end of the day, write down two numbers: total screen time, and your honest estimate of how many hours you spent in genuine focus.

### Day 2: Add friction to autopilot

Look at yesterday's report. Find your top two time sinks—probably social media or news. Now make them slightly harder to access. Move the apps to a folder on your last home screen. Log out so you have to enter your password each time. You're not blocking anything. You're just interrupting the reflex.

### Day 3: Protect your morning

Your first hour sets the tone. Tonight, plug your phone in outside your bedroom. Use a cheap alarm clock or an old phone with no apps. When you wake up, don't check anything until after you've showered, dressed, and had breakfast.

### Day 4: Protect your evening

Set a wind-down alarm for 8pm. When it goes off, phone goes to its charging spot in another room. If you need to be reachable for emergencies, leave the ringer on - but not in your hands. You'll fall asleep faster and you'll wake up less groggy.

### Day 5: Reclaim one transition

Pick one part of your day that's currently filled with your phone: the commute, your lunch break, the walk to get coffee. Today, do it with nothing. No music, no podcasts, no scrolling.

### Day 6: Batch your inputs

Check email and messages three times: morning, midday, end of day. Notifications off in between. It takes about 20 minutes to fully refocus after a distraction - constant checking means you never get there. If that's not possible, carve out one 90-minute block where you're unreachable.

### Day 7: Create something

Try making something. Cook without a recipe. Write something with no purpose. Doodle. You're not trying to produce anything good - you're giving your brain somewhere to go that isn't consumption.

### Day 8: Measure again

Check your screen time. Compare it to Day 1. Now estimate your deep work hours again - not time at your desk, but time genuinely focused on something that matters.

Then ask yourself two questions: What's different? And what did your mind come up with this week that it didn't have room for before?

## Bottom Line

Will this solve everything? No. You'll still get distracted. You'll still waste time. But you might waste it consciously - choosing to watch TV or do nothing - instead of losing it to reflexive scrolling you don't even remember.

That might not be enough for an inspirational LinkedIn post - but nobody needs another one of those anyway.
