# The Future of Design is Direct Design

(Description: A header image featuring a bright blue gradient background with three design tool application icons arranged horizontally: a coral-orange icon with a white star/asterisk shape (Cursor), a dark navy icon with colorful dots in red, green, and blue (Figma), and a dark gray icon with a white 3D geometric pyramid shape (possibly Claude Code). The icons are rounded squares, centered against the gradient.)

I largely stopped using Figma ~3 months ago.

Not because I have anything against Figma. I used it every day for years. It's a great tool. But at some point I realized I was spending hours designing something that didn't exist yet... pixel-pushing a picture of a product... only to hand it off and watch it come back looking slightly different. Every time.

## The Handoff Problem

The handoff was always the problem. It was never the design.

Here's what my workflow looks like now: I open Cursor or Claude Code. I describe what I want to build. Not what it should look like... what it should _do_, how it should _feel_, who it's _for_. Then I start making decisions in real-time as it comes to life in front of me.

Does this interaction feel right? Does our onboarding have a good narrative ar? Is this flow too long? I'm not reviewing a mockup. I'm shaping a living product. And if something feels off, I change it myself... right there, in the code - the same way I'd nudge a pixel in Figma.

## Defining Direct Design

I call this **Direct Design**.

Direct Design is what happens when you remove the translation layer between intent and reality.

For 30 years, the product development process has had a fundamental bottleneck: the handoff. A designer thinks about a problem, makes a picture of a solution in a design tool, writes a spec explaining what they meant, hands it to an engineer who interprets that spec, builds something that's close but not quite right, and then everyone goes back and forth for a few weeks until it ships at 80% of the original vision.

The entire field of "design systems" exists because of this gap. We built elaborate component libraries and documentation - all to solve a communication problem between two people sitting ten feet apart.

### Eliminating the Middleman

Direct Design skips all of that. Not because the communication doesn't matter, but because there's no one to communicate _to_. The person with the vision is the person building the thing.

## Direct Design vs. Vibe Coding

I want to be clear about something: this isn't vibe coding.

Vibe coding is when you throw a prompt at an AI and hope for the best. It's building without thinking. The Cursor CEO (@mntruell) himself called it "shaky foundations" and he's right.

Direct Design is the opposite. It's rigorous. It requires you to hold the entire product in your head - the user's problem, the interaction model, the edge cases, the business logic, the feel. You get to make every single product decision yourself, in real-time, with a working version in front of you.

That's not less disciplined than the old process. It's more.

## The Quality Outcome

Here's what surprised me: the product gets better.

Not because AI necessarily writes better code than engineers. But because the feedback loop collapses from weeks to hours or even minutes. Designing in Figma, I was _guessing_ how it would feel when an engineer built it. Designing directly in code, I'm _experiencing_ it. I catch things I never would've caught in a mockup.

On my team now, I design directly in Cursor or Claude Code and one of our engineers handles the complex architecture. When they build something, instead of writing up design feedback, I just go in and make the tweaks myself. We cut out an entire feedback loop. We ship faster. And what ships is closer to the vision.

## The Core of Design

The value of a great designer was never in drawing rectangles in Figma.

It was always in knowing _what to build and why_ - product taste, user instinct, the ability to hold complexity and make it simple.

That skill just became directly executable.

**Taste now has a compiler.**

## The Future

We spent decades trying to teach engineers to think like product people.

Turns out it was easier to give product people the ability to ship.

That's Direct Design. And the product thinkers who embrace it early are going to build the most important things of the next decade.
