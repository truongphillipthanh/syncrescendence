# Macroscopic Quantum Tunneling to Quantum Computing

## Executive Summary
John Martinis, 2025 Nobel laureate in Physics, describes the 40-year journey from demonstrating macroscopic quantum tunneling in Josephson junctions to achieving quantum supremacy at Google. The foundational insight: billions of electrons can act collectively as a single quantum particle, enabling macroscopic superposition states that form the basis of quantum computing. He projects useful quantum computers in 5-10 years, with drug discovery and materials simulation as killer apps.

## Key Insights

### Macroscopic Quantum Mechanics
The Nobel Prize work proved that large systems (billions of electrons in a Josephson junction circuit) can exhibit quantum mechanical behavior—specifically, quantum tunneling. All electrons act coherently as a single quantum particle, enabling macroscopic superposition states.

### From Tunneling to Qubits
If a circuit can tunnel between two states quantum mechanically, it can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously—the definition of a qubit. Martinis's foundational work enabled the superconducting qubit architecture now dominant in commercial quantum computing.

### Quantum Supremacy Achievement
Google's 2019 demonstration: 53 qubits performing a computation in 200 seconds that would take classical supercomputers ~10,000 years. Controversy exists about classical algorithm improvements, but the principle was demonstrated: quantum computers can solve some problems classical computers cannot.

### Error Rates and Scaling
Current qubits have 1-in-1000 to 1-in-10,000 error rates per operation. Useful computation requires ~1-in-1,000,000 or better. Need to scale from ~100-1000 qubits to millions. Progress is steady on both fronts.

### Drug Discovery as Killer App
Molecules are quantum mechanical systems. Simulating them accurately requires solving Schrödinger's equation for all electrons—exponentially hard classically but natural for quantum computers. Could screen millions of drug candidates computationally before synthesis.

### China Competition Concerns
Chinese labs are publishing results on par with Google shortly after Google publishes. Suspicion that results are held until Western publication, then released simultaneously. US advantage may come from advanced fabrication (300mm tools via Applied Materials) unavailable to China.

### 5-10 Year Useful Timeline
Martinis estimates useful quantum computers—solving real problems classical computers cannot—within 5-10 years. Not replacing classical computers, but complementing them for specific problem classes: simulation, optimization, cryptography.

## Quotable Passages
> "Here was a system with billions of electrons all acting collectively, and they're all tunneling coherently—quantum mechanically tunneling as if they're one particle. This was the demonstration that macroscopic systems can behave quantum mechanically." — John Martinis

> "The computation took about 200 seconds on our quantum processor. We estimated it would take the best classical supercomputer about 10,000 years." — John Martinis

> "I'm worried that the Chinese government is saying, 'You can't publish anything until it's in the Western press, and then you can talk about it.' That's precisely what I've heard." — John Martinis
