I turned Clawdbot into my 24/7 executive assistant, and in this video, I'm showing you exactly how to do the same. 

After spending 100+ hours refining this setup, I've built a system where my Clawdbot, Klaus, proactively manages my tasks, checks in on what I'm working on to offer help, and even builds things while I sleep. 

I walk you through the custom dashboard I use to track everything it's doing, share the exact setup you can copy, and reveal the hacks I've discovered along the way that most people miss.
