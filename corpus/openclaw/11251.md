## Recommendations

1. **Assign owners**: All 20 issues are currently unassigned — assigning ownership will drive accountability and progress.
2. **SYN-24 (P0-Critical)**: Labeled P0-Critical but sits in Todo with no assignee, stale since Feb 6. Escalate or execute immediately.
3. **SYN-53 / SYN-51 (In Progress)**: Both Todoist and Jira onboarding are active — verify they have clear next actions and aren't blocked on external dependencies.
4. **Stale backlog hygiene**: SYN-17, SYN-19, SYN-28 haven't been touched in >7 days. Either promote to Todo with a plan or archive to reduce noise.
5. **Batch the platform onboarding**: SYN-51/52/53/54 form a coherent cluster (Jira/Trello/Todoist/TeamGantt). Consider sequencing them as a single sprint.
