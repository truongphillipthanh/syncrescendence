# CC32 PROGRESS HANDOFF

**Session**: CC32 | **Date**: 2026-02-25
**Previous Build Point**: `664b3b03` (archive cleanup)
**Current Build Point**: `37212fd3` (OL-5 Stage 2-3 — 3 atoms gated)
**Content Transformation**: First canon artifact landed (CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v1.md)

---

## I. WHAT HAPPENED IN CC32

CC32 is the first session to produce a canon artifact. The emergency anneal protocol from CC30 was executed correctly. No self-inflicted damage. Clean execution throughout.

### Sovereign↔Commander Exchange (Chronological)

**Turn 1 — Sovereign**: "what this means means actually fucking read HANDOFF-CC31"
- Commander read the CC31 handoff verbatim. Reported plainly: total loss session, 3 seared invariants, CC30 protocol still valid and unexecuted.

**Turn 2 — Sovereign**: Delivered CC30 emergency ascertescence dispatch with strict execution order (recovery → banner → OL-5 → Diviner questions). Initially referenced `git checkout 1eb3d68 -- .` as reset point.
- Commander flagged: `1eb3d68` is the remote pre-CC30 state and would nuke 4 local commits. Asked whether Sovereign meant `bf38e49a` (CC30 safe build point) instead.

**Turn 3 — Sovereign**: Explicit confirmation thesis. "No — do NOT use 1eb3d68. Use bf38e49a." Provided exact safe recovery commands.
- Commander executed: `git reset --hard bf38e49a` → verified AGENTS.md state → replaced condensed banner with verbatim Sovereign directive (header + footer) in AGENTS.md + CLAUDE-EXT.md → `make configs` → committed `29cf36d0` → pushed.

**Turn 4 — Sovereign**: "go, dispatch the swarm, give me what i need to ask diviner"
- Commander executed: `protease_queue.py --max-atoms 5` pulled 5 atoms (scores 0.723-0.767, intentions INT-P035 + INT-1707). Built Diviner prompt with all 7 escalated questions from Adjudicator. Staged in engine/certescence/CC32/ + Desktop. Committed `5d970dc1`, pushed.

**Turn 5 — Sovereign**: "diviner has landed. i threw a bunch of other responses in. please triage the sequentialization"
- Commander triaged ALL untracked files. Found:
  - 9 unique CC30-CC32 artifacts (chronologically sequenced)
  - 5 duplicates (hash-verified: identical content in multiple locations)
  - 3 spotty names needing canonicalization (copy → CONFIRMATION, -2 → PINNACLE, -3 → DISPATCH)
  - 1 lapse: Oracle verification of Diviner (response #9) had no file in inbox
- Reported full audit with hash table, proposed rename/delete plan.

**Turn 6 — Sovereign**: "please now triage and verify if i did that correctly"
- Commander found `RESPONSE-ORACLE-CC32-VERIFICATION.md` had been dropped into inbox. Lapse resolved. Verified all 9 unique files with hashes. Confirmed sequence immaculate.

**Turn 7 — Sovereign**: Confirmed. "proceed. by the way, these handoff documents, you're rsyncing them to the desktop right? there's a vault that's filing these all away immaculately too?"
- Commander discovered: Desktop only had CC30+CC31 handoffs (CC26-CC29 missing). Certescence vault had CC26+CC28 filed but CC30+CC32 were loose in inbox.
- Executed full cleanup:
  - 5 duplicates deleted
  - 3 files renamed to canonical names
  - CC28 siege handoff moved to proper vault
  - CC29 duplicate removed
  - All responses filed into certescence vault (CC30/: 6 files, CC32/: 3 files)
  - All handoffs copied to Desktop
  - RESULT-CODEX duplicate cleaned
- Committed `664b3b03`, pushed.

**Turn 8 — Sovereign**: "wow, i don't need them on the desktop, actually, i only said that because I'm planning to delete them so i can have inbox zero and less noise/clutter"
- Commander: Deleted all 6 handoff files from Desktop. Clean.

**Turn 9 — Sovereign**: "and we have them all documented?"
- Commander: Confirmed. 15 handoffs in outbox/handoffs/, all CC30-CC32 responses in certescence vault, everything committed and pushed to GitHub.

**Turn 10 — Sovereign**: Dispatched Oracle's annealed output. Priority 1: Ontology Gate template. Then 3-atom reduced batch.
- Commander executed:
  1. Created `canon/01-CANON/CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v1.md` — FIRST CANON ARTIFACT. Committed `4eae2933`, pushed.
  2. Classified 3 atoms against the gate (all PASS: CON/drift 0.03, STR/drift 0.05, PROTO/drift 0.04)
  3. Staged axiom file in `-SOVEREIGN/AXIOMS-CC32-3ATOM-BATCH1.md` for Sovereign rewrite
  4. Committed `37212fd3`, pushed.

**Turn 11 — Sovereign**: "save progress, especially our textual exchange"
- This document.

## II. COMMITS (CC32)

| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| `29cf36d0` | fix: CC30 emergency banner — verbatim Sovereign directive in sources only |
| `5d970dc1` | feat: CC32 OL-5 Stage 1 — 5-atom queue built + Diviner prompt staged |
| `664b3b03` | docs: CC30-CC32 triangulation archive — immaculate filing |
| `4eae2933` | feat: CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v1.md — first canon artifact (Sovereign Objective Lock) |
| `37212fd3` | feat: OL-5 Stage 2-3 — 3 atoms ontology-gated, awaiting Sovereign rewrite |

---

## III. OL-5 STATUS (WHERE WE LEFT OFF)

| Stage | Status | Artifact |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 0. Objective Lock | DONE | Sovereign confirmed |
| 1. Queue Build | DONE | 5 queued, 3 selected (C-009 safety) |
| 2. Ontology Gate | DONE | All 3 PASS against CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v1.md |
| 3. Sovereign Rewrite | **AWAITING** | `-SOVEREIGN/AXIOMS-CC32-3ATOM-BATCH1.md` |
| 4. Promotion | Blocked on 3 | praxis → canon |
| 5. Verification | Blocked on 4 | integration_gate.py |

### The 3 Gated Atoms
1. **AX01** — Constitutional AI (Dario Amodei) → CON domain, drift 0.03, Knowledge chain
2. **AX02** — Three-layer memory architecture → STR domain, drift 0.05, Insight chain
3. **AX03** — Observe-before-act (PAI Algorithm) → PROTO domain, drift 0.04, Knowledge chain

### Sovereign Options for Stage 3
- **Approve as-is**: Commander promotes with existing classifications
- **Rewrite**: Edit axioms with Sovereign language/rationale
- **Reject any**: Gate sends to rejection ledger

---

## IV. WHAT CC32 PROVED

1. The OL-5 protocol works. Queue → Gate → Stage executed cleanly.
2. `CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v1.md` is the first canonical artifact — content transformation is no longer 0%.
3. The certescence vault and handoff vault are now immaculately filed.
4. CC31's 3 invariants held: sources-only editing, verbatim compliance, no repo surgery.
5. Recovery from CC31 took one turn, not one session.

---

## V. DAG CONVERGENCE — CC32 STATUS

| ID | Status | Movement |
|----|--------|----------|
| C-001 | ANSWERED | — |
| C-002 | **PARTIAL → ACTIVE** | First canon artifact landed. 3 atoms gated, awaiting promotion. |
| C-003 | OPEN | Adjudicator answered (decision atom format). Not yet canonicalized. |
| C-004 | OPEN | Adjudicator answered (triangulation triggers). Not yet canonicalized. |
| C-005 | ANSWERED | — |
| C-006 | PARTIAL | No movement. |
| C-007 | ANSWERED | Architecture re-validated (make configs, vault filing). |
| C-008 | OPEN | Adjudicator answered (sources antifragility). Not yet canonicalized. |
| C-009 | **UNASKED** | Standing item. Not addressed this session. |
| C-010 | **PARTIAL → ACTIVE** | -INBOX processing done (9 files triaged, duplicates removed, vault filed). |
| C-011 | RESOLVED | — |
| C-012 | OPEN | Adjudicator answered (minimum viable memory). Not yet canonicalized. |
| C-013 | **PARTIAL → ACTIVE** | Ontology gate defines metrics (atoms_in, axioms_out, canon_delta). First batch in flight. |

**Net: 6/13 resolved (46%). 3 items moved from OPEN/PARTIAL to ACTIVE. First promotion completes C-002+C-010+C-013 → 69%.**
