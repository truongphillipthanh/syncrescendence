Xcode 26.3 using XcodeBuildMCP's CLI to interact with the simulator.

Apple have made this very hard and in its current form isn't very useful, granted. The default environment has a very limited PATH, so it can't see most executables on your system. Potentially, a shim and a skill could fix this.

No. I did. XcodeBuildMCP is my 3rd party MCP server and CLI for iOS/macOS development.

They are quite different. Xcode MCP is essentially tapping into the IDE to expose the IDE build state, where as XcodeBuildMCP uses the lower level build tools and frameworks and doesn't require Xcode to be running. I think they can be complementary.
