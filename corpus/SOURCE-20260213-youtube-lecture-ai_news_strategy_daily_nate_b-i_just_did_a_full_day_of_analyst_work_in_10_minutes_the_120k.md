What's really happening when Claude shows up inside Excel and PowerPoint? The common story is that AI assistants help with formulas—but the reality is more complicated when the same intelligence that built a C compiler is now building your board deck.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why general intelligence in your daily tools changes everything:

 • Why a 10-minute operating model got validated by a Goldman analyst as a day's work
 • How financial data connectors from Moody's and LSEG eliminate the terminal grind
 • What the context layer between applications means for Microsoft becoming a dumb pipe
 • Where execution skills are evaporating while judgment becomes the premium

For knowledge workers spending hours in spreadsheets and slides, this is the dumbest these tools will ever be—and the upgrade cycle now runs on Anthropic's pace, not Microsoft's.
