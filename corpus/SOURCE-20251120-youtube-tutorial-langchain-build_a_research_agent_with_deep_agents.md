## Description (no transcript available)

Deepagents is a simple, open source agent harness built by LangChain. It uses some common principle seen in popular agents such as Claude Code and Manus, including planning (prior to task execution), computer access (giving the able access to a shell and a filesystem), and sub-agent delegation (isolated task execution). We're introducing a new repo with a collection of quickstarts that demonstrate different agents can be easily configured on top of the deepagents harness.
