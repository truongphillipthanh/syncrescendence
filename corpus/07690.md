## Claim (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260215-023-0002
**Lines**: 7-8
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The interoperability provided by AI agents erodes and wipes out the security and encryption previously offered by platform 'garden walls'.

**Lines**: 8-10
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Having end-to-end encrypted messages read by an AI bot converts private messages into plain text, which is then processed by a model potentially run by entities with divided loyalties.

## Concept (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260215-023-0001
**Lines**: 3-6
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.70

> AI agents provide "default bottom up interoperability" by enabling users to log in across services, bypass walled gardens, and aggregate content and data, thereby reducing platform control.

**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Beyond platform agents and agent advocates, there is a possibility of 'state agents' — universal intermediaries that mediate digital interactions and monitor users for state interests, such as the CCP.

## Praxis Hook (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260215-023-0005
**Lines**: 13-13
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Enabling genuinely secure, private inference for AI agents should be an urgent priority.

**Lines**: 13-13
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Chinese-hosted AI agents should be considered a non-starter to prevent a situation similar to TikTok, where foreign-controlled digital services create dependency and security concerns.
