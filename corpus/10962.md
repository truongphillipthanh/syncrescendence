# On Universe, Life, and AI
(Description: A cinematic landscape image showing a barren desert valley at sunset/sunrise. Ancient stone monoliths and architectural structures tower in the distance with warm golden-orange sky. In the foreground, small groups of robed figures stand on sandy terrain, suggesting an alien or post-apocalyptic civilization.)

1. The universe doesn't care.
2. Life, such as humans, cares and does have a value system.
3. If possible, all amoebas, flowers, and humans would want to live like kings. That is the value system of life.
4. The quest for life is to exert that value against this cold universe that doesn't care.
5. In this quest, each life and human is confined within their own reach and age. But life has this magic to summon more life, and discover tricks and trades among the alliance of lives — to arrange the energy of the universe according to their value.
6. Flowers borrow legs from bees to spread, and give pollen as food in exchange. Or, cells and bacterias marry to save on plumbing bills, and become mitochondria.
7. Humans accelerate the discovery of these tricks and trades with culture and tools, sculpting the universe further towards life and humanity's value.
8. Tools like wheels transport heavy loads of atoms better than legs. Wheels didn't happen with meatball lives, but it finally happened with human brains and clever arrangements of wood and stone.
9. Money and capital are also tools and tricks. They are the wheels and legs that convey information about energy and human preferences, and often store energy better than atoms.
10. Languages, memes, songs, and math are like that too. They shepherd human tricks and trades through space and time. They are humans' bee-dance to tell where the pollen is, has been, or might be going to be.
11. Together, those human-created tools and tricks are like non-meatball forms of life with varying degrees of vitality. They join the alliance with the rest of meatball life to spread life's value in this cold universe.
12. Among this alliance of life, competition is the shared love language. The VW Beetle is competing with insect beetles and the Beatles' songs for Mother Life's attention and her milk of energy.
13. Population growth expands this alliance of life. More bees and more humans bring more brains and GPUs to come up more tools, tricks, and trades. More life begets more.
14. Diversity strengthens this alliance of life. In fact, diversity is the very vitality of this union. It allows for a finer division of labor to organize the citizens of this alliance against the indifferent universe.
15. The Industrial Revolution is one such trick of organization. Fire, iron, and buried batteries from past lives free the current lives from the food stamps of the yearly sun. This momentary creative freedom breeds more brains and memes to unearth more tricks and treasures.
16. Science is another trick of organization. It orients brains and memes away from stories and opinions, but towards facts. And facts are the steel that made skyscrapers of memes and tricks possible, no more house of cards.
17. Cities and books are another such organizational trick. They are the pubs where brains and memes meet, so brain-bees can travel less to mix the pollen of memes. The internet and Reddit are the pubs on weekends.
18. Tools for atoms and tools for thoughts arrange the universe in favor of humanity and life's value system.
19. And here comes AI.
