**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Meaning is a metacognitive gradient because it is a higher-order, felt signal about cognition itself, guiding attention, effort, and action under uncertainty, rather than an object-level inference.

> Conscious faith is defined as 'calibrated openness to the whole', which is implied by reason's recognition of human boundedness, embeddedness, and inability to compute the entirety of a system.

**Lines**: 18-26
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The meaning crisis is a breakdown in cross-scale coupling (being out of synchrony with higher scales of causality beyond the isolated individual). Higher scales cannot be compressed into the local mind due to their complexity exceeding the smaller agent's modeling capacity. Therefore, an embedded organism must relate to higher-order patterns through calibrated openness or permeability, which the author calls 'faith'.
