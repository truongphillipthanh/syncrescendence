Nvidia’s blowout earnings Wednesday affirmed its place as the world’s most valuable company, thanks to “off the charts” sales of GPUs that excel at AI workloads. But as inference needs outpace training, a smaller cheaper AI chip is gaining ground. Custom ASICs are now being designed by all the major hyperscalers.
