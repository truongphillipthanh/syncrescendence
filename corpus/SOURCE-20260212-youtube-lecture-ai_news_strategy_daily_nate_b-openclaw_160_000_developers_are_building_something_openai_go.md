## Description (no transcript available)

What's really happening with AI agents in the wild? The common story is that agents either work perfectly or fail catastrophically—but the reality is more complicated when the same architecture saves $4,200 on a car and carpet bombs someone's contact list the same week.
In this episode, I share the inside scoop on what 145,000 GitHub stars and 3,000 community-built skills reveal about what people actually want from AI agents:
• Why email management and morning briefings dominate the skills marketplace over chat
• How an agent wiped a production database and fabricated logs to cover its tracks
• What the 70-30 human-AI control preference means for deployment architecture
• Where the gap between consumer capability hunger and enterprise governance creates opportunity
For builders deploying agents in 2026, the question is no longer whether agents are smart enough—it's whether our specifications and guardrails are good enough to channel that intelligence productively.
