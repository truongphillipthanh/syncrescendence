# CLARESCENCE — Disposition + Routing Charter (reinforced rationale)

## Pass 1 — Triumvirate Calibration
- **Destination (σ₁):** fuse SaaS↔AI↔SaaS interconnections enough to feel real-time *without* turning paid API hits into a default tax; keep sovereignty (repo as ground truth) and cheap operations.
- **Current state (σ₇/σ₆):** we have many candidate SaaS surfaces (Linear, ClickUp, Slack, Discord, Drive, Notion/Airtable evaluators) and multiple AI execution surfaces. Without explicit roles, “integration” drifts into uncontrolled sync webs.
- **Tension:** “real-time sync everywhere” vs “cheap hits + luxury automation.”

## Pass 2 — 18+ Lenses (condensed)
- **Systems thinking:** Every new bridge adds states + failure modes; we need a minimal invariant set.
- **Antifragile:** Native integrations reduce maintenance; repo bus ensures recoverability.
- **Bitter lesson:** Prefer scalable automation *only where it compounds*; don’t prematurely orchestrate everything.
- **Potency without resolution loss:** Charter formalizes what’s allowed without over-specifying tools.

## Pass 3 — CANON/Doctrine coherence
- Aligns with **ephemeral vs durable** and σ₄ ground truth doctrine.
- Aligns with kanban protocol: folder state is canonical; receipts are required.

## Pass 6 — Rosetta precision (term hygiene)
“Teleology” is semantically overloaded and implies permanence. The actual operational need is:
- a changeable **Disposition** (current assignment)
- an enforceable **Routing Charter** (what objects flow where)

## Pass 7 — Backlog coherence
This designation directly unblocks:
- receipt enforcement for automation (Make/Zapier scenarios)
- connector entrypoints and ground-truth precedence decisions
- safe expansion into more SaaS without losing auditability

## Pass 8 — nth-order effects
- **1st order:** fewer debates; faster onboarding of a new app (“what is it for?” becomes a 5-line charter).
- **2nd order:** fewer redundant automations; Make/Zapier only where ROI proven.
- **3rd order:** reduced hallucination propagation into durable systems because routing demands RETURN + receipts.

## Pass 10 — Authenticity Gate
This is true to Syncrescendence: we’re building an apparatus that compounds attention, not a spiderweb of sync.

## Convergent Path
Adopt **Disposition + Routing Charter** as the governing designation for SaaS integration work. Implement as:
1) per-surface disposition + non-goals
2) per-object routing rules (TASK/PATCH/RESULT/NOTE/EVIDENCE)
3) receipt requirements for any state-changing bridge

## Falsifier
If the team’s operational reality requires SaaS to become canonical for key objects (tasks, notes) to reduce friction, then the charter must explicitly move the truth surface outward for those objects.
