everyone is sleeping on NotebookLM...

this thing is literally the best option for:

- building a custom AI trained on whatever topic you need (content creation, copywriting, automations...)
- learning complex topics, studying at any level
- understanding RAG, working with large files from any source

plus it's powered by the second best model itw and the #1 platform for video education
