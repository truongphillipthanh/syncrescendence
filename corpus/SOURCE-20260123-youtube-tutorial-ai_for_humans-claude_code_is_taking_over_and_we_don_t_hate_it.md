## Description (no transcript available)

Claude Code is taking over and everyone is Claude Pilled. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei just we're 6 months from AI doing most software engineering. No big deal. 

AI programming is here in a big way. Claude Code skills are exploding: Remotion for AI video editing, Pencil for infinite AI design canvases, Compound Engineering for spinning up AI agents while you sleep. 

Your $200/month Max subscription doesn't stand a chance.

Plus Apple's working on an AI pin, Runway dropped Gen 4.5, LTX Studio has a wild audio-to-video model, and there's an AI monk with 2.5 million followers selling healing journeys.

WE'RE CLAUDE PILLED NOW. RESISTANCE IS FUTILE.
