# Ajna 6-Month Horizon – 2026-02-22 → 2026-08-22

**Vision Anchor**: Syncrescendence as institutional-grade individual capability layer.

**Q1 (Feb–Apr)**
- Full constellation autonomy: 100 % of directives complete without Sovereign intervention after Objective Lock.
- Ingest loop handles 50+ daily tasks across machines with <1 % drift.

**Q2 (May–Jun)**
- Verticalize first white-label component (e.g., sovereign directive parser as reusable MCP server).
- Three-track eval average ≥50/60 on all production runs.

**Q3 (Jul–Aug)**
- Cross-constellation handoff with external agents (Grok CLI, Perplexity) via INTER-AGENT.md extensions.
- Memory/ index reaches 10 k lines with zero context exhaustion incidents.

**Strategic Forks to Watch**
- [ ] iCloud → pure GitHub-native sync (if fileproviderd recurs)
- [ ] Add Grok CLI as sixth agent (Oracle native)
- [ ] Open-source one vertical module under AGENTS.md licensing

**Trigger**: Any CONTINUOUS-IMPROVEMENT.md score <9/10 escalates here automatically.
