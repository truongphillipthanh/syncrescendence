What's really happening with AI in 2025 — and what actually worked? The common story is agents are overhyped and progress stalled — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on which AI breakthroughs exceeded expectations and where the real value landed:
• Why letting LLMs use code execution unlocked agentic workflows for non-technical users 
• How solving AI-generated images enabled generative UI and new creative applications 
• What verification loops in AI agents revealed about system design 
• Where the messy middle layer proved more valuable than hyperscaler platforms

02:25 Images solved: Generative UI breakthrough 
04:33 Non-developers outperforming AI teams 
06:56 Verification loops supercharge agents 
09:12 The messy middle is the entire game 
10:43 AI slop vs. quality content systems 
12:45 Creative problem-solving takes over 
13:51 Cost-cutting to quality lift

The labor market is selecting for creative problem-solving over pure technical chops — and teams that scope AI workflows properly are moving real volume while quality-focused AI strategy is replacing cost-cutting mandates.
