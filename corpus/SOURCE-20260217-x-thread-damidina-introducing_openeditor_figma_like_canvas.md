Introducing OpenEditor, a Figma like canvas to preview code projects in real time.
- It is a performant desktop app that enables you to see your app from a bird's eye view.
- Instantly view changes across different breakpoints, app states and environments.
(Description: Embedded video showing OpenEditor interface with multiple design previews and UI components visible in a grid layout, displaying various website and application mockups including "ORIGINS," "ESSENCE," and "Initiate Handshake" elements across different viewport sizes and states.)

Thanks Ben! It uses a config file to map the routes and states to the preview

Seeing the previews in real time helps me work faster by seeing the implementation in one place
