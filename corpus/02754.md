> The Krebs cycle, commonly understood as a simple set of reactions for cellular energy generation, can also run in reverse to convert simple gases into living matter.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260118-405-0002

**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.40

> The reverse operation of the Krebs cycle, turning simple gases into living matter, could be the mechanism by which life on Earth began.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260118-405-0003
**Lines**: 17-19
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The tension between creation (forming organic molecules from gases) and destruction (burning organic molecules in respiration) within the Krebs cycle underpins ageing and diseases like cancer.
