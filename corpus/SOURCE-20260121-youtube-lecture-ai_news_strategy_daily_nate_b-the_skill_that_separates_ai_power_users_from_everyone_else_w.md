What's really happening with AI coding tools and how we work alongside them? The common story is that Claude Code and Codex are just competing products — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why the colleague vs tool distinction will define AI adoption:

 • Why Codex works like a CNC machine and Claude Code works like a machinist
 • How senior engineers get compound leverage from autonomous agents
 • What happens when you can't specify precise intent upfront
 • Why this same dynamic will shape all non-technical knowledge work

Cursor ran ChatGPT 5.2 for a week straight and produced three million lines of Rust code. No human touched the keyboard. But before you hear doom — the browser experiment revealed limits. The developers who succeed with autonomous AI know what they know and are honest about when they don't have clarity to delegate.

For individuals and organizations, the question isn't which AI is better — it's whether you're honest about which situation you're actually in.
