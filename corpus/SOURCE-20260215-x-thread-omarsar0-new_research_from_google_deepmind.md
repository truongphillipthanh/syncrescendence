# Intelligent AI Delegation
New research from Google DeepMind.
Really good read to understand what's ahead with AI agents.
It introduces a comprehensive framework for intelligent AI delegation, a sequence of decisions involving task allocation that also incorporates transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear role specifications, and mechanisms for establishing trust between parties.
## Why does it matter?
As AI agents move from isolated assistants to participants in complex delegation networks and virtual economies, the absence of robust delegation protocols introduces significant societal risks.
This framework aims to inform the development of protocols for the emerging agentic web.

(Description: Academic paper screenshot from Google DeepMind titled "Intelligent AI Delegation" by Nousadir Toufairi, Marijn Franssen, and Simon Oudshoorn from Google DeepMind. The document shows the paper's introduction section discussing how AI agents are able to tackle increasingly complex tasks, achieve more ambitious goals, and safely delegate their completion across to other AI agents and human allies. The text discusses existing task decomposition and delegation methods, environmental changes, and proposes an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation involving task allocation, transfer of authority and responsibility, establishing trust between parties. Keywords listed include: AI agents, LLM, delegation, multi-agent, safety. The paper discusses the introduction and hierarchic multi-agent frameworks, with citations visible including references to Castronova and Fabrieces (1998), and various other AI and delegation-related research papers.)
