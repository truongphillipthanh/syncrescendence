## Intention Alignment

| Intention | Progress Today | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| INT-1612 "Begin ALL automations" (P0) | Claudecron Phase 1 deployed (3 launchd tasks), 3 existing launchd services bootstrapped, watchdog hardened | **On track** — automation backbone live |
| INT-1501 "Close final 30% autonomy gap" | AVATAR-COMMANDER created, 12 IMPL items resolved, watch_canon hardened, claudecron operational | **On track** — measurable autonomy increase |
| INT-1202 "Maximum velocity during capability window" | 52 commits, ~15K+ insertions, 10+ sessions | **On track** — highest throughput day recorded |
| INT-1504 "Cascade deployment Mac mini→MBA" | MBA Ajna deployment complete, sync operational, deployment playbook written | **On track** — cascade differential functional |
| INT-1601 "Syncrescript + Rails sensibilities" | SYN-32 Phase 1 ENGINE consolidation, SYN-7 Ring→sigma rename | **Progressing** — structural cleanup, not language work |
| INT-1603 "JIT-software HighCommand" | No direct HighCommand work today | **Stalled** — zero progress |
| INT-1606 "Discord + Slack for OpenClaw" | Slack+Discord channel integration docs + dispatch tasks created | **Progressing** — research/docs phase |
| INT-1604 "Web app memory audit" | No direct work | **Stalled** |
| INT-1605 "NotebookLM research architecture" | No direct work | **Stalled** |
| INT-1607 "Setapp audit → terminal-first" | No direct work | **Stalled** |
| INT-1608 "Extract Apple Notes" | No direct work | **Stalled** |
| INT-MI19 "Palantir ontology / HighCommand" | No direct work | **Stalled** |
| INT-1614 "Student + apprentice FDE modules" | No direct work | **Stalled** |
| INT-1616 "LifeOS/PKM convergence" | No direct work | **Stalled** |

**Alignment Score**: 5/14 intentions advanced. The day was dominated by **infrastructure hardening** and **constellation deployment** — necessary foundation work, but the Session 16 Sovereign expansion directive (17 new intentions) created a backlog that is growing faster than it's being addressed. The P0 automation intention (INT-1612) saw real progress.

## Commits Today (52 total)

**By semantic prefix:**
- `feat:` 15 (29%) — autonomy expansion, ENGINE consolidation, ecosystem onboarding, Docker, constellation reconfig, claudecron, El Dorado armory, AVATAR-OPENCLAW, SYN-32, Slack/Discord
- `chore:` 15 (29%) — 8 auto-compact wisdom, 4 state commits, inbox housekeeping, README update, constellation state sync
- `fix:` 7 (13%) — launchd bootstrap, watch_canon, corpus-health, COCKPIT labels, constellation assignments, Ring→sigma, extended thinking claims
- `sync(ajna):` 4 (8%) — MBA inbox/outgoing syncs
- `docs:` 4 (8%) — execution logs, clarescence docs, claudecron research
- `refactor:` 1 (2%) — SYN-32 ENGINE consolidation
- `revert:` 1 (2%) — incorrect constellation machine assignments
- `other:` 5 (10%) — tranche extraction, implementation map, API key redaction

**Observation**: The `chore: auto-compact wisdom` commits are firing at nearly 1:1 with substantial work sessions. The 10-entry threshold may be too aggressive — each compaction is a commit that inflates the session log with duplicate entries (the session log hook fires per-session-end, creating N identical entries per session cluster). The execution staging log has **5 duplicate entries** with identical timestamps and fingerprints (SESSION-20260209-1900 appears 4x). This is a hook deduplication bug.

## Multi-Agent Activity (Ledger)

| Agent | Tasks Today | Outcome |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Cartographer | 2 (watcher smoke test, narrative exegesis) | Both COMPLETE |
| Adjudicator | 2 (watcher smoke test, launchd validation) | Both COMPLETE |
| Psyche | 1 (MBA cascade) | COMPLETE |
| Ajna | 1 (MBA deployment guide) | COMPLETE |

All agent dispatches returned completed. No blocked or abandoned tasks. The constellation is functional but underutilized — 6 tasks across 4 agents is low relative to the 52 commits from Commander. The multi-agent leverage ratio is ~8:1 (Commander:fleet), suggesting Commander is absorbing work that could be delegated.

## Tomorrow's Priority

1. **INT-1612 Phase 2**: The automation backbone (claudecron) is live but only has 3 tasks. Tomorrow should focus on expanding the scheduled task portfolio — inbox triage, corpus health checks, sync verification, stale intention detection.

2. **INT-1603 (HighCommand/JIT-software)**: This is the highest-value stalled intention. The Agendizer/HighCommand is the GUI substrate for INT-MI19 (Palantir ontology). Zero progress today despite being active since Session 16.

3. **Address hook duplication bug**: The execution staging log is generating duplicate entries. The `create_execution_log.sh` hook needs deduplication logic (fingerprint + timestamp check).

4. **Delegate more aggressively**: With Ajna MBA sync operational and all 4 agents returning completed tasks, increase dispatch volume. Target: 10+ agent tasks tomorrow vs 6 today.

## Token Economics

- **Sessions observed**: ~10 distinct session clusters (Commander) + 6 agent task executions
- **Estimated API spend**: With 52 commits implying ~10 substantial Commander sessions at roughly $2-5 per session, plus agent tasks at ~$0.50-1 each, estimated daily spend is **$25-55** across the constellation. This session (claudecron review) consumed ~$0.39 of the $0.50 budget.
- **Wisdom compactions**: 8 auto-compactions suggest high entropy generation. Each compaction itself costs a session invocation.
- **Efficiency concern**: The session log hook is generating ~5-8 entries per actual session due to rapid session churn. This inflates both the log and the compaction frequency. Consider debouncing the session log hook (minimum 60s between entries) or raising the compaction threshold from 10 to 20.
