On this year’s final episode of FYI, we will be taking the opportunity to highlight some of the best moments from throughout the year.  While we are grateful for every single guest that has joined the For Your Innovation podcast, here is a compilation of some of our favorite moments.
 

Key Points From Each Highlighted Episode:

• Vlad Tenev: Robinhood’s north star is a “financial super app” that uses tokenization/stablecoins to broaden access and ownership for everyday investors. 
• Tom Lee: Digital-asset treasury companies can be the traditional finance (TradFi) wrapper that makes token exposure easier to own inside existing market plumbing. 
• Dr. Jin-Hyung Lee: Real “understanding” of the brain means measuring and controlling circuits precisely enough to restore function—and building models that connect intervention to outcome. 
• Peter Diamandis: Aging is increasingly framed as an epigenetic + systems problem, where AI and better therapies could accelerate progress toward “longevity escape velocity.” 
• Peter Walker: Venture dollars are increasingly concentrated in AI (especially late-stage) while liquidity remains constrained without a healthier initial public offering (IPO) market.
