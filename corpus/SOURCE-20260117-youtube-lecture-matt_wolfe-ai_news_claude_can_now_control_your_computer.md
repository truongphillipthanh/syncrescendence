This was supposed to be a light news week. It absolutely was not.

Anthropic just gave Claude the ability to work directly with your files and documents, Google rolled out a wave of Gemini updates that quietly change how search, video, and shopping work, and OpenAI somehow found itself in more drama again.

In this video, I break down Claude’s new Cowork feature, Google’s biggest AI moves this week, OpenAI’s latest decisions behind the scenes, and a rapid fire round of updates you probably missed.

Some of this stuff is genuinely useful.
Some of it is messy.
And a few things feel like early signs of where AI assistants are actually headed.Let’s get into it.
