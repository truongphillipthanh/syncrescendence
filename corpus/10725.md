## Description (no transcript available)

Most AI today is built to predict the next word.
But intelligence doesn’t work that way. 

In this episode of The Neuron, hosts Corey Noles and Grant Harvey sit down with Eve Bodnia, Founder and CEO of Logical Intelligence, to explore energy-based models—a fundamentally different way to build AI systems.

Unlike large language models, energy-based models don’t rely on tokens or next-word prediction. Instead, they reason over an energy landscape, allowing them to evaluate many possible solutions at once. Eve explains why this matters for spatial reasoning, planning, robotics, and safety-critical systems—and why language may be better treated as an interface, not the core of intelligence.

We cover:
• How energy-based models work (without the math)
• Why LLMs hallucinate—and where constraints matter
• How EBMs and LLMs can work together
• What this approach means for the future of AI systems
