What's really happening with front-end engineering in the age of AI? The common story is that AI coding assistants are just making developers faster — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why front-end engineering is dying and what's replacing it:
• Why hand-implementing pages is collapsing into cheap, repeatable work 
• How composability shifts your job from ticket-taker to system designer 
• What it means when AI agents become 99% of your tool's consumers 
• Why auditability and row-level security need rethinking for dynamic UIs

13:45 What the Front-End Engineer's Job Becomes 
16:08 Where Classical Front-End Engineering Will Still Happen

The world no longer needs armies of engineers rebuilding the same UI primitives. AI-driven workflows now take Figma designs and output complete component trees. What remains is designing the primitives, schemas, and contracts that let entire organizations ship interfaces without wrecking the experience.

For front-end engineers, the transition is significant — but those who master composability will have more leverage than ever before.
