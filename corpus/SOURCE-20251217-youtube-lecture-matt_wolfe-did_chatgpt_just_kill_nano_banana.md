OpenAI just dropped a brand-new image model inside ChatGPT, and it’s a much bigger deal than it looks!

In this video, I break down GPT-Image-1.5, OpenAI’s new default image generation model, why it exists, and what actually changed. We’ll look at the new Images tab, faster generation speeds, better editing and instruction following, improved text rendering, and some features OpenAI barely mentioned (including likeness retention).

After the breakdown, I put it through some real, off-the-cuff demos to see what it can actually do!

Is this OpenAI’s answer to Nano Banana Pro?
And does it finally fix the biggest problems with AI image editing?

Let’s find out.
