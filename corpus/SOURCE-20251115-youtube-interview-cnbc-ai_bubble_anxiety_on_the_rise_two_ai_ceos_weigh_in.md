## Description (no transcript available)

AI euphoria is giving way to something else. The industry that once looked unstoppable is starting to bleed from a thousand tiny cuts. Short sellers like Michael Burry and Jim Chanos are circling, warning that the AI buildout isn’t a one-time investment but a recurring cost wave. And now debt is quietly taking over as the fuel of the boom. Loans, bonds, and securitized financing are propping up an AI infrastructure race that shows no sign of slowing. In this Take, CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa breaks down the new signals investors are watching, the rising risks behind the spending, and what founders like Amjad Masad of Replit and Navrina Singh of Credo AI see from inside the cycle.
