## Description (no transcript available)

Is the "Digital Middle Ages" finally ending? In my last video, we explored how the 2020s mirror the contraction and chaos of the medieval era. But history doesn't stop at the Dark Ages. Today, we’re looking ahead to the 2030s, a decade with the potential for a true Second Renaissance. What if bad thing not forever and good thing actually happen???

From the "re-spatialization" of the internet to the "Post-Cringe" era of new sincerity, we are seeing the exact same cultural catalysts that sparked 15th-century Florence. We discuss why AI is our modern "Printing Press," how "Corporate Latin" is being replaced by authentic vernaculars, and why the "Enshittification" of the economy might actually lead to a return of quality, ownership, and Civic Humanism.

The Siege of Constantinople is happening in real-time to our legacy institutions. Maybe it's time to build something new, of course starting with this YouTube channel. Also, subscribe to my Patreon.
