# Vibeclawdbotting: Every Possible Use Case to Market & Sell Using Clawdbot
(Description: An infographic displaying a network diagram in orange and gray tones. Central to the image is a stylized lobster/claw creature with a circled dot, surrounded by connected logos and icons representing various platforms: infinity symbol, "A", "M", "in" (LinkedIn), SimilarWeb branding, TikTok, Instagram, "M", Discord, Reddit, and Twitter. Lines connect each element in a web-like topology pattern, illustrating platform integration and interconnection.)
So, we kind of started an agency to do wild marketing/sales using Clawdbot. We did it for our own startup and for several of our friends. Here are the use cases that scaled best so far.
## 1. Buying Intent Sniping on X/Reddit/etc
Agent monitors X, Reddit, Quora for posts like "need an alternative to [competitor]" or "best tool for X", "Struggle with Y"
Reads context. If intent is real — replies with your product.
We got ~50 website visits per 1,000 views on our replies
- Reddit/quora replies get indexed by Google. Even if nobody clicks now, your product shows up when someone googles the same question — and you get some traffic from this for 1-2 more years.
- While replying, compare your tool with 2-3 others. Looks unbiased and converts better.
Btw, X will most prob ban you if you do 200+ automated replies per day.
## 2. AI Slop Machine
To rank in LLM SEO and get Google SEO, we write content on each topic and post it across 20 platforms. Agent writes content in each platform's style, does backlinks, and publishes.
Agent researches keywords competitors rank on in SimilarWeb, trends relevant topics in Google. Then we produce articles in each platform's style. LinkedIn article doesn't read like a Reddit post doesn't read like a Quora answer.
**20+ platforms:** LinkedIn, Medium, Substack, Quora, Reddit, Dev.to, Hashnode, IndieHackers, SlideShare, X threads, GitHub, Scribd, Issuu, Mix.com, Flipboard, Tumblr, WordPress.com, Telegraph, and more. All auto-publish, no editorial review. Anchor text rotates automatically. Posting spreads over 2-3 weeks so link velocity looks natural.
### Two Reasons We Do This
- **LLM SEO** — your content appears on 50+ websites in 2 weeks. When LLMs crawl the web for answers, they find you everywhere.
- **Google SEO** — all those backlinks pointing to your site stack up fast. You start ranking quickly. We hit 200+ visits/day within a week.
Cost: ~$1/topic. 100 topics/mo = 2,000 unique pieces w/ backlinks for $100.
Key thing — we also teach the agent via skills how to write content that LLMs cite and how to build backlinks.
## 3. Submit to 100+ Directories While You Sleep
Product Hunt isn't the only directory. BetaList, DevHunt, Uneed, LaunchingNext, Futurepedia, and 90+ more exist. (Link to all of them in the comments.)
Agent submits gradually over weeks. Adapts descriptions per platform. Tracks approvals.
Helps w/ SEO and being cited in LLMs — esp. if you go heavy on review sites like G2, Capterra, and Trustpilot.
## 4. TikTok Content Factory on Autopilot
We tried to replicate Oliver Henry's approach. It works.
Here's what he did: agent generates 6-slide carousels, writes hooks, posts as drafts. He adds music and publishes. 60 secs of human work per post.
Results: 500K views in 5 days. One post hit 234K. Cost: $0.50/post. The hook formula that works: [Person] + [conflict] → showed them AI → mind changed.
Can't tell it better than the original poster. More details here: https://x.com/oliverhenry/status/2022011925903667547
## 5. Autonomous X Reply Guy (Safe Up to 200 Replies/Day)
Agent scans feed 24/7. Finds convos relevant to your product. Drafts context-aware replies, posts from your page, and where relevant drops subtle ads.
So far for our company page: 400 followers in 4 days and ~7 demos.
## 6. Job Posting Sniper
Company posts "Hiring: Marketing Manager" — that's a public admission they need help and are about to spend $120K/yr.
Agent monitors job boards. Finds hiring manager's and his boss's email. Sends pitch: "Before you hire, try an AI agent at $500/mo that works today."
Easy. Esp. good for late-stage tech sales.
## 8. SEO Keyword Gap Exploitation
Agent compares your sitemap vs competitor's based on the whole web. Does research of trends in Google based on your niches. Finds keywords they rank for that you don't. Generates content per gap. Pushes to GitHub.
You see traffic in 5-10 days if you have good DA.
(DM me for contacts of people who can get your DA up to 40-50 in 7-10 days.)
## 9. Telegram/Discord Community Infiltration
Agent first researches and finds 20-30 relevant channels w/ 2K+ members in your niche. Joins them. When someone asks a question your product solves — replies with a legit answer and mentions your tool.
We run this in 15+ marketing and SaaS Discords rn.
## 10. Self-Improving Skill Files That Compound
Every OpenClaw agent runs on skill files — markdown docs that tell it exactly what to do.
Write 'em like onboarding docs for a new hire. Be specific. Include examples. Document every mistake.
### What Goes in a Skill File
- Which platforms to post to and in what format
- Outreach templates that got replies
- Outreach templates that got flagged or ignored
- Hook formulas that drove clicks
- Hooks that flopped and why
- SEO brief structure that ranks
- Anchor text rotation rules
- Reply tone per platform (Reddit ≠ LinkedIn ≠ X)
- DM templates that booked demos
- DM templates that got accounts banned
When something fails — add a rule. When something succeeds — add a formula. Agent never makes the same mistake twice.
How to set up: create a /skills folder. One markdown file per workflow. Start w/ 20-30 lines. It'll grow to 500+ within a week as you iterate. Every session, the agent reads these first.
