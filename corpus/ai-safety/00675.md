- **Recursive Amplification** -- positive feedback loops where practice generates insights that refine frameworks that enable deeper practice
- **Gaialogical Principles** -- Earth as conscious entity, humanity as its nervous system; Field Nodes as sensory/motor capacity for Earth itself
- **Voluntary Coordination** -- third coordination mechanism beyond coercion (state) and market (exchange); participation through demonstrated value
- **Distributed Resilience** -- alternative to fragile centralization through redundancy and distributed capacity
- **Integrative Interregnum** -- the interval between worlds where all boundaries soften and coherence must be consciously composed
- **Convergent Necessity** -- convergence of Fourth Turning, Fourth Industrial Revolution, and approaching Singularity
- **Rising Reflexivity** -- systems becoming conscious of themselves across all scales

## 22. KILL CRITERIA & ANTI-PATTERNS

### Domain Name
Kill Criteria / Anti-Patterns / Failure Mode Recognition

### Scaffold Capture Status: MISSING
**Evidence:** `CANON-00007-EVALUATION` has evaluation frameworks at conceptual level (quality assessment, coherence checking), but the specific operational metrics, kill criteria, and named anti-patterns are not encoded. The A/S/P/T maturity gate system is not represented. Some metrics thinking exists in `CANON-METRICS_STREAM_A` and `CANON-METRICS_STREAM_B` (in sn/) but these cover different measurement domains.

### Key Concepts (Rosetta Stone Candidates)
- **Kill-Switch** -- explicit trigger for pausing expansion and returning to foundations
- **Anti-Pattern** -- recognized failure mode requiring vigilance

### Specific Kill Criteria
1. **Thread->RSVP conversion below 3%** for two consecutive weeks despite iteration -> pause new channels, fix packet anatomy
2. **Any artifact released without micro-demo** -> release not permitted
3. **Event underperformance twice on adoption and NPS** -> pause events for month, invest in packet anatomy, helpers, single world-shard
4. **Sustained underperformance in any phase** -> pause and foundation reinforcement (generalized principle)

### Specific Anti-Patterns
1. **"Cohorts before Patreon; Patreon before demos; demos before instruments; instruments before vocabulary"** -- reverse order kills trust
2. **"Platform sprawl: three channels excellent before a fourth exists"** -- quality > breadth
3. **"Architectural churn: renaming primitives faster than you can teach them"** -- confuses community
4. **"Unlogged claims: any claim without micro-demo and log is a story, not a step"** -- documentation prevents self-deception
5. **"Scope creep at Malibu"** -- pick one measurable slice, publish to prove judgment; better operational simple than perpetually planning complex

### Catalyst Conversion Metrics (Kill-Switch Thresholds)
- Thread -> RSVP conversion >= 8% (healthy)
- 60-second YouTube completion >= 45%
- Artifact usage within 48 hours >= 20%
- Editorial cycle time reduction >= 30% via helpers

### Maturity Gates (Normalized 0-5, Published Monthly)
- **A-maturity (Abstraction)**: 0 scattered notes -> 5 constitution + stylebook + glossary + 3 case studies + dashboard
- **S-readiness (Simulation)**: 0 sketches -> 5 validated world-shard with residuals + public slider demo
- **P-viability (Physical)**: 0 breadboards -> 5 two nodelets stable with BOM+SOP; steward-performed swap
- **T-network (Transcendence)**: 0 manifesto -> 5 two independent Way Places with own programming reporting to shared commons

### Specific Deliverables
- Kill criteria specification document
- Anti-pattern recognition guide
- Maturity gate tracking dashboard
- Monthly maturity gate publication

### Timeline References
- Active from Week 1 onward
- Monthly maturity gate publications

## 26. CIVILIZATIONAL CONTEXT & TECHNOLOGICAL VELOCITY

### Domain Name
Civilizational Context / Technological Velocity / Phase Transitions

### Scaffold Capture Status: CAPTURED
**Evidence:** `CANON-00012-MODAL_SEQUENCE` encodes the four-stage modal sequence with maturity assessments; `CANON-00009-STRATEGY` references technological pacing; `CANON-00001-ORIGIN`, `CANON-00002-LINEAGE` encode civilizational context.
**Minor Gap:** Specific percentage maturity figures and named models (Sora 2, Veo 3.1, Optimus) are time-bound data not appropriate for CANON encoding.

### Key Concepts (Rosetta Stone Candidates)
- **Fourth Turning** (Strauss-Howe) -- 80-year crisis cycle, current Crisis period 2008-2030s
- **Fourth Industrial Revolution** (Schwab) -- AI, biotech, nanotech, quantum; blurring physical/digital/biological
- **Approaching Singularity** -- acceleration approaching asymptotic behavior

## 27. NETWORK EMERGENCE & REPLICATION

### Domain Name
Network Emergence / Replication Strategy / Distributed Coordination

### Scaffold Capture Status: MISSING
**Evidence:** `CANON-35200-GAIAN_NODE` mentions network at high level but does not encode replication model, support mechanisms, governance council, or success criteria. No dedicated CANON file for network coordination/replication exists. The specific replication model (open-source, decentralized, mutual support) is not structurally represented.

### Key Concepts (Rosetta Stone Candidates)
- **Network Emergence** -- organic growth of distributed Field Node network
- **Replication Gate** -- "Independent team launches second Way Place primarily from your playbook"
- **Open-Source Everything** -- complete design documentation freely available
- **Decentralized Coordination** -- no hierarchical control, voluntary cooperation only
- **Local Adaptation** -- each Node geographically and culturally contextualized
- **Distributed Ownership** -- each node independently owned and operated
- **Mutual Support** -- knowledge sharing, resource pooling, cooperative purchasing
- **Network Effects** -- collective learning compounds; coordination costs decrease
- **Civilizational Infrastructure** -- permanent, self-sustaining, widely replicable

### Replication Model
- **Playbook**: Fixed-fee ($5-10k) comprehensive documentation
- **Installation**: Time-and-materials support
- **Maintenance**: Optional subscription ($500-2k/month)
- **Training**: Workshops and apprenticeships for new operators
- **Network**: Troubleshooting and peer support

### Network Growth Projections

| Period | Nodes | Way Places | Practitioners |
|--------|-------|------------|---------------|
| Years 5-7 | 2-3 | 0-1 | 500+ |
| Years 7-10 | 5-10 | 2-4 | 2,000+ |
| Years 10-15 | 10-20 | 5-8 | 5,000+ |
| Years 15-20 | 50+ | 15-20 | 10,000+ |
| DOC-B Month 138 | 5-8 under construction | -- | -- |
| DOC-B Month 150 | 12-15 operational | -- | -- |
| DOC-B Month 162 | 20-25 operational | -- | -- |
| DOC-B Month 174+ | 25-30+ operational | -- | -- |

### Ultimate Success Criteria (DOC-B)
1. 20-30 operational Field Nodes proving complete systems integration
2. Each node achieving sustainable operation without external subsidy
3. Network functioning through cooperation, not coercion
4. Network surviving individual node failures without collapse
5. Collective intelligence improving all nodes over time
6. Model catalyzing thousands of parallel experiments worldwide

### What the Goal IS NOT (DOC-B)
- Building an empire or centralized organization
- Scaling to maximum nodes
- Claiming to solve civilization's problems
- Replacing existing institutions entirely
- Creating dependency on central authority

### What the Goal IS (DOC-B)
- Proving viability of specific civilizational alternative
- Demonstrating post-institutional coordination works

## 28. CAUSAL CHAIN (COMPLETE DEPENDENCY MAP)

### Domain Name
Complete Causal Chain / Master Dependency Architecture

### Scaffold Capture Status: PARTIAL
**Evidence:** `CANON-21000-CHAIN_MATRIX` encodes chain logic; `CANON-00012-MODAL_SEQUENCE` has the four-stage sequence; `CANON-00009-STRATEGY` has strategic dependencies.
**MISSING:** The explicit 10-stage causal chain as a named sequence; the business dependency chain as a named artifact; the phase overlap learning preparation principle.

### The 10-Stage Causal Chain (DOC-A)

```
STAGE 0: CONCEPTUAL ARCHITECTURE
    |
    v (crystallizes into)
STAGE 1: PERSONAL EMBODIMENT
    |
    v (enables authentic)
STAGE 2: EDUCATIONAL VALIDATION
    |
    v (generates revenue funding)
STAGE 3: ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY
    |
    v (accumulates surplus enabling)
STAGE 4: EXPERIENTIAL DIMENSION (Live Events)
    |
    v (demonstrates community capacity for)
STAGE 5: CAPITAL ACCUMULATION
    |
    v (finances construction of)
STAGE 6: PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (First Field Node)
    |
    v (operational success validates)
STAGE 7: DEMONSTRATION VIABILITY
    |
    v (documentation enables)
STAGE 8: NETWORK REPLICATION
    |
    v (scaling yields)
STAGE 9: CIVILIZATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE
```

### The Business Dependency Chain
```
ARCHITECTURE -> EMBODIMENT -> EDUCATION -> BUSINESS -> EVENTS -> NODES -> WAY PLACES
```

### Irreducible Constraints
- Cannot teach what hasn't been embodied (credibility destruction)
- Cannot monetize what doesn't deliver value (ethical violation)
- Cannot replicate what hasn't been proven (propagating unproven concepts)
- Cannot host events for communities that don't exist (empty ritual)
- Cannot construct physical infrastructure without accumulated capital (expensive failure)
- Cannot fund physical infrastructure without economic sustainability (premature collapse)
- Cannot simulate without computational mastery
- Cannot engineer without simulation validation
- Cannot construct without engineering knowledge
- Cannot replicate without demonstrated construction success
- Cannot coordinate networks without replication framework

### Phase Overlap Principle (DOC-B)
Phases overlap in LEARNING PREPARATION even though operational dependencies are strict:
- Study cinematography during Phase I computational development
- Study engineering during Phase II visual development
- Study construction during Phase III apprenticeship
- Study network coordination during Phase IV embodiment

**"No phase rushed. No dependency skipped. Patient mastery with urgent execution."**

- **MISSING**: 4 domains (14%) -- Instrumentation Architecture, World-Shards, Kill Criteria/Anti-Patterns, Network Replication

---

## PRIORITY GAPS REQUIRING SCAFFOLD ATTENTION

### Priority 1: MISSING Domains (no structural representation)

1. **Instrumentation Architecture (Domain 8):** The three-tier hierarchy (Helpers -> Demonstrators/World-Shards -> Nodelets) is a load-bearing convergence concept with no CANON encoding. Includes specific nodelet specifications (Power/Air/Water/Data), helper tool catalog, and the world-shard format specification. Requires a new CANON file.

2. **World-Shards (Domain 9):** The bounded simulation construct with its six required elements (domain/boundary, inputs, outputs, assumptions, error model, thresholds) has no structural home. Critical for the instrumentation rail and educational credibility.

3. **Kill Criteria & Anti-Patterns (Domain 22):** The A/S/P/T maturity gates, conversion thresholds, kill-switch criteria, and five named anti-patterns are operationally critical and completely unencoded. These provide the measurement framework preventing the entire endeavor from drifting into narrative self-deception.

4. **Network Replication (Domain 27):** The distributed coordination architecture -- open-source replication, decentralized governance, mutual support mechanisms, success criteria -- has no dedicated structural representation. This is the ultimate telos of the entire system.

### Priority 2: PARTIAL Domains with Significant Gaps

5. **Content Brand Architecture (Domain 6):** The 12-season structure with 88+ predetermined episodes, the Brand Bible deliverable, and the Phase 0 text-only constraint represent substantial unencoded intent.

6. **Live Events (Domain 14):** The four event formats, run-of-show template, consent framework, and production scaling plan are operationally significant and unencoded.

7. **Gaian Field Nodes (Domain 15):** System integration specifications (power/water/air/data/food), construction phasing with budgets, and SOP requirements need encoding beyond CANON-35200's high-level treatment.

8. **Educational Infrastructure (Domain 13):** Seven Pulses Dashboard, Cognitive Palace navigation, planetary facet exercises, shadow material, evidence ledger -- all operational educational constructs unencoded.
