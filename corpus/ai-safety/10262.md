## Description (no transcript available)

How do you keep your sanity when your job is to decide the future of AI, safety… and all of humanity?

In this episode of AI Across Borders, I sit down with Tom, who went from the US Supreme Court and the White House to leading global AI policy at Google DeepMind. We talk about his wildly non-linear career, how frontier AI is actually governed, and what really happens inside companies building the world’s most powerful models.

From AI safety, AGI risks, and global AI governance to what Tom tells his kids about the future of work.

If you’ve ever wondered who’s making the calls behind the next generation of AI, and whether we should trust them, you’ll want to listen to this one end-to-end.
