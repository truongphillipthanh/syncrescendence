Key Takeaways:

1. AI design covers five areas not just prompts - Prompting, ideation, design/prototyping, workflows, and staying conscious. Most people think better prompts equal better design. That's just 20% of the skill.

2. Use Google AI Studio for quick design variations - Upload 2-3 visual references. Describe what you want. Generate three different design directions in 5 minutes. What used to take 3-4 hours now takes 15 minutes.

3. Lovable builds functional prototypes in seconds - Describe the experience you want to build. Lovable generates a working prototype in 60 seconds. Not mockups—actual clickable experiences you can test with users.

4. Match tools to specific use cases - Custom GPT for effective prompts. Lovable for high-quality prototypes. Magic Patterns for design variations. Google AI Studio for free exploration. Cursor for full-stack experiences. Claude Code as all-purpose best.

5. Good design passes four layers not just visual - Visual representation, problem-solving, design principles, and implementation feasibility. Most people stop at layer one. Great design works at all four layers.

6. Context matters more than prompt length - Don't say "design a button." Say "design a primary CTA button for B2B SaaS onboarding where users connect calendar. Professional brand." Specificity drives quality.

7. Visual references anchor AI output - Upload 2-4 screenshots showing the aesthetic you want. These show AI what "modern and minimal" means to you. The quality difference is massive versus text-only prompts.

8. Iteration speed determines final quality - The magic isn't in the first output. It's in the 10th iteration after you've refined and tweaked. Review, identify issues, tell AI how to fix, repeat.

9. Always validate with real users - AI tools make generating designs easy. Only users tell you if those designs actually help. Show prototypes to 3-5 users. Watch them try to use it.

10. Workflows changed from linear to parallel - Before AI: sequential steps taking weeks. After AI: describe, generate, iterate freely. This is how top 1% designers work now.
