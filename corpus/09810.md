Jared Zoneraich from PromptLayer dissects the architecture of "Claude Code" (Anthropic's CLI agent), arguing that its success stems not from complex agentic frameworks but from a radical simplification: a single-threaded "Master Loop" paired with highly capable models. He contrasts this "give it tools and get out of the way" approach with earlier, brittle DAG-based (Directed Acyclic Graph) architectures. The talk breaks down the specific internal tools (Bash, FileEdit, Grep), the "Todo" planning mechanism, and the critical role of sandboxing and system prompts in making the agent reliable for production engineering tasks.
