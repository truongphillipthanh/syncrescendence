What's really happening with multi-agent AI systems? The common story is that more agents means more capability — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why the frameworks get multi-agent architecture wrong:

 • Why adding agents can actually make systems perform worse
 • How serial dependencies block the conversion of compute into capability
 • What Cursor and Yegge independently discovered about coordination collapse
 • Why complexity should live in orchestration, not in agents

Google and MIT found that once single-agent accuracy exceeds 45%, adding more agents yields diminishing or negative returns. The team dynamics metaphor imports human coordination problems we've struggled with for centuries. The architectures that actually scale look almost too simple — two tiers, ignorant workers, no shared state, and planned endings.

For builders deploying agents at scale, the investment should go into orchestration systems — not into making individual agents smarter.
