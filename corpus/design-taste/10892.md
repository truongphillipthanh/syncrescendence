X is the best social media platform for pretty much everyone.
Whether you're a dev, a founder, a copywriter, or anyone else. We live in an attention economy, and there's nothing better you can do than share your personality, your thoughts, and your progress with the whole world.
Imagine that you can literally be yourself, and people will love to hear your journey and help you along the way. I built my whole business on X, and couldn't imagine a better platform in today's world.
I have just 30k followers, and people recognize me around the world. I can DM any CEO on this platform and, with a high chance, have a coffee with him the next day.
So yeah, I'd definitely advise growing on X, and here's a step-by-step guide on how to reach 30k followers and beyond.
## 0-500 followers:
Become a 'reply guy'. Even @nikitabier says that.
Leave 30-50 high-quality banger comments daily under the accounts you're interested in.
X doesn't count the number of replies anymore, but it counts the virality of each of them separately and can push it if it's actually good. The idea is that if you leave multiple comments a day, you have a higher chance of getting caught by the algorithms than doing a single, highest-quality comment a day.
Plus, as you have 0 followers, no one is here to read your content. Engage more than you post (but still have a couple of posts on your feed or make 1-2 posts a week just to give a reason to someone to follow you back)
Create a list of accounts you wanna engage with daily. Appear under the same accounts over and over, so their audience and the author can notice you.
You shouldn't just leave comments like "Amazing", "Congrats", etc., it should be something meaningful (your thoughts, opinion, feedback, or a question).
Also, reach out to everyone you like. Just go in the DMs and ask them for advice, ask to grab a cup of coffee, or just say hi. People are nicer than you think, and some people will respond to you. I try to respond to most of the DMs I get, unless it's a sales pitch or a long-ass message that would take a decade to read.
To give you a little bit of hope, I was sharing my success story with @AlexHormozi and recently he said this:

## 500-5k followers:
Start doing giveaways/lead magnets (but never give away money, you'll attract the worst possible audience)
Giveaways attract a lot of attention and can become a funnel for your business, or worst-case scenario bring you a bunch of followers.
You can give away 3 things:
- Product
- Service
- Knowledge
An example of a product giveaway is something that you can just download and use. Such as a Figma/Framer file, a GitHub repository, access to closed beta, a Notion template, etc.
An example of service is super good for attracting clients as well. I've been making posts in the early days where I was offering 5 website redesigns for free. I was getting hundreds of comments, choosing the 5 coolest projects, doing the work for free so I can get some portfolio, and then offering service to all the other ones in the comments with a big discount. It was the fastest way to gather a nice portfolio and get some attention on X.
An example of knowledge is when you just give away a PDF guide with something that's extremely useful for your audience. When I just reached 1k followers, I made a guide on how to get 1k followers. Pretty straightforward.
To do product/info giveaways, you can use Gumroad or Lemon Squeezy to create a digital product page. Then whenever someone likes, comments, and replies, you can send them the link to your product. Here's an example:
(Description: Embedded tweet from Mark Vassilevskiy dated Mar 9, 2025. Content reads: "Introducing my latest @framer template, Maily ✉️ For the next 24 hours, you can get it FREE (normally $76) Here's how to get it: - Like + Retweet + Comment "Maily" - Follow (so I can send it to you) And I'll send the link + redeem code to you!"

Engagement metrics show 759 replies, 440 reposts, 2K likes, and 253K views.)
## 5k-10k followers:
Download an extension in Chrome called Tweet Hunter or just use the built-in Advanced Search on X.
The idea is to browse the biggest accounts in your niche and analyze their most boomed posts. The posts that got at least 1,000 likes and a lot of impressions.
Then just replicate some of them. Don't steal, but take inspiration from them. If you see that someone made an article on how someone is using Claude Code for design, you can take the same principle and write a guide on how to use Claude Code in SEO, for example.
Do that over and over to understand what content works for you the best.
After you see that something is working and bringing you more followers/customers/clients just repeat it until it stops working.
You can post the same post over and over again every couple of months, as people tend to forget what they saw a long time ago or bookmarked.
## 10k-30k+ followers:
On this stage, only the volume matters.
Make 5-10 posts on a daily basis. It can be shitposts, pics from the vacations, client-related posts, literally anything.
At this stage, you have enough potential for your tweets to hit millions of views. Now you can actually experiment with virality.
I'd also recommend writing long-form articles right now, as Elon is pushing them better than usual posts right now. That's one of the reasons why I'm writing articles right now as well
In a nutshell, do at least 5 posts a day, 1-2 articles a week, and a thread a week. The more consistent you are, the more of a snowball effect you'll get.

The most difficult part is always the beginning.
Getting the first 500 followers was harder than growing from 10k to 30k. But if you follow this path, iterate a lot, and will just do it consistently you'll definitely get thousands of followers over time.
Hope this article was useful! Feel free to DM if you have any questions
