## Claim (7)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260211-001-0001
**Lines**: 5-9
**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.80

> The author largely stopped using Figma approximately three months prior to writing this, not due to issues with Figma itself, but because of the recurring problem of designs not translating perfectly from mockup to final product.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260211-001-0002
**Lines**: 13-13
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.80

> The 'handoff' from design to engineering was consistently the source of discrepancies between the intended design and the shipped product.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260211-001-0005
**Lines**: 29-34
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.80

> For three decades, the product development process has been hindered by a fundamental bottleneck: the handoff between designers and engineers, leading to an 80% realization of the original vision after weeks of iteration.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260211-001-0006
**Lines**: 36-38
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.80

> The entire field of 'design systems' emerged to address the communication gap inherent in the design-to-engineering handoff.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260211-001-0009
**Lines**: 51-54
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Direct Design is a rigorous process that demands the designer hold the entire product context (user problem, interaction model, edge cases, business logic, feel) in mind, making real-time decisions with a working version.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260211-001-0010
**Lines**: 59-63
**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Direct Design leads to a better product outcome because the feedback loop collapses from weeks to hours or minutes, allowing for immediate experience and correction of design elements in code.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260211-001-0012
**Lines**: 70-72
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.90

> The true value of a great designer lies in their ability to determine 'what to build and why,' encompassing product taste, user instinct, and the capacity to simplify complexity, rather than merely drawing in design tools.

## Concept (4)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260211-001-0004
**Lines**: 27-27
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Direct Design is defined as the process that occurs when the translation layer between a designer's intent and the final product's reality is removed.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260211-001-0007
**Lines**: 41-43
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Direct Design eliminates the need for a 'middleman' in communication because the person with the product vision is also the one building it.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260211-001-0008
**Lines**: 47-48
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Vibe coding is characterized as throwing a prompt at an AI and hoping for a good outcome, or building without sufficient prior thought.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260211-001-0013
**Lines**: 74-74
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Direct Design enables 'product taste' to be directly executable, effectively providing a 'compiler' for taste.

## Praxis Hook (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260211-001-0003
**Lines**: 15-20
**Context**: method / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The author's current workflow involves using tools like Cursor or Claude Code to describe the desired product functionality, feel, and target audience, then making real-time decisions as the product is built, directly in code.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260211-001-0011
**Lines**: 64-67
**Context**: method / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.70

> In a team setting, the author practices Direct Design by making tweaks directly in code (using Cursor or Claude Code) rather than writing design feedback, thereby eliminating an entire feedback loop and accelerating shipping.
