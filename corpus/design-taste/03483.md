**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The 'death of SaaS' refers specifically to a type of software business characterized by building a UI around common business workflows, adding integrations, and charging per seat, rather than the cessation of software purchases entirely.

## Framework (3)

**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.40

> The 'Thin Middle Squeeze' describes a three-layer model of software value: the AI agent (top layer) executes work, the SaaS UI (middle layer) provides dashboards and workflows, and systems of record (bottom layer) store data. Value is shifting from the middle layer to the agent and data layers, crushing the SaaS UI.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260204-003-0013
**Lines**: 101-127
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.40

> New areas where software investment is shifting include AI platform subscriptions (usage-based pricing), systems of record (for clean, authoritative data), security, governance, and compliance (for agent deployment at scale), outcome-based pricing (software priced like labor), and services (for implementation and customization of AI systems).

**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The 'old playbook' for SaaS involved building a workflow UI, charging per seat, and growing revenue by increasing customer headcount. The 'new playbook' requires building solutions that own data, execute outcomes, or secure systems, pricing based on value delivered rather than per-seat.

**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.40

> To succeed in the new software landscape, entrepreneurs should build at the agent layer (AI-native tools that execute workflows, priced on outcomes), the data layer (own proprietary data, become an authoritative backend), the infrastructure layer (security, monitoring, governance for AI agents), or the services layer (implementing and customizing AI systems for businesses).
