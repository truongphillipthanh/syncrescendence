## Description (no transcript available)

CES is always a mix of genuinely exciting tech and a lot of stuff you’ll forget five minutes later. In this video, I’m focusing on the products that actually stood out to me this year. Not concepts, not hype, not maybe someday ideas, but real tech that felt useful, thoughtful, and surprisingly polished.
From smart hardware to AI powered tools, these were the things that made me stop, ask questions, and think “okay, this is actually cool.” If you want a clean, no nonsense look at the best tech I saw at CES 2026, this is the roundup for you. Let’s jump in.
