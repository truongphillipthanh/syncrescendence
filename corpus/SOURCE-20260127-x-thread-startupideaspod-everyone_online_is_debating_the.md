# Clawdbot (aka Moltbot) Setup Guide

Everyone online is debating the best Clawdbot (aka Moltbot) setup. I've tested every method.

Here's what actually works:

## Cloud/VPS:
- Cheapest.
- Fastest to start.
- But you're plugging in APIs for everything.
- Technically confusing for most people.

## Mac Mini (or any spare computer):
- You control the environment.
- You control what tools it accesses.
- You can watch it work in real time.

That last part matters.

Watching Clawd (aka Molty) on screen teaches you how it thinks. The more you tinker, the better you get.

Skip the "correct" path.

Start with hardware you can see.
