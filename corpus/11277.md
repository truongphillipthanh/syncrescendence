# Daily Session Review — 2026-02-19

**Generated by**: claudecron/session-review
**Status**: PENDING

## Sessions Today

6 sessions logged in DYN-EXECUTION_STAGING (20:27–20:55 UTC window):

| Session | Time (UTC) | Fingerprint | Outcome | Key Deliverable |
|---------|------------|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| SESSION-20260219-2027 | 20:27 | 5f091d4 | SUCCESS | Wisdom auto-compact |
| SESSION-20260219-2032 | 20:32 | 947f1f8 | SUCCESS | Ajna sync |
| SESSION-20260219-2037 | 20:37 | c756d5a | SUCCESS | Ajna sync |
| SESSION-20260219-2055 | 20:55 | a150b4f | SUCCESS | .DS_Store integrity gate fix |

All sessions were short-lived (< 10 min each). No extended directive execution occurred.

## Substantive Commits (Non-Sync)

Only **4 substantive commits** today (out of ~72 total):

1. `d8b1bf0` **feat**: INT-1901 + INT-C012 — Grok Build constellation avatarization (backlog, P2)
2. `d8c82d9` **fix(orchestration)**: use bash prefix for integrity_gate calls in launchd context
3. `1e895e5` **fix(orchestration)**: gitignore runtime breaker and budget state files
4. `a150b4f` **fix(orchestration)**: pre-clean Finder .DS_Store from git refs before integrity gate

**Pattern**: 3 of 4 substantive commits are infrastructure bug fixes for the auto-ingest/integrity gate system. The system spent the day fixing itself rather than executing intentions.

## Sync Volume

~68 `sync(ajna)` commits — MBA-to-Mac-mini sync running every ~5 minutes across the full day. Sync pipeline is healthy and continuous.

## Intention Alignment

| Intention | Progress Today | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| INT-1201 (self-sustaining accounts) | No progress | **Stalled** — missed Jan 31 deadline, no reset |
| INT-1202 (maximize construction velocity) | Minimal — only infrastructure fixes | **Below tempo** |
| INT-1209 (temporal intelligence refresh) | No progress | Stalled |
| INT-1612 (begin ALL automations) | Integrity gate fixes stabilize auto-ingest | **Incremental** — fixing, not building |
| INT-1501 (maximize autonomy, close 30% gap) | No direct progress | Stalled |
| INT-1504 (cascade deployment MBA→mini) | Sync pipeline healthy | **Maintaining** |
| INT-1601–1607 (Session 16 expansion) | No progress on any | **Stalled** |

**Verdict**: Today was a **maintenance day**, not an execution day. The constellation ran autonomously (sync pipeline, auto-ingest, watchdog) but produced no forward progress on any strategic intention. The 3 orchestration fixes suggest the integrity gate was failing in launchd context — a real problem, but reactive, not proactive.

## Gap Analysis

1. **No Sovereign-directed sessions occurred.** All 6 sessions were automated/short. No Oracle session, no directive execution.
2. **Adjudicator dispatched one deferred commitment followup** (dc_002) — completed. But this is housekeeping, not execution.
3. **68 sync commits with zero substantive payload** — the MBA and Mac mini are exchanging data continuously, but no agent is producing work product from that data.
4. **Ajna skill-install task** (234 skills) is IN_PROGRESS but no completion signal yet.

## Tomorrow's Priority

Based on intention alignment gaps, tomorrow's first session should:

1. **Address INT-1612 (automations)** — the integrity gate is now fixed; validate that auto-ingest runs cleanly end-to-end, then shift from fixing infrastructure to deploying new automations (Hazel, Make/Zapier, webhook bridges).
2. **Advance INT-1202 (construction velocity)** — pick one high-value backlog item and execute it fully rather than spreading across maintenance.
3. **Triage INT-1201** — the self-sustaining accounts deadline is 19 days past due. Either reset the target with Sovereign input or mark superseded.

## Token Economics

- 6 sessions logged, all short-lived (~2-5 min execution windows)
- Estimated API spend: ~$2-4 across Claude + sync overhead
- Most token consumption was in sync commits (Ajna on MBA), not in directive execution
- Budget efficiency: **low** — high commit volume, low intention throughput
