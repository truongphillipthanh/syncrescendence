## Description (no transcript available)

Sam Altman says AI superintelligence is 2 years away. Google dropped Gemini 3.1 with benchmark scores that look like a full generation leap. The AI upgrades are here. Are we ready?

Oh and Anthropic released Claude Sonnet 4.6, OpenAI is rumored to be adding a spicy "Citron Mode" to GPT-5.3, and Sam and Dario Amodei refused to hold hands on stage like two kids at a school dance. 

Plus Hollywood is threatening to sue over Seedance 2.0, Google's new Lyria 3 AI music model is fine (we tested it with a McNugget rap), the OpenClaw founder got hired by OpenAI, and Kevin made Mr. Tibbs delete himself to create a better version. He's fine with it. Probably.

SUPERINTELLIGENCE IN TWO YEARS. THEY CAN'T EVEN HOLD HANDS. WE'RE FINE.
