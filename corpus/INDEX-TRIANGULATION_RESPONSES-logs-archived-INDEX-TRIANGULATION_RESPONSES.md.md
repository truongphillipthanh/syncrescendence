## CC26 Ascertescence Responses

**Council**: Commander Council 26 (CC26)
**Playbook**: Triangulation Protocol (CLAUDE.md — Triangulation Playbook)
**Cycle**: Commander → Oracle → Sovereign relay → Commander → Adjudicator → Sovereign relay → Commander → Diviner

| Leg | Agent | File | Status | Notes |
|-----|-------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Oracle | `RESPONSE-ORACLE-ASCERTESCENCE-CC26.md` | **LANDED** | Full response collected 2026-02-24. Covers C-001 (cadence), C-002 (atom integration), C-003 (graph query), C-004 (feedback loops), C-005 (autonomy). |
| 2 | Adjudicator | `RESPONSE-ADJUDICATOR-ASCERTESCENCE-CC26.md` | **PENDING** | Not yet collected. Awaiting Commander→Adjudicator prompt relay. |
| 3 | Diviner | `RESPONSE-DIVINER-ASCERTESCENCE-CC26.md` | **PENDING** | Not yet collected. Awaiting Adjudicator leg completion + Diviner prompt relay. |

**Next action**: Commander generates CC26 Adjudicator prompt (`PROMPT-COMMANDER-ASCERTESCENCE-CC26-ADJ.md`), Sovereign relays via `ascertescence_relay.sh CC26 send adjudicator`.

## Notes

- All 32 existing RESPONSE files are marked **unprocessed**. As of CC26, none have been fully metabolized into praxis/canon/decision atoms by Commander through a dedicated synthesis session.
- The DC-110 Vanguard file uses agent label "vanguard" — this agent is not in the current 5-agent constellation registry. The file predates the constellation's current naming (likely predates Adjudicator's role crystallization). Do not relabel without Sovereign confirmation.
- DC-201/202 Oracle responses are multi-session (6 sessions each). The final session (S6) contains the synthesized RESULT; earlier sessions are scratchpad/evidence. When metabolizing, start with S6 and reference earlier sessions for evidence.
- DC-203 Adjudicator responses: the file without a session number (`RESPONSE-ADJUDICATOR-PRAXIS_DEEP_INSPECTION.md`) is the final RESULT. The `-1` and `-2` files are session scratchpads.
