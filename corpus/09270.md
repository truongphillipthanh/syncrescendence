# Joseph Henrich: Cultural Evolution and the Collective Brain

## Executive Summary

Harvard professor of human evolutionary biology explains how cultural evolution—not individual intelligence—enabled human dominance. Key thesis: the "collective brain" (population size × interconnection × cultural transmission) drives technological progress more than individual cognitive capacity. Neanderthals had larger brains but lost to behaviorally modern humans who had better cultural institutions. Provocatively: human brain size has declined 10% in 10,000 years as we've outsourced cognition to culture. The Catholic Church's medieval marriage prohibitions inadvertently created the institutional conditions for the Industrial Revolution.

## Key Insights

### The Collective Brain
"If you have institutions that interconnect your population, you can maintain more sophisticated technology." Population size, network connectivity, and transmission fidelity determine technological capability more than individual intelligence.

### Why Europeans Starved Where Foragers Thrived
"They had guns, steel tools, and all these advantages, and yet they starved because they didn't know which plants were edible or how to hunt and trap animals in that environment." Knowledge accumulated over generations in the collective brain cannot be replicated by individual genius.

### Cassava Processing Mystery
A 10-step process to detoxify cassava cannot be invented through individual insight. "The genius of the process isn't individual insight into chemistry. It's that you have thousands of people, over thousands of years, making small adjustments and keeping track of what works."

### Brain Size Decline
"Human brain size has decreased over the last 10,000 years... by about 10 percent." Hypothesis: "We've literally outsourced functions to the collective brain and our culture. If the collective is handling memory, innovation, and decision-making, then there's less selection pressure for maintaining large brains."

### The Catholic Church Effect
Medieval marriage prohibitions broke intensive kinship networks, creating nuclear families and individual property rights. "These institutions became the foundations for markets and eventually for industrial capitalism." Unintended consequence: the institutional preconditions for the Industrial Revolution.

### AGI and Cultural Learning
"An AGI wouldn't have those limits [of memory and transmission]. It could store and retrieve vast amounts of information instantly." But: "An AGI might develop entirely different mechanisms for knowledge accumulation and transmission. So it might be superhuman, but in ways we can't easily predict."

## Quotable Passages

> "When Europeans encountered other cultures—Australian Aboriginals, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders—there were often assumptions of lower intelligence. But what was actually happening was that these people had different knowledge and different skills optimized for their environment and their culture."

> "The smartness that matters now is different from the smartness that mattered then."

> "The story is: the Catholic Church wanted to consolidate religious authority by breaking kinship networks, and that inadvertently created the institutional conditions for capitalism and industry."

> "Almost every single first invention of something big that we think is important for humans was invented in Eurasia."

## Integration Notes

- **CANON-00015 (Macroscopic Narratives)**: Collective brain as civilizational lens; cultural evolution as phase transition mechanism
- **CANON-00016 (Ontological Framework)**: Intelligence as distributed system property, not individual capacity
- **CANON-35000 (Wisdom Chain)**: Cultural institutions as crystallized wisdom; unintended consequences of religious policy
- Novel contribution: Brain size decline as evidence of cognitive outsourcing; Eurasia's "Lucky Latitudes" as collective brain advantage


## Transcript

Today, I have the pleasure of chatting with 
Joseph Henrich, who is a professor of human  
evolutionary biology at Harvard University 
and an author of two of my favorite books,  
The Weirdest People in the World and before 
that, The Secret of Our Success. And I was  
just mentioning to you that I remember reading 
this many many years ago when I was in college,  
and at the time, I didn’t think I would 
get a chance to ask you questions about  
it. But the most proximal reason I wanted to 
interview you is, I recently had your colleague,  
David Reich, on and we were discussing certain 
things in the record of human history where he  
said, “Eventually, you’re just gonna have to have 
Joseph Henrich on and ask him these questions,  
because he’s the one who would know.” So 
let me ask you one of the questions which  
I was super intrigued by which he raised, 
and we didn’t come up [with] an answer to. 
So one of the things he’s discovered through 
his genetic evidence is that 70,000 years ago  
across Eurasia, there’s so many different human 
species, from the Denisovans to the Neanderthals  
to the Hobbits, and then apparently, there’s 
this one group, which was potentially the size  
of 1 to 10,000 people in the Near East, which 
subsequently explodes, and now everybody who’s  
descended from Eurasia descends from this one 
group. And so I guess the question is like,  
what happened? What did they figure out?
A typical assumption when people think about this,  
if you put it in the Paleolithic, they assume 
that it has to do with some kind of genetic  
changes. Now, Reich’s lab, there’s no obviously 
big changes in the DNA, so it’s a little bit of  
a puzzle. Neanderthals, for example, had larger 
brains, and in primates larger brains usually go  
along with more computational abilities, more 
ability to solve problems. So the expanding  
variant out of the Middle East, out of Africa, 
might’ve actually been less able at an individual  
level to process information. But if you look 
back over the more recent period of human history,  
you can see that it’s a story of 
expansions of different populations. 
So for example, in Africa, we have the 
Bantu expansion about 5,000 years ago,  
which actually eliminates a whole bunch of 
hunter-gatherer populations that previously  
existed in Africa. We have the remnant populations 
in parts of the Congo, in the Kalahari,  
in the Hadza, for example, in Tanzania. 
If you look at the Austronesian expansion,  
so that’s the peopling of the Pacific, that 
was the expansion of one group of people at the  
expense of others, and of course, the Neolithic 
expansion into Europe is another example. 
So really human history is a story of these 
different expansions. And it could be that  
this expansion across Eurasia, which then led to 
interbreeding, so we know it’s the same species.  
Humans interbred with Denisovans and Neanderthals, 
as well as probably other species- there’s a ghost  
species in there. This could be just institutional 
changes, so if you have institutions, for example,  
that interconnect your population, you can 
maintain more sophisticated technology. And  
some paleoanthropologists, for example, 
have speculated- with some evidence- that  
the expanding populations had projectile weapons, 
so bows and arrows. And humans have periodically  
gained and lost bows and arrows in different parts 
of the world. So in Australia, for example, bows  
and arrows are never invented. In the New World, 
populations probably didn’t have bows and arrows,  
but then later develop bows and arrows.
It’s also really interesting how  
some technologies you would just think of 
as extremely… I don’t know what the word is,  
but the new world, like not having the wheel or 
something. I guess it kinda makes sense with no  
domesticated animals, but again, it’s like such a…
Right. Although the New World, everybody has dogs,  
and you can pull carts with dogs. So I’ve never 
really bought that, and of course, you can, you  
can use llamas in the New World to pull 
carts as well. People do that today. 
Yeah, so what’s your explanation for 
why there’s no wheels in the New World? 
So there were wheels on Mayan carts or 
on Mayan toys. My explanation is just the  
collective brain. So almost every single first 
invention of something big that we think is  
important for humans was invented in Eurasia. And 
Eurasia, as Jared Diamond famously pointed out,  
building on other people’s work, it’s 
the largest continent by far. It has the  
biggest population. It’s also oriented along an 
east-west axis, which allows ideas and people to  
more easily flow. And there’s a belt, which the 
historian Ian Morris calls the Lucky Latitudes,  
which runs from basically southern China all 
the way through to the Mediterranean. And ideas  
are just flowing back and forth there, across 
the center of Eurasia. But you also ended up  
with more complex state bureaucracies and the 
kinds of things that allow you to organize and  
move people around and whatnot.
And what’s the explanation for  
why the collective brain leads to state 
capacity? Or is it the other way around? 
Well, you can think of institutions that 
eventually lead to state capacity as just part  
of the innovative process of the collective brain.
So if you have more groups experimenting with more  
different ways of governing 
groups of people, gradually,  
you get the accumulation of the pieces that you 
can put together into different kinds of states. 
Got it. Okay, so going back to what happened 
70,000 years ago, is the basic answer like,  
it could be something like bows, but we 
don’t know exactly what it was? Or is it- 
Yeah. We definitely don’t know exactly what it 
was. So we know that this population expanded,  
and there does seem to be some tool indications 
to suggest more complex technology. Probably,  
technology usually goes along 
with social organization. 
So for example, if you look at Australia, which 
is a continent of hunter-gatherers, there’s an  
expansion about 6,000 years ago out of northern 
Australia which eventually takes up seven-eighths  
of the continent, and they had a new social 
organization, including rules about who you marry. 
You had linguistic exogamy, and rituals that 
interconnected populations. So rather than having  
local rituals and local myths, many communities 
would get together periodically to initiate the  
young men, and this would help bond that whole 
group. There’d be an exchange of technology,  
and teaching that goes on at these… they’d 
spent a few months in the same place so there  
was a lot of time for transmission.
And then in terms of mechanism, so,  
if it’s the case that you have these 
sort of convalescing waves of expansion,  
and David Reich’s lab’s evidence suggests 
that this expansion was quite violent,  
based on whether the genes are passed down through 
the maternal line or the paternal line. When you  
think about the mechanism in which technologies 
develop or these social institutions develop,  
how much of it is like, look, there’s all these 
different groups that are trying different things,  
and one of them maybe figures something out, and 
then they just kind of explode? And how much of it  
is that within each group, they are experiencing 
sort of accumulations of learning over time,  
and it’s not necessarily a selective process, 
it’s more of a sort of accumulative process? 
Well eventually the groups have to meet, 
and they’re gonna compete over territories,  
and a bunch of different things can occur. So 
groups can copy each other. So we know that  
from the ethnographic record and historical 
cases, sometimes a group will say, “Oh,  
those guys have really good technology 
tools.” Maybe they’ll get some migrants,  
or something like that, and then they can adopt 
the practices. So that definitely happens. 
But there’s also plenty of evidence of violent 
conflict. And the Reich labs evidence and lots  
of other ancient DNA suggests that there 
are these dead-end genetic lineages. So,  
I mean, the Neanderthals are a dead end in 
a sense, although we interbred with them,  
so they’re in us in some sense, but they don’t 
have their own pure lineage or anything like that. 
And if you had to guess, whenever this big 
wave happens, is it more of a sort of concrete  
technology? I mean, especially if you consider 
the range of expansion that can often happen,  
right? It’s like literally that same group goes 
from Siberia to England. It’s hard to imagine it’s  
a single technology lets you explore this wide 
range. But it’s also the idea that some cultural  
artifact is enough that it gets transmitted over 
tens of thousands of years and that’s what gives  
you the edge. I’m curious how you think about, 
what could possibly be this driving engine? 
Well the way I describe it in The Secret is that 
it’s a package of things. So another good example  
would be the Inuit expansion out of the north 
slope of Alaska. And they expand all the way  
across the Arctic and eventually get to Greenland. 
And they have a whole package of social practices  
which helps keep them interconnected, and then 
they have bows and arrows, which the group they  
are exterminating as they go along, the Dorset, 
doesn’t have. They have dogs and sleds. They have,  
along the coast they have boats, so they’re doing 
whaling. So there’s a whole package that puts  
together that allows them to out-compete 
and eventually exterminate the Dorset. 
And one of the things that happens, though, 
is the Dorset probably had better technology,  
but they expanded, they spread out, their 
languages diversified, they lost contact,  
and they began losing technology. 
So you wanna see this as a dynamic  
pulse. There were probably expansions and then 
collapses, another expansion, another collapse,  
right? It’s not one giant long march to victory.
And then this process, which has happened many  
times where the population gets cut off or 
something: When you say it’s a sort of cycle,  
is there some reason why, over time, 
that knowledge gets fragmented and breaks  
apart and populations disperse?
Yeah, I think there’s a cultural  
evolutionary dynamic that’s part of this, because 
languages will naturally diversify and then as  
they diversify, there’s less contact. People 
sometimes get inclined to marry endogamously,  
and especially if there’s enough people around 
locally, why go all the way over there? And those  
people are getting more culturally different, 
so they’re seeming a little bit like outsiders… 
So the tough part that humans have always 
had is to stay unified because of the  
natural effect of geography and learning 
locally is gonna tend to fragment us. 
In the Secret, you described this interesting 
startup problem where if you don’t have that much  
accumulated cultural knowledge, developing 
the ability to do social learning isn’t as  
valuable. But if you don’t have the ability 
to do social learning, you don’t have that  
much accumulated cultural knowledge in your 
tribe or group. So how is this problem solved? 
Yeah. So before I get to solving the problem, I 
just want to sketch for the listeners that the  
question is, why is this cumulative cultural 
evolutionary process that is so important  
for humans relatively uncommon in the natural 
world? It seems like just our lineage. I mean,  
there were a bunch of split-off 
lineages, but now it’s just us. 
So to understand that is this idea that you just 
mentioned, where you’re imagining an increase in  
brain tissue that’s gonna be costly, and I 
can put that towards individually figuring  
the problem out for myself, or I can put it into 
learning from others. And in a world without very  
much cumulative culture, there’s not gonna be very 
much useful information in the minds of everybody  
else so I should use that brain tissue for 
individually solving problems. And so it’s hard  
to get this runoff where their brains get bigger 
for the purposes of learning from others. And then  
the question is, how do you get past that valley?
So the case I make in Secret is that, say, three  
million years ago, two million years ago, there 
were several factors that came together. The first  
factor is the rate of change of environments. 
So you get this increase in the fluctuation  
of environments, so you’re getting more 
environmental changes. And in cultural evolution,  
a lot of theory shows that there’s a certain 
rate of change which is favorable to cultural  
evolution. It’s gotta be slow enough so that 
the information of your parents and the previous  
generation is useful, but not so slow that 
you might as well just encode it in the genes. 
So that’s one. Second thing is, we’re a 
ground-dwelling ape, which means we have  
hands like chimpanzees and gorillas, and we can 
potentially use tools and whatnot. But unlike  
them, our ancestors may have been savanna-dwelling 
apes, which meant we may have lived in large  
groups. So in mammals, mammals live in larger 
groups when they have to deal with predators  
and the predator guild in Africa at that point was 
quite thick. There were a lot of deadly predators. 
So paleo-anthropologists think that 
our ancestors may have lived in  
large [groups of] savanna-dwelling apes. And if 
you have a lot of individuals, if the culture is  
sparse, the bigger the group, the more chance 
that there’s someone doing something useful in  
the larger group. And so that means it’s easier 
to get across the threshold. So those are three  
of the main factors that might have allowed our 
lineage, as opposed to all the other lineages  
around, to cross this. We’re already a big-brained 
primate, we had hands, we’re living in these large  
groups on the savanna, and the climate changed 
during this period, so as to make us, yeah. 
And how big were these groups?
Well, I mean, nobody’s really sure,  
but maybe a few hundred individuals.
Okay. And before the agricultural revolution,  
was there still this transmission of 
information across different groups? 
Yeah. So lots of different evidence suggests 
that groups were moving trade goods. So well  
back into the Paleolithic we see trade. 
Often we see some genetic transmission. 
Right, the expansions and so forth.
Yes. And so, talking about the expansion,  
that’s something where the ancient DNA is 
useful because the Neanderthals in Europe,  
the DNA suggests they lived in very small groups. 
But the DNA of the expanding groups suggests a  
larger population. So those would’ve been two 
different collective brains there as well. 
So in The Secret, you discuss a lot of these lost 
European explorers with modern technologies as  
of at least a couple centuries ago encountering 
peoples who have for tens of thousands of years  
discovered ways of hunting and processing foods 
and so forth that, without which even these people  
with modern technology will starve. And as I was 
reading that I was wondering: I’m not sure how  
I understand the process by which, if there’s 
a 10-step process to making sure this bean is  
actually nutritious, and without any one of those 
steps, you might poison yourself or something. And  
at no point do you understand why this process 
works. You don’t have a scientific explanation.  
How do you even learn that in the first place?
Right. So one of the things we know, even in young  
children there’s a tendency to preferentially 
learn from healthier, more successful individuals.  
So if you’re processing it better- so something 
like bitter cassava, which has cyanide in it. If  
you just eat bitter cassava, it won’t taste 
great. So if you then rinse it somewhat,  
it’ll taste better and maybe you could eat it, but 
you’re going to accumulate cyanide over the long  
run. So it doesn’t kill you right away. But if you 
do this whole long process that the populations  
in South America developed, then you’re 
totally fine, you never get any accumulation. 
So you can imagine that initially this is gonna 
be very strong and people are gonna sort of do  
sensible things… but then it gets a little more 
mysterious. And we know this because bitter  
cassava gets transported to Africa, and Africans 
immediately begin eating it improperly processed  
and getting goitre and the cyanide processing that 
goes along with it. So then that’s gonna be a slow  
evolution where groups that do this are gonna be 
more successful and individual families are gonna  
be more successful. So, for example, you might 
have a household where they process the cassava  
more seriously than another family, and they’re 
gonna have more kids and they’re gonna be like,  
“Oh, that family’s really good.” And then 
people copy what they do in all kinds of ways,  
but one of them could be copying recipes.
Hmm. I guess it depends on the mechanism  
of selection here, because when you consider the 
different ways in which two different individuals  
might be different or two different households or 
even two different groups, I guess it makes sense  
why cyanide poisoning is such a deleterious effect 
that it is a noticeable or quite a strong signal.  
But I think you discussed some other ideas in The 
Secret where it’s like, the sort of spices in a  
region sort of match the antimicrobial properties 
or the antifungal properties you need to stay,  
I guess, clean or whatever in that particular 
region. But it sounds like a small effect,  
and how could such a small effect actually 
create a strong enough signal that when  
you’re deciding who to copy, you notice 
that this family is healthier because they  
spice their food in a certain way? Or this 
group takes over the area because they’ve… 
Yeah, I mean, it has to be a big enough 
effect to matter, but I think if you go  
back to a world where there’s a lot of improperly 
processed meat, people don’t have refrigerators,  
and the leading cause of death in children is 
diarrhea. People carry high pathogen loads.  
If you can knock that pathogen load down, we 
know from modern research if you wanna make  
people healthier and even smarter, right? IQ 
goes up if you knock the pathogen load down. 
Got it. So this process of cultural 
accumulation you’re talking about:  
you think it is not strong enough to pick up 
minor increases in fitness and it actually  
has to be quite a significant thing for it to…
I think it operates a lot like natural selection,  
in the sense that natural selection will pick up 
tiny things if you give it long enough. Cultural  
evolution will do the same thing if you give it 
long enough, because just small differences in who  
you’re paying attention to will affect things, but 
it might take 1,000 years as opposed to decades,  
right? But we know culture can spread adaptive 
traits super quickly if it’s a really big effect. 
Yeah. So the situation in which our ancestors 
found themselves, in some ways it’s sort of like  
epistemic hell, in the sense of you don’t know 
why certain things are working, but you do know  
that if you break with tradition, you might just 
doom yourself and your family. And that maybe,  
as you discuss, causes these religious beliefs and 
taboos and mystical understandings of the world to  
rise, where you just think like, “Look, you’re 
gonna burn in hell if you don’t do this 10-step  
process for refining your beans or something.” 
In some sense, this requires you to abdicate  
reason because you have to just be like, “I don’t 
understand this. this is the way it’s been done,  
so we’re gonna do it.” Basically: how much 
reason do you necessarily have to abdicate  
to survive in the ancestral environment?
I mean, one of the ways we research this  
is by going out to societies that make bows 
and arrows or have food taboos that protect  
them from dangerous marine toxins and ask 
them questions about why they do it and  
see if they [understand] and they don’t 
understand the underlying causal stuff. 
Right. But then why do they say they do it?
Well, a typical answer is, “It’s our custom.”  
or “It’s important to people around here to 
do it this way, so we do it this way.” So  
just Hadza bows, for example- I didn’t do this 
research, Jacob Harris and Kim Hill and Rob Boyd  
did it- but they asked Hadza about their bows and 
about how they work and what the mechanics are,  
so they understood some stuff. So you use the bow 
and you get some mechanical understanding. But if  
you asked him, “What if you used a different wood, 
different materials,” and they had never tried  
anything else but what they learned, how to make 
this bow. So they couldn’t speak to a lot of that  
stuff. And the things about the compression of the 
wood is very important- didn’t understand that. 
Okay, so that’s quite interesting, right? 
Because you would think that you have to  
transmit cultural knowledge over time, but you 
also need to experiment in order to innovate.  
But it sounds like because of the belief in these 
customs, you would be less inclined to innovate. 
Right. And the thing is, once something 
gets good, doing it differently almost  
always makes it worse. And then there’s also, 
some things are just different because people  
do it randomly different, like they make a 
mistake. So I think people often underestimate  
the power of error in generating novelty.
One question I have is why this process of  
cultural learning… So humans have extended 
childhoods, presumably to give us more  
time to accumulate culture, and then we live after 
menopause, presumably because older people, our  
grandparents, can teach us about the situation we 
find ourself in. And 18 years is such a long time,  
and when I think back to- I mean, obviously I 
didn’t grow up in the ancestral environment,  
but when I think back to what I was doing as a 
teenager I don’t think I was learning that much. I  
was just less productive for no obvious biological 
reason. So I guess I don’t intuitively understand  
why this process of cultural learning takes 
decades, and why it can’t happen more rapidly. 
Well, you probably, as an adolescent, 
were in school, right? So you were  
probably accumulating some stuff in school- 
maybe. And here’s an interesting fact about  
hunters. So anthropologists who studied hunters, 
hunter-gatherer societies in different places,  
and the physical peak that at least males have is 
in their early 20s, right? That’s when they run  
the fastest. They got the best eyesight. But the 
best hunters in the community are 36 to 40, right? 
They’re not as fast as those guys, but they just 
know, they know the track, they know the animals,  
they know exactly what to do in these different- 
And then hunting skill begins to decline because  
basically the physicality of things begins to 
catch up, and so there’s this kind of cycle.  
And at 18 young hunters aren’t even producing 
enough food to feed themselves. So it’s not  
until they get into their 20s that they’re 
actually in surplus and bringing food home for  
everybody else. And you need to know hundreds, at 
least, animals, you need to know animal behavior,  
you gotta be able to spot tracks and spoor, 
and we’re just very knowledge-dependent in  
terms of our hunting and gathering.
Yeah. Given what you just said and  
also the experience of these European explorers 
suggests that you just gotta know a lot of shit  
to make it in any sort of environment on Earth. 
But then, there’s all these other animals and  
they seem so dumb and they seem able to get by. 
So why did humans have such a hard time of it? 
Yeah, well, so I think we offloaded a lot 
of stuff into culture. So in one of my Lost  
European Explorers, there’s a case where they’re 
in Australia and they have camels. And the camels  
escape, and now central Australia has lots of 
feral camels. So the camels survived the lost  
European explorer challenge, because they 
have innate instincts. They can smell water  
a mile away. They can detoxify foods in their 
own- they have a complex digestive system that  
detoxifies- we’ve lost all that, and we’re 
worse than chimpanzees at detoxifying foods  
because we have all these cultural practices 
that do the work. So we’ve externalized  
detoxification and a lot of digestion, actually.
I had this independent researcher and internet  
writer called Gwern Branwen on my podcast a 
couple months ago, and we were discussing AI.  
And I asked him- so his theory is very much like 
the brain became bigger, more intelligence. And  
so then I asked him, “Look, if it’s this simple, 
why did it take so long for evolution to discover  
intelligence in the first place?” And he had this 
interesting answer, which is that in terms of the  
signal that evolution is giving you, there’s a 
very narrow gap between skills that are so useful  
that they should just be distilled as an instinct 
into your genome, and then skills that are so  
worthless that are not worth learning in the 
first place. And so this narrow gap that’s like,  
you need that generalization ability. It’s not so 
primal that, you know, you’re not gonna culturally  
learn hunger, it’s just gonna be in your genome. 
I don’t know if that sounds like an interesting  
explanation or helps explain anything.
Well in cultural evolutionary models,  
a typical thing would be to let genes compete 
with individual learning to compete with cultural  
learning. And it turns out the rate of change 
of the environment affects that. So if the  
environment is changing slowly, then you should 
put it all in the genes. And if it’s changing  
at moderate speed, then culture is the best 
way to go, and if it’s fast, then individual  
learning. And the idea, the individual learning 
is favored because if it’s changing too quickly,  
the previous generation doesn’t know anything 
worth knowing because the world you’re dealing  
with is just so much different from their 
world. And so it’s this intermediate range. 
So myself and others have argued that the 
increase in the frequency of change during the  
Plio-Pleistocene transition 2.5 million years ago 
is a change that increases the value of cultural  
transmission of learning from others. I’m not sure 
what your guest was thinking. I mean as our brains  
are not very good at solving problems, otherwise 
the lost European explorers could survive. And  
human brain size has been declining for the last 
10,000 years. So we’ve actually been getting  
dumber. Fewer neurons, less computational power.
Why has brain size been declining? 
Well, the collective brain argument suggests 
that at a certain size, you’ll begin farming  
off specialists. So because there’s a store 
of knowledge in the society, and we can all be  
generalists and learn how to do all the different 
skills. But at some point it makes efficiency  
sense for us to specialize in different skills.
In order for that to be the case though, we have  
to have social agreements of some sort that allow 
us to trade or exchange things like that. So,  
but then once we’re specializing, we don’t 
necessarily need as large a brain and we, because  
we distribute the overall brain power amongst the 
society. So it could be that we’re becoming more  
of a superorganism. And you see the same thing 
in ants. When ants get specialized occupational  
casts, their individual brains shrink.
Yeah. I think David Reich’s lab had a  
result a month or two ago where they showed that 
the selective pressure on at least the European  
samples, which is the samples they studied, 
was that there’s been selection for greater  
intelligence over the last 10,000 years. I don’t 
know if you saw that or what you make of that? 
Well, they didn’t say anything about intelligence. 
They did use the polygenic score for education.  
But there was no education 8,000 years ago.
Which is correlated, right? 
Yeah, it’s correlated. But then the question 
is, we don’t know what goes into that,  
right? Is that actually computational software? 
I mean, people do well in school because they  
stick to it and they can sit in the 
same place for long periods of time. 
I guess it would be interesting for them to 
sort of deduct the docility hit polygenic  
score from the education, because we don’t 
have a polygenic score for intelligence yet,  
right, so which is why you need some proxy.
Well there are IQs, so there are polygenic  
scores for IQ. I think they actually did that 
one as well, like you said, it’s correlated with  
education. But the things that go into giving 
you an IQ, I mean, the correlation between  
brain size and IQ is only about, well, across 
populations it’s .24, so it’s not very big. 
The other thing is IQ is massively misunderstood, 
so the way to think about IQ, which has been going  
up over the 20th century, by quite a bit, so if 
you rescale modern scores to 1900, it’s about 70,  
it’s called the Flynn effect. I think that 
those are cognitive abilities for navigating  
the institutional world that we’ve constructed.
And a huge mistake would be to assume that  
those are the right cognitive abilities for 
the next century. So it’ll be a different  
constellation. We study herders and cognitive 
abilities of herders in northern Namibia,  
and if you’re in northern Namibia, you gotta be 
able to move through the landscape, so being able  
to just pick a direction and know where you’re 
going and not get lost is super important. 
So different suites of cognitive abilities 
are favored in different environments. This  
idea that there’s this generalized 
thing applicable across all human  
environments just doesn’t… I mean, education 
massively increases your IQ, right? If you’re  
uneducated, you have a totally different IQ.
And then is the way in which your horsepower  
is directed, is that a thing that you think is 
basically set by the time you’re an adult? Or,  
if somebody’s 30 now and the AI thing is gonna 
happen next and they have to totally reorient  
away from knowledge work, is that a thing?
Well, I think it’s a continuous scale. If you  
look at human brains, they’re developing and 
continuing to add new connections and stuff,  
at least into the mid-20s. Now, there could be 
even more plasticity after that. Unlike chimps,  
we’re still not totally myelinized for 
our whole lives.
So there's definitely room. It’s just there’s less room.
The kind of social learning for which our
learning biases are fit, right?
Like where you pay attention to elders
because they survived somehow 
and they’ve accumulated the knowledge
from past generations,
how much do you think that
actually basically applies
to the way in which the modern knowledge
work economy accumulates knowledge?  
And how much do you think is just an artifact of the 
kind of environment our ancestors found themselves in?
Right now we’re in Silicon Valley, or in 
San Francisco, and it’s very common here for  
a 20-something to make a new product or service 
which, without that much- they don’t have that  
much context of how the world works, but they 
can make big, big innovations and big changes.  
But at the same time, people on average maybe are 
more productive in their 40s and 50s in terms of  
wages or something. So basically, this sort of 
social learning you’re describing, how much does  
it actually describe the world as it exists today?
Yeah. And so, super important, so we’ll take the  
patent database and if your same-sex parent- has 
to be same sex- patents in a particular domain,  
you’re nine times more likely 
to patent in that same domain. 
And how do you separate the genetic 
versus cultural effect there? 
So these are very fine domains, so we’re talking 
about, like, natural adhesives versus synthetic  
adhesives. So unless you think there’s genes 
for that. And same thing with transistors  
and electronics, so very fine domains. And if you 
grow up in Silicon Valley, you’re much more likely  
to patent, in general, but you’re probably gonna 
patent in computers. But if you grow up in Boston,  
it’s gonna be biotech. So having a father or 
mother who did biotech and then growing up in  
Boston, you’re even more likely to patent in 
biotech. And this is true even if you move to  
New York. So if you look at people in New York 
who are from Silicon Valley and from Boston, the  
Bostoners are more likely to patent in biotech, 
and the Silicon Valley kids are more likely to  
patent in computing. So all the same rules apply.
Well, I’m not sure because maybe the location,  
you learn a lot from the environment. 
But the fact that it’s just kids, and so,  
if you think these old rules of cultural 
accumulation and collective brains apply,  
you would think, “Ah, you’re 50 by the time you’re 
writing your first useful line of Python code or  
something.” When in fact, a lot of these big 
innovations come from people who are much,  
much younger, before they should have accumulated 
much of the know-how that this theory implies. 
So the model here is what to focus your 
efforts on, so it’s the throwing model.  
So if you grow up in Silicon Valley, 
you focus your efforts on learning how  
to code or whatever. And so that means that’s 
where you’re likely to make the innovation. 
Right. But in terms of, you know, when there’s 
2% growth a year and a lot of the technologies  
that are dominant in the economy today, or a 
lot of the industries, didn’t even exist many  
generations ago. Basically, does that suggest 
this model of- should we just mistrust our  
instincts of who to give prestige to and what 
kinds of people we want to pay attention to,  
whether it’s professors or elders or whatever?
Yeah, so that’s definitely something I’ve thought  
about and I wrote about in Secret, which is that, 
as the rate of cultural change gets faster- and  
we sort of talked about this with environmental 
change- the value of older and older members of  
the previous generation declines because the world 
that they grew up in, and that they honed their  
skills to, is quite different from the current 
world. So you would expect the degree to which,  
I mean, optimally, you would look less 
far back or you would look to relatively  
younger individuals to get your inspiration 
from because the world they adapted to is  
closer to the world you’re gonna need to adapt to.
Yeah. And speaking of Silicon Valley, let me ask  
you a little bit about AI. So one of the reasons 
to suspect some incredibly sharp discontinuity  
from the world as it exists today to a world with 
AIs. And by AI, I don’t mean just, like, GPT-4,  
I mean, like, replacement at least for anything 
you can do on a computer screen, the AI can do. 
One of the reasons we expect this hard 
discontinuity is that they have potentially  
the step function increase in social learning and 
the ability to accumulate knowledge that maybe  
humans had, or the magnitude of which maybe 
humans had when, between them and non-human  
primates. And in particular, the fact that you can 
just copy everything you know. Like you don’t have  
to teach a young person, right? The constraints 
of biology mean you can’t just replicate brains. 
You have much more efficient communication. 
You don’t have to communicate through words,  
you can just shoot your brain state across, the 
population size can grow arbitrarily large. So to  
the extent of, the collective brain is the size 
of the population and how interconnected it is,  
do you just expect we wouldn’t even 
recognize the kind of world these AIs  
could make as a result of their cultural skills?
Yeah. No, I mean, I, I definitely think it’s  
pretty interesting, and holds great potential for 
expanding the collective brain. There are little  
things in there which might make one worry. 
So if you study the history of innovation,  
you find out that, for example, serendipitous 
meetings are super important. There’s a great  
paper on Silicon Valley showing that companies 
will cross-reference each other’s patents more  
likely when the people at those companies tend 
to frequent the same coffee shops, and they  
track people on their cell phones and stuff to 
figure this out. So serendipitous meetings are  
important and improper copying. So a huge number 
of innovations are mistakes where somebody copied  
incorrectly and then got something better.
I read this interesting theory that maybe  
evolution designed transcription and translation 
to have more errors than it could otherwise have,  
just so that you can have this sparse reward 
when you’re close to the right sequence. 
Yeah, yeah. I think that’s a very interesting 
area of research, and it makes good sense to me. 
I’m not sure of the current state of the 
evidence, but there are… Different parts  
of the genome are more or less susceptible 
to mutation, which is kind of interesting. 
Yeah. So going back to AI, maybe then 
another way to phrase it is, look,  
you’re talking about these serendipitous meetings 
where you can learn something another person  
knows. And the great advantage these AIs have 
is that they can sort of meet with everybody at  
once. Future versions of AIs, you could really 
imagine holding the whole internet in context,  
right? I mean, we’ll be the equivalent of those 
people isolated in Tasmania according to the AIs,  
right? Because they just have everything in 
context. You can get a PhD in every single field,  
and you can amortize that across all your copies.
Yeah, so are you sort of banking on, in the next  
10 years, you’re just gonna be living in 
the singularity or something because of your  
belief in the value of cultural knowledge?
Yeah, I see there’s various potentials,  
and I’m particularly interested in using AIs to 
augment problem-solving in human groups. So you  
can imagine getting the humans together because 
the humans have the big advantage of having stuff  
they care about, right? There’s stuff they 
want to invent. So the AI is still a tool  
at some point. So I’m interested in that, but 
I’m interested in how these things like running  
out of training data is gonna be dealt with, 
the value of making mistakes and serendipity,  
if you get rid of all those things or how you’re 
gonna reintroduce them, those kinds of things. 
Yeah. I mean, it’s quite funny because until 
recently, people were saying the big issue  
with LLMs is that they hallucinate 
and make mistakes. And at some level,  
hallucination is no different than creativity.
Well, may- maybe there’s a way to harness that,  
right? But maybe we just 
didn’t know how to harness it. 
That’s right. What do you make of the idea 
that you could have AI firms or AI tribes,  
whatever way to think about it- is if the 
effective population size that can communicate  
with each other is such an important contributor 
to how much progress a group in history was able  
to make. If you could just literally run billions 
of AIs and they have this immediate ability to  
communicate with each other. And again, I’m not 
talking about current models, I’m talking about  
future, human equivalent. Basically I guess 
I’m just throwing out a bunch of different  
intuition pumps and I’m curious which one you 
find most promising or most interesting, or did  
you just find all of them not as convincing?
Yeah, no, I don’t have strong opinions about  
any of this, but I do think that one thing 
in order to make all that work is, humans  
are constantly getting hit with shocks, right? So 
there’s economic shocks, there’s weather shocks,  
there’s conflict with other groups, there’s 
pandemics. And the shocks have big effects on how  
things go. They inject new information into the 
system. So I’d worry about a system that is too  
homogeneous and doesn’t have enough noise adding 
shocks and new challenges and things like that. 
One of the things missing from our conversation is 
the kind of creativity that cultural evolution has  
figured out. So to give you an example, at some 
point in human history, religions invented big,  
powerful, moralizing gods. And this may have 
increased the people’s ability to cooperate.  
So forget about the technological element. Some 
of the most important features of innovation  
over human history have been institutional 
and things that get people to cooperate. 
So in my work, I argue that one branch of 
Christianity resulted in the transformation  
of the families in European societies into 
small monogamous nuclear families. I’m  
not sure an AI would have thought of that. 
Cultural evolution thought of it because of  
how it affected how the societies operated, 
so it sorted this out over historical time. 
Yeah. Can I play with that idea?
Yeah. 
Because that’s quite interesting. So again, I 
think this might even reinforce the advantages  
of AIs in this sense. So, to the extent that 
this sort of random fluke by the church led  
to this modernity and the great divergence 
or whatever, and it was a result of, there’s  
a bunch of variation, and then you can select 
over some group that’s doing the right thing. 
The advantage you have with AIs is that you 
can have much more high fidelity replication  
of culture and you can explore a wider range of 
potential cultures. Sorry, and it sounds really  
vague when you talk about AIs in this way. So 
what do I mean? One problem companies have today  
is that, suppose a company’s working really well. 
Maybe it’s early Apple, or early Tesla, or SpaceX  
or something. And suppose it has to do with the 
culture, the people, something, it’s not clear  
how you replicate that culture, not only across 
different institutions, right? If I’m running  
a company, I don’t know how to copy SpaceX. Not 
only can you not replicate it across institutions,  
you can’t even replicate it across time.
So over time, many institutions tend to decay,  
their culture fades as people leave or die or 
something. And then imagine if all of SpaceX,  
at least maybe at the time you 
thought it was the most effective,  
are just AIs where you know every single byte, 
and when you can make a copy of it 1,000 times,  
and you can put it against every single hardware 
problem we have in the world. And then you can,  
if you think there’s another team that might 
have some different culture which is better,  
you can do the same thing with them. And culture 
here includes not only how they think about  
their work, but also even how does the board make 
decisions, right? Do they do this Monte Carlo tree  
simulation? And there’s so many different things 
you could do here. So because of the wider range  
of possibilities you can explore and the fact 
that you can have higher fidelity transmission  
of cultural information, maybe the ability 
to do this random evolution also increases.  
But I’m curious to get your take on that.
Yeah, as a kind of broad sketch, I think that  
is pretty interesting. I worry about too high a 
fidelity replication just because it’s important  
to take the details of historical context 
and time into account. So that same thing,  
if you fix it, it might not really work a decade 
later when everything else around it has changed,  
right? So it’s kind of a moving target. 
But you could fix that just by having  
lots of different variants that are different 
versions of that. So yeah, that would be cool. 
Sorry, that gives us a good opportunity to go 
into WEIRD. But before we get there, one more  
question about before the agricultural revolution. 
You know, obviously many groups around the world  
were different and many of those differences 
were probably inspired by the fact that they  
were living in different environments, so they 
needed to come up with different technologies  
and adaptations to survive best there. How much 
just random differences that had nothing to do  
with their environment do you expect there to 
have been, in terms of… I don’t even know what  
the right category would be, but in the modern 
world, you might imagine something like, does a  
society have slavery or not? And maybe pre-modern 
societies all had slavery, so that’s not the right  
way to think about variation, but that kind of…
Yep. So I think there’s lots of reason to think  
there was lots of variation. And one of 
the ways that researchers study this is  
they look at ethological variables 
and they compare it to phylogenetic  
variables. And here they mean cultural phylogeny.
So if your ancestral populations had matrilineal,  
matrilocal social organization, how likely are 
you to have it, controlling for ecology? And it  
turns out both of these things matter. People 
adapt to their ecology, but you can still see  
the signal of past society. So some degree of 
fidelity of transmission of social institutions,  
how we make our baskets, those kinds of things. 
There’s lots of examples in the modern world,  
and we see this all over the place. So if you 
look at gender inequality in the modern world,  
you find that a history of the plow leads 
to greater gender inequality. So males had  
a particular advantage in using the plow 
because it requires upper body strength. 
This meant males became the dominant force in 
economic production at the household level. And  
that even today in populations where most people 
aren’t farmers, this persists. So this is cultural  
persistence that has to do with whether you had 
the plow. So this is work done by Alberto Alesina  
and Nathan Nunn. A former postdoc of mine now 
at the Harvard Business School, Anke Becker, has  
done a similar thing with pastoralism. So if your 
ancestors were pastoralists, and pastoralists, for  
various reasons, have quite strong gender norms 
that persists into the modern world and still  
shapes, for example, female entrepreneurship.
Interesting. Yeah, and the reason I’m especially  
curious about this is because it informs the 
following question. If the Industrial Revolution  
didn’t happen in Europe but started somewhere 
else, how different would the world look like  
today? So obviously you discussed the fact that 
breaking apart these kin ties was necessary for  
the Industrial Revolution, but to the extent that 
was necessary, whichever place had the Industrial  
Revolution first would have had that, right? But, 
I mean, separate from the technologies or cultural  
practices which were necessary for the Industrial 
Revolution in the first place, still how different  
would the world look? How much variation 
was possible given our level of technology? 
Yeah, I have a lot of trouble trying 
to answer that because, I mean,  
China or some place in the Middle East might 
have been the obvious alternative place for  
the Industrial Revolution to happen. But 
I feel like you have to give those places  
a lot of stuff that developed only in Europe.
So for example, universities begin spreading in  
the High Middle Ages. So you’d want them to have 
universities. You’d want them to have universal  
schooling, which began to spread and wasn’t 
present in these places prior to that. So that  
begins to spread in the 16th, 17th century. 
And so by the time you add all this stuff,  
it basically starts to look a lot like Europe.
And these are all things that are global now,  
right? So the universal schooling that 
we find around the world today, you know,  
begins with the Protestant Reformation in Germany 
and then later England. University’s models  
are the European university, and globalized.
I guess one obviously very salient example of  
variance which might not have been replicated, 
but I’m curious if you think it might have been,  
is, it seems like the British Empire was 
the first major institution which decided  
that slavery is just morally wrong and we’re 
gonna throw our weight around to eliminate it.  
And I don’t know if you think that sort of 
naturally follows the development of social  
technologies that the Industrial Revolution 
would have brought about, but that seems super  
contingent. But I’m curious if you disagree.
Yeah. Well, so my story is that the rise of  
the Industrial Revolution in Europe 
has to do with the consolidation of  
Europe’s collective brain. And one of the 
things that requires is trust in strangers,  
and at least the beginnings of moral universalism. 
And it’s that moral universalism that eventually 
causes the British to say, “We’ve got to stop  
with the slave trade thing.” It’s a moral decision 
that they made because it’s no longer consistent  
with the changing moral values over time.
Right, right. Okay, so we’ve been dancing  
around the thesis of your book following The 
Secret, which is The Weirdest People in the World.  
And before we really jump into it, maybe you can 
give me a summary of what the thesis there is. 
Yeah. So the first observation is that there’s 
a great deal of global psychological variation  
around the world. So European, American, 
Australian populations tend to be highly  
individualistic. They’re inclined towards 
analytic thinking over holistic thinking.  
They have a lot of impersonal prosociality, so 
trust in strangers. They’re against conformity,  
willingness to cooperate with strangers. So 
the question is, how can we explain the global  
variation in these features of psychology?
And towards the end of the book,  
I actually connect these features of 
the psychology to economic differences,  
including the Industrial Revolution that happened 
in Europe, which reshapes the world. And the  
story is that the key event is the spread of 
a particular form of Christianity into Europe,  
where the Catholic Church- what becomes the 
Catholic Church- systematically dismantles  
the intensive kinship systems in Europe, 
leading to small monogamous nuclear families. 
And this transformation leads to the creation 
of new institutions. So by the high Middle Ages,  
you get the rise of guilds, which are voluntary 
groups of craftsmen and self-help societies,  
because people don’t have their families to 
rely on. People begin moving around. There’s  
occupational sorting into different occupations. 
You get urbanization rising. Charter towns are  
on the rise. Universities pop up. New kinds 
of monasteries pop up. And then Europe begins  
to urbanize, and you get new kinds of law that 
are based around the individual. Contract law.  
And then eventually this leads to a lot 
more innovation because ideas are flowing  
around Europe and then eventually the Industrial 
Revolution. So that’s the argument in a nutshell. 
Can you explain again what exactly 
the Church did which led to the  
kin-based existing system breaking down?
Yeah. So the Church outlaws polygyny,  
and so that stops elite males from having multiple 
wives and concubines and whatnot, and creating  
kind of a giant family through that. It outlaws 
cousin marriage going all the way out to sixth  
cousins at some point, and that included spiritual 
kin and other kinds of non-genetic relatives as  
well as the cousins. It frees up inheritance, so 
it has inheritance by testimony rather than normal  
patrilineal inheritance. And a simple example 
here is in most societies, you inherit access  
to land corporately, which means you and your 
brothers and stuff all own the land. And it might  
be your uncle is actually in charge of the land, 
your father’s brother. And so you can’t sell it,  
you can’t move it around, and you’re also tied 
to it. It’s where your ancestors are buried,  
and so there’s this big importance of land. So the 
Church allows people to give land to the Church,  
the Church becomes the largest landowner in 
Europe, because you can do it by testament. 
So those are just some of the examples of the ways 
it transforms the family structure, and eventually  
you get these monogamous nuclear families which 
are basically unheard of around the world, at  
least if you look at the anthropological record. 
And you can really see this when you can compare,  
individuals can move to European cities as 
individuals or nuclear families. In China when  
you move to the city, you maintain contacts 
with the folks back home in the village,  
and people flow back and forth and you get these 
little enclaves of different clans and stuff in  
the cities, the connections. And this is 
really important because your ancestors,  
and there’s rituals that have to be done 
back in the home community. But Christianity  
does away with all those ancestor rituals.
Okay, great. Let’s jump into it by starting  
before- much before- even the church. I wonder 
how much of the things that make Europe weird  
existed even in antiquity. If you read about 
how Roman society worked, or how these Greek  
polities worked, already you have an emphasis on 
nuclear families. You have these sort of universal  
norms around, “Hey, we believe in republicanism,” 
or, “We believe in democracy.” And the structure  
of the system matters more necessarily 
than… I guess at least before the empire,  
right? So yeah, was Europe already weird 
before the things that its church did? 
Well, there were certainly some interesting things 
going on in Greece and Rome. But I don’t think  
there’s good evidence that you had the kinds of 
monogamous nuclear families that you would find  
later. I mean, even European law is built around 
patrilineage. So if your father’s still alive, you  
are not a full citizen. You’re in the pater house 
of these large families. Definitely intensive  
kinship, for sure, patrilineal, patrilocal.
Women, of course, don’t have any rights.  
And republicanism, but the formation of Rome is 
built around a series of elite families. So it’s  
a clan operation, and they call it republican 
because the clans all have some say in what’s  
going on. So people sometimes see representative 
government where it’s not really individuals being  
represented, but families. And so this fools 
a lot of people into thinking there was a lot  
more individualistic voting and things like that, 
whereas there’s actually no voting. So in Greece,  
in Athens, Athens is unique because it does 
a bunch of things in the laws of Solon,  
that break down the intensive kinship. So for 
example, in Greece, you get monogamy for the  
first time, and Athens is considered unusual. 
So males can only marry one Athenian woman,  
which has potentially positive effects among the 
competition among Athenian men, but they can have  
as many slave concubines as they want. So when 
Christianity spreads, it ends the whole slave  
concubine thing, which was also common in Rome, 
and that’s another effect on this whole thing. 
Yeah. But I guess the extent to which these 
practices were already formed hundreds or  
thousands of years before the church’s 
intervention, maybe this suggests that  
Europe was already on this trajectory and the 
church didn’t necessarily move the needle that  
much. Or what do you make of that thesis?
Well we know that the… in the book, I talk  
about data where we can look at contemporary 
kinship practices, and we can look at the  
number of centuries that that part of Europe 
was under the church… so we have a database of  
the diffusion of bishoprics, and there’s a clear 
connection between the intensive kinship practices  
and the number of years under the church.
Hmm. And then if you think about what the  
church basically did, I think your work is often 
used to justify this idea of Chesterton’s Fence,  
where if you don’t necessarily understand a 
cultural practice, you should keep it around  
because… the stuff we were talking about, The 
Secret, where you don’t understand why the 10  
steps lead to the bean being edible, but you 
should trust the sort of wisdom of the ages. 
If you think about what the church did here, 
right? Like, isn’t this sort of like a… not  
necessarily a justification, but at least an 
example of just breaking down Chesterton’s  
Fence? The church doesn’t really understand 
why these kin-based networks that have existed  
for thousands of years might have utility. It 
still just gets rid of all of them. And that  
results in this lottery ticket that leads to 
The Great Divergence. So is there evidence for  
anti-Chesterton’s fence from the Weirdest People?
Sure. Sure. So what you’re talking about is just  
the idea that culture has imbued institutions and 
various practices with a logic that we might not  
understand. So it’s not calling for never changing 
the institutions. It’s saying make sure you figure  
out the logic and the cost and benefits.
So I was an expert witness in Canada for  
the attorney general of British Columbia, 
asked the Supreme Court of British Columbia,  
whether the statutes against polygyny were 
legal. And so my job was just to inform the  
court that polygyny has this unfortunate effect 
of the elite and high-status males tend to get a  
disproportionate share of the wives, and that 
creates this pool of low-status unmarried men. 
Now you can decide what you want to do with that. 
But you need to understand the kind of underlying  
social dynamics that you’re gonna unleash 
if you legalize or decriminalize polygyny. 
Right. But again, going back to the Church, the 
Church didn’t understand the positive or negative  
effects they’re gonna have, right? They just like, 
“Let’s rip the Band-Aid, let’s see what happens.” 
That’s right. And it actually benefited 
the Church because it released people’s  
responsibilities to their families and allowed 
them to migrate in and join the Church, and more  
heavily invest in the Church. And these later 
prohibitions against priests marrying and stuff  
was all an effort to get greater investment in 
the Church, because you weren’t torn between  
helping your son and then investing in the Church.
Hmm. And then that end result which benefited the  
Church, was that their conscious intention 
in breaking apart these kin-based ties? Or  
was that just the accidental byproduct?
Yeah, I mean, in the record, I’ve never  
been able to find much evidence that they were 
thinking about the destruction of kinship ties.  
There is a great quote from Saint Augustine 
where he talks about the benefits of forcing  
people to marry more distantly. But, you know, 
this is something that was debated repeatedly in  
church councils all across Europe. And 
it doesn’t seem to pop up very often. 
And the Church doing this, for obviously selfish 
reasons, was that in any way related to why the  
Church spread through Europe in the first place? 
Or did it end up spreading for separate reasons  
and it won out over the other potential religious 
competitors for separate reasons? And basically,  
was this part of the selective mechanism 
which allowed the Catholic Church to  
become dominant in Europe in the first place?
Yeah, I think so, although it’s hard to know.  
There was a lot of randomness going on in the 
diffusion of the Church. But also as the Church  
arrived, these places, over a period of time, 
became more successful. So you can see rising  
urbanization in the wake of the Church’s 
arrival. That would have meant more trade,  
their citizens’ rights began developing because 
they were trying to attract citizens to the towns.  
That would have given the Church more cachet, 
ability to move. There’s also the appearance  
of these voluntary associations which are new 
kinds of monasteries. And so the monasteries  
begin spreading throughout Europe. But they’re all 
linked in a network because, like the Cistercians,  
they’re all connected and they have big meetings. 
So they’re actually spreading a lot of knowledge  
around Europe as well. So that’s part 
of this kind of collective brain story. 
And if you compare what’s happening in 
Europe at this time to the rest of the world,  
so starting with China: in 1500, the population 
of England, where a couple centuries later the  
Industrial Revolution starts, is three 
million, and then in Ming dynasty China,  
it’s somewhere between 100 million to 160 million. 
And if we take your previous perspective of the  
size of the collective brain really matters 
a lot, the size of the collective brain in  
China just seems so much bigger. So what is 
the best way to understand what went wrong  
here? Why weren’t they able to use their…
Right. So when you’re thinking about China,  
the first thing to remember is that for 
a lot of the history, we can actually  
see that size difference mattering a lot.
So a lot of European invention, or a lot of stuff  
used in Europe, is flowing in; gunpowder, paper, 
printing press, stuff, is flowing into Europe. And  
so okay, so then what happens after about 1000 
CE? Well, the argument is that the destruction  
of the kinship group opens the floodgates to 
people moving around. So a recent analysis that  
we’ve done is, after a bishop arrives at a 1.5 by 
1.5 grid cell in Europe, people begin flowing in  
and out of that grid cell more. And what we do to 
calculate that is we have a big database of a few  
million famous people. And we have birth and death 
locations. So we find out that the Church arrives  
and suddenly people are free to move around.
So you have a flow of individuals around,  
and you have rising urbanization. So Europe 
passes China around 1200 in the percentage of the  
population that lives in cities. And cities are 
where a lot of the action is, cities and towns.  
And you have the diversification of occupations. 
So normally clans would specialize in different  
crafts, and you’d learn from your clan brothers 
and clan fathers how to do the occupation. In  
Europe you get guilds, and you get masters and 
apprenticeships developing where strangers will  
become an apprentice to a master, learn from him, 
move somewhere else as a journeyman, learn from  
that master, and then eventually set up a separate 
shop. Lots of opportunities for a flow of ideas. 
So it has to do with how the kinship 
system transformed the movement of people,  
the rising of urbanization, the nature of 
guilds, and then eventually you get universities  
and things like that. So it greatly intensifies 
the interconnectedness of the collective brain,  
and the amount of cognitive diversity.
What do we know about India during this period?  
Because from what I’ve read, from a perspective 
of how much written history we have, it’s kind of  
a black box. But we know that there was trade 
between India and other parts of the world,  
and we know it had a big population. Do we know 
why India before the Mughal period or before the  
British period wasn’t… yeah. What was the effect 
of not having maybe Abrahamic gods or.. with the  
kind of other cultural practices India had?
Yeah, definitely not an expert on this one,  
but some of David Reich’s evidence suggests 
that the caste system is quite old. Because  
you can actually see it in the genetic system. 
And the caste system is not good for innovation,  
because if you happen to be good at another 
skill but your caste doesn’t do that skill,  
you can’t switch over. So it’s gonna prevent 
the sort of available genetic diversity.  
Complex families, intensive kinship, there’s 
reason to think that those things were all  
important. Yeah, so, patchwork of polities.
But there was lots of interesting ideas,  
actually, that are developed in India, and they 
move into Central Asia, eventually end up in  
the Islamic world, and then get into Europe. So 
for example, Arabic numbers are actually Indian  
numbers. Zero was probably developed… I mean, 
Indians were huge with numbers. It’s kind of  
interesting. Perhaps related to the religion.
Not that this would be a justification for the  
caste system, but is there any 
way in which the specialization  
it engendered would be good from the perspective 
of this collective brain perspective? 
So specialization is good. And so the interesting 
thing about most human societies is specialization  
automatically- or not automatically- it tends 
to evolve along some kind of kinship line. So  
in Oceania, there were different clans. In 
each clan, there’d be like a canoe-building  
clan and a warrior clan. So that allows 
specialization, but it doesn’t allow you  
to harness the genetic diversity, because 
it’s not like the canoe-building clan had  
special canoe-building genes. It’s just that 
you would pass down this cultural knowledge. 
Now, a better system, but it seems hard to 
evolve, is one in which we all opt, select,  
into occupations in which we think we’re good 
at. But for that world to exist, you need a  
world of voluntary associations with emphasis 
on the individual rather than on the group.  
So this is the world that evolves in Europe, 
once you demolish the intensive kinship units,  
because otherwise you’re gonna get castes and 
clans and all these things we see elsewhere,  
where we see a division of labor, but it’s 
transmitted through a kin network, the knowledge. 
And why wasn’t there another sort of stultifying… 
because we began the conversation by talking  
about, there does seem to be this cycle where 
over time, because of cultural differences,  
because of kin, whatever else, over time groups 
will tend to diverge. Languages, culture, other  
things you mentioned, tend to diverge over time. 
Why didn’t the same thing happen in Europe where,  
let’s say, in the third century or fifth century, 
the Church starts doing this stuff, and then by a  
thousand years later, if you’re part of this guild 
or whatever, now that’s become like the new kin,  
and now there’s actually less mobility again?
Well, so there was a lingua franca, Latin,  
and so intellectuals would all write and 
communicate in Latin for a long time. So  
even though they were speaking different 
dialects of French and German and whatnot,  
they were able to communicate in Latin. And 
Christendom basically formed an overarching  
network that helped. And one of the key things 
that this world religion does, and other world  
religions do it too, is you have to marry other 
Christians, but it dissolves the tribal line. 
So Europe has tons of tribes in the 
pre-Christian world, but because of  
how you have to marry other Christians, you had, 
you know, Celtics marrying Franks. And in fact,  
the early arrival of Christianity into England 
is when a Frankish princess is marrying an Angle  
in Kent. And so they’re marrying back and 
forth. And this is gonna dissolve the tribes  
because intermarriage, “what’s the kid?”, you 
know? So that’s how you get rid of the tribes,  
but you need a world religion to do that.
Right. And so it seems like there were two  
very important features that were relevant here. 
One, it seems like obviously the competition  
between different European groups which gave 
incentive for monasteries or universities  
or cities to attract the best people and 
make all these advancements. But secondly,  
the fact that they were descended from a common 
empire, from the Roman Empire. Basically, in a  
world where the Roman Empire never existed, do you 
still have this collective brain in Europe emerge? 
So I think the Roman Empire plays a big role, 
because, for example, there were Roman roads in  
parts of Europe which allow people to flow. And 
you have communities which were part of Rome and  
relatively sophisticated. Now, they go into a 
bit of decline, but there’s still the memory of  
the empire. So, you know, Charlemagne wants to 
be crowned emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in  
800 even though there’s not very much left of it.
But it was still an ideal, and that Carolingian  
Empire actually had real effects because they 
worked with the pope in order to enforce a lot  
of the marriage and family programs. And the 
Carolingians had their own agenda because they  
were trying to use these marriage and 
family practices to weaken some of the  
other aristocratic families. But they had the 
religious tools that they could put to work,  
and if you didn’t have those religious 
beliefs, then you couldn’t put them to work. 
Sometimes people defend ancient conquerors 
based on a similar idea of they spread  
knowledge around the world, and they set up 
these lines of communication. People say that  
about Alexander and then causing Hellenistic 
expansion and trade and so forth. They say  
that about Genghis Khan and the Silk Road. They 
say… I mean, obviously this led to the Black  
Plague, so… so it’s tough where that nets out.
They say that about Napoleon and the Napoleonic  
Codes and so forth. Where do you basically 
come out on that story of: have the great  
conquerors been good for the collective 
brain or bad for the collective brain? 
Well, I’ve never actually focused on that. 
I mean, I guess my immediate reaction was  
there must be a better way to transmit 
the knowledge than the whole conquest. 
And then I guess there’s also the open question 
of how the disruptions that are caused by them…  
How much did they set back the-
And population decline, spreading  
disease and stuff, so certainly 
it could have been done better. 
Right. And going back to David Reich’s work, If 
your theory implies that there should have been  
a decrease in genetic similarity in Europe 
as of, after the fifth century or something,  
as a result of the culture, the Church’s 
practices, do we see that in the genetic record? 
Yeah. Yeah, so Europeans are quite well 
mixed compared to other populations. And  
so we were talking about India. You know, 
if you do a principal components analysis  
of this two-dimensional plot of the genetic 
similarity you can actually see the class,  
and people are pretty spread out. If you put the 
Europeans on the same plot, they’re well mixed. 
Right. But do we see the period of greatest 
mixing starting in the fifth century? 
Yeah, good question. I don’t know the answer 
to that question. So that would be… That’s a  
nice piece of evidence, so… You know, there’s a 
couple of groups working on medieval ancient DNA,  
so hopefully we’ll have more answers on 
that question. I mean, there is enough  
now of pre-Roman burials, so Bronze Age type 
stuff, showing that early Europeans definitely  
had complex, intensive kin groups, patrilineal, 
patrilocal resonance kinds of stuff, polygyny. 
And then stepping back, I’ve read there’s 
so many different theories of the Industrial  
Revolution and of modernity. And there’s Robert 
Allen, the economic historian who thinks it’s a  
result of higher wages because of the Black Death. 
There’s Gregory Clark, who thinks it’s because of  
this positive eugenics in England where the upper 
classes were having more babies. I mean, there’s  
like 20, 30, probably hundreds of different 
theories of why it happened, where it happened,  
and when it happened. And so each one of these, 
when I read them, sounds plausible. I don’t have  
a knockdown argument against any of them. But I’m 
not sure how to think about which one is correct,  
and yet, if we’re stacking all of these up 
against each other… why you think this story  
is any more accurate than any other story 
that people tell? Is it overdetermined? 
Well, I mean, the first thing to think about 
is, those other authors- possibly Greg Clark  
is an exception, but they don’t think about 
the psychological variation that exists. So  
there’s good reason to think there’s all 
these psychological differences, and you  
have to believe they don’t cash out. And if you 
think they exist, then you have to explain them,  
and so you need a theory that explains them. 
So Bob Allen, he’s a blank on the psychological  
variation. So let me give you some evidence that 
I think is pretty good evidence. So we have a  
database of the diffusion of Roman bishoprics 
through Europe. And then what we do is we look  
at what happens when a bishopric arrives. And 
I mentioned before, you get a flow of people. 
But another fact is, if you look 
at the production of famous people,  
these places where the bishopric has arrived start 
producing more creative individuals relative to  
non-creatives. So there’s an uptick, and it keeps 
going up for centuries, so the relative increase,  
and so that suggests you’re producing more authors 
and inventors and writers and whatnot. And then if  
you take each of those, and you correlate it with 
modern patents, places that spent more time under  
the church produced more patents between 1980 
and 2014 based on European patent data. And this  
holds if you just compare regions within the same 
country. So you can see long-term effects of this,  
and you can see immediate effects in the 
historical record on the production of creatives. 
So what would you make of a theory that says, 
“Look, all of these theories are basically  
correct. All of these stories are basically 
correct.” And it’s them stacking up that leads  
to the Industrial Revolution rather than any one 
of them being the most important proximal cause.  
And maybe there’s reasons, like, let’s say there’s 
10 of these stories and you had to stack them all  
up and China had five of them, but they also 
had maybe independently, like three other ones,  
but they also had two stories which go 
against them or something. And it’s like,  
no one of them is that proximately important, it’s 
their combination, right? So, I guess your theory  
seems compatible with Robert Allen’s that coal 
being cheap and wages being high was important. 
Well, I guess one of the things that I think is 
a mistake is to focus too narrowly on England,  
because England was benefiting from ideas that 
were flowing in from France. There was a lot of  
great science being done in France. And, I don’t 
think Gregory Clark’s right. I can explain almost  
everything he explains with cultural evolution, 
and he doesn’t even really take that seriously. 
Oh, interesting.
Yeah. So patience,  
one of the things he argues is patience. In WEIRD, 
I use the exact same data- I actually get the data  
from him- to show that you have this increase in 
patience. But we know that people can culturally  
learn patience, and this can all be culturally 
transmitted, and in this world, it leads to  
more success. So if you’re the kind of person who 
doesn’t waste a lot of his money and we begin to  
value thrift and stuff, which Protestantism does, 
then we should expect there to be an increase in  
fewer murders and lower interest rates.
What’s the reason to think that… I mean,  
his main explanation, I think is genetic, right? 
Is there some reason to think that that is less  
likely to be as important a factor as culture?
Well, we know that populations- migrants- into the  
US and Europe shift their psychology over a few 
generations of being there, and we know there’s  
been natural experiments done by economists 
like Chris Blattman where you actively try  
to teach people, train them essentially, to 
discount the future less. And that seems to  
be culturally transmittable. So this suggests 
that- I can’t rule out that there’s been any  
genetic evolution, but I can show that culture 
can operate on this quickly and powerfully. 
Right. I think one of his key pieces of evidence, 
I don’t remember the exact numbers on this or even  
the particular detail, but it was something 
like if you look at the inheritance of wealth  
or titles or- I forget what the exact thing is- 
the correlation across generations points to the  
kind of pattern you would see with genetic 
inheritance rather than cultural spreading. 
Yeah. He doesn’t actually fit any cultural 
evolutionary models, and if you include that  
people are learning from parents and learning 
from their social milieu, your parents determine  
where you are in the social milieu, so you’re 
surrounded by people who are being more patient  
and behaving in certain economic ways, then 
that’s gonna have a huge effect. I just told  
you about how if you grow up in Silicon 
Valley, you’re gonna patent in computers.  
It’s not because you have genes for computers.
Yeah. Given the persistence of these cultural  
effects, how should that change how we 
think about whether it makes sense to  
have more immigration from societies that are 
already WEIRD or whether that matters or not? 
Right. So we have a paper under review right 
now in which we show that from the 1850 roughly  
to 1940, a big driver of US innovation both 
the quality and quantity of patents, is the  
cultural diversity of counties. And we actually 
use immigration as a kind of way of showing the  
causal effect of this. So what you want is a lot 
of cultural variation. Now, if you get people from  
societies that are more distant from whatever 
the current US culture is at the time, it’s  
gonna take more time until they’re able to fully 
integrate. So if they’re coming from [a] very  
distrusting society, they’re not gonna be able 
to latch into the collective brain immediately. 
So you see this in around 1900. There’s data from 
people, mostly coming from Southern Italy and  
coming from Germany and Britain, and the Southern 
Italians are coming from a society that has a high  
distrust of strangers. So their immediate effect 
on the patenting system is low. But the strength  
of these cultural traits seems to go down by an 
order of magnitude each generation. So the second  
generation, you can still see where they came 
from, but they’re a lot more like the majority  
culture than their parents. And then it goes down 
another order of magnitude. So yeah, so you just  
have to do more work essentially to assimilate 
people, enculturate them. But the potential value  
of having diverse ways of thinking, different 
ideas, can be really valuable, I think. 
What do you make of, so Garett 
Jones is an economist who has this,  
he calls this spaghetti theory of assimilation. 
I don’t know if you’ve heard of this. The  
idea is basically, look, immigrants do 
assimilate, but they also assimilate us,  
and so whatever cultural practices they have will, 
in proportion to their size of the population,  
have an effect on wherever they migrate to.
And his example is when Italians came to America,  
spaghetti, which is traditionally an 
Italian dish, also became an American dish,  
right? So they assimilated American culture 
as well. And sub in traits like trust or  
whatever there. Basically, this sort of 
reciprocal assimilation has implications  
of whether we want immigration from non-WEIRD 
societies. What do you make of that idea? 
I think that the spaghetti example or the pizza- 
pizza or spaghetti, both good examples- is a  
great thing, right? Because American food is 
a fusion of cuisine from lots of societies,  
and that leads to quite good food. Same thing 
you can see [in] music. Things like jazz come,  
have African rhythms in them. And so 
rock and roll is along that lineage of- 
But we don’t want, like, do we want the 
diversity in low trust and high trust? 
Well, the question is, do social interactional 
traits operate the same way as these things?  
And if you have ethnic enclaves, then you’re 
gonna get low trust in those ethnic enclaves.  
You get things like the mafia, right?
So you don’t want that. But if you had  
an immigration policy that distributed 
people, and in a high-trust society,  
you benefit by being higher trust because you can 
do things like collaborate and start companies  
and stuff, which you have to be high-trust to 
do that. Otherwise, you don’t do it in a very  
effective way. So there is a pressure for 
low-trust people to become more high-trust.  
But if you’re in mostly high-trust people, 
there’s not an incentive for you to move down.  
And social interactional traits are 
different than things like food types. 
In psychology, there’s been this problem of 
the replication crisis where a lot of the  
main results are hard to replicate and it’s 
not clear how much of this is real science.  
Have you looked into how many of the WEIRD 
results are based on, of the differences  
in psychology between different populations and 
so forth? How much of that actually replicates? 
Yeah, my sense is it replicates quite well. 
So we published our paper in 2010, and in, oh,  
late 20 odds, Armin Falk, who’s an economist, 
and a bunch of others, Ahnke Becker, Ben Enke,  
published a paper where they measured economic 
preferences in 80,000 people around the world.  
And that just showed big variation in things 
like patience, various kinds of reciprocity,  
altruism, so the kinds of things we 
would expect. And then other large-scale  
projects have similarly shown lots of variation.
The groups we have today, which are not WEIRD,  
when you study them, do you think that the 
fact that they have resisted modernity for  
so long suggests that they actually are weird in 
their own way? Which is to say that this is not  
representative of the way that Europeans might’ve 
been thinking in the second century; rather it’s  
like the Hadza’s particular weirdness leads them 
to be averse to modernity in a way that is unique? 
Well, that’s always a concern, and it’s especially 
a concern when you’re studying hunter-gatherers  
because a lot of the hunter-gatherers that are 
left in the world today are [in] places where  
agriculturalists couldn’t easily move to.
So that’s something we’re thinking about  
all the time. The ways around that are to 
go to places where agriculturalists didn’t  
go or couldn’t go. So we have a lot of good 
ethnographic history on people in Australia,  
and then we have the Arctic populations, which, 
you know, big sections of Paleolithic Europe were  
probably kinda like Northern Canada is today. So 
at least environmentally it’s not crazy, because,  
you know, Ice Age Europe. And places like the 
Aleutian Islands, the West Coast of California,  
we have lots of ethnographic evidence, 
and that there was no agriculture there. 
So just putting together all these different 
lines of evidence help us develop a picture.  
I wouldn’t wanna bank everything on the Hadza. 
Of course, we can’t do experiments with some of  
those groups. But we can see whether the Hadza 
look like these other hunter-gatherer groups. 
Oh, speaking of the Ice Age: do you have a 
take on why before the Ice Age agriculture  
didn’t develop even though genetically there 
probably weren’t that big a difference between,  
like, 20,000 years ago versus 10,000 years ago?
Yeah, I don’t have a clear picture of that. It  
is the case that the Holocene was a particularly 
long stretch, a particularly long interglacial.  
There were some long interglacials, but the 
soonest one before that was 120,000 years ago. 
Other than that, they were getting broken up. I 
sometimes wonder if we may someday figure out that  
there was actually a little bit of agriculture. 
And it would’ve all been destroyed by the Ice Age,  
right? So it’s not clear that there would be 
any heritage of it left. So we would have to  
find some remnants of some domesticated crops.
Although I was asking David Reich about this,  
and I forget the reason he said, but he did say 
that if there were societies before the Ice Age,  
we would have evidence of them in 
the archeological record or their  
genetic record or something like that.
Yeah, if they had gotten to any scale. But  
we know from modern societies, 
there are groups, for example,  
in the Amazon that have root-based agriculture 
that wouldn’t leave any archeological record. 
This is a question I also asked to David 
Reich. There’s, you know, with modern  
LMs and just generally with newer techniques for 
processing information and understanding evidence,  
there’s a potential for answering questions 
that maybe we couldn’t have done before,  
especially from maybe a cultural perspective 
where you can actually consider lots of different  
cultural artifacts at once in the context of you 
can run cultural simulations or something. Maybe  
those are more fanciful ideas, maybe there’s more 
practical ideas. But if there’s one question you  
have which it’s sort of bottlenecked by having the 
right data or being able to process the data the  
right way and future LLMs or AIs could help us 
there, does something immediately come to mind? 
Well, this gives me a chance to tell you something 
we’ve been working on. So we were talking about  
this kinship hypothesis, the idea that kinship 
intensity affects psychology. And when I presented  
the ideas that are in The Weirdest People in the 
World, I get hard times sometimes from historians  
who will have some kind of very European-specific 
story about why this happened that has to do with  
European royalty or coal or something like that.
And so my move is to not try to get into the  
weeds and start reading Latin texts, but to go 
test it somewhere else. So if it’s true that  
kinship intensity should work like this, then 
we should be able to test it somewhere else.  
So we have a large corpus, two different corpus 
from China. And so we have late-imperial China,  
something called the Gazetteers, which were 
produced across the prefectures, and they had  
a stylized content. So this is the same genre, 
thousands of books, and then we have about 7,000  
books going back 2,000 years in Chinese history. 
And the techniques that the AI is allowing us to  
do is to get measurements of psychology from 
the texts. So we take a questionnaire. This is  
a technique developed by my post-doc, Mohamed 
Attari. We take a psychological questionnaire  
that’s been validated, it’s in English, and 
we wanna get an equivalent in ancient Chinese. 
So we run it through a semantic similarity 
comparison, and we look for quotes from the  
ancient Chinese corpora that match each 
sentence in the English corpora. And then  
we rebuild the questionnaire in ancient Chinese. 
So that’s our psychological measure for something  
like individualism or collectivism or moral 
universalism. And then we take each book or each  
paragraph in each book, and we do a comparison, 
cosine similarity comparison, between the two  
sets of text there, and that allows us to stamp 
each paragraph with a measure of individualism  
for example. And then we do that for the entire 
corpora. And this allows us to track psychological  
change across space and time in China. And then we 
can correlate that with kinship intensity, and we  
get the same correlations that we do in Europe.
Interesting. How worried are you about the fact  
that, if you think about modernity, was a result 
of finding this one cultural variant- at least  
according to your story- which then helps us 
develop the better technologies, all these  
new institutions and so forth. How worried 
are you about the fact that the modern world  
because of the spread of WEIRD, has just much less 
cultural variants and because of this monoculture,  
a potential variant which might be useful 
in the next transition just wouldn’t emerge? 
Yeah, I am worried about that, because just 
the destruction of languages. So we’re losing  
languages left and right. English has a particular 
form that you don’t find in lots of languages,  
so that’s just an example of the kind of cultural 
diversity we’re losing. So that’s definitely a  
worry. I do think that we’re getting new variants. 
Japan adopts a lot of WEIRD institutions. But it’s  
really creating a new third unique thing. It’s 
got a bunch of Weird elements, but Japanese law,  
despite being the same as the US, operates 
very differently. So unlike Americans,  
Japanese don’t tend to sue each other and they 
tend to use mediation and things like that,  
even though the superficial law is pretty 
similar. So I do think there is creation of  
novelty which could be useful. But yeah, in 
general, I worry about the loss of novelty. 
I also should say that I think that the sort of 
impersonal world of impersonal institutions in  
WEIRD psychology is quite fragile. For example, in 
the US in rural areas, you see moral universality  
declining since 2008. This is based on John 
Haidt’s YourMorals.org data. And so there’s  
an increasing difference in the morality of 
urban areas versus rural areas in the US. 
Hmm. I’m sure you get asked about this a lot, but 
fertility seems to be declining around the world,  
and there doesn’t seem to be any existing 
cultural variance, other than maybe the Amish,  
who can resist it. Do you have takes from a 
cultural anthropologist perspective of what’s  
happening here? And a follow-on question here 
is, should we really encourage these cultural  
enclaves like the Amish to the extent that 
this anti-fertility meme is so viral that  
they can’t be part of the common culture and 
still preserve fertility, you really need  
this closed-off societies in order to preserve 
fertility. How seriously do you take that idea? 
Well, I definitely take declining fertility 
pretty seriously. And especially if you’re  
a collective brain guy like me, just having 
fewer people is gonna be a big problem. And I  
think that there will be spread of ideologies or 
religions or something which are pronatalist, and  
those groups will have a big advantage in cultural 
evolution because a community that is pronatalist  
tends to produce more pronatalist babies.
Christianity spread using that. Mormonism  
spread in the 19th century using that trick. 
So I just feel like cultural evolution is gonna  
find the combination and there’s gonna 
be some pronatalist groups spreading. 
There are a lot of different societies in 
the world today. Is there some explanation  
of why none of them have the existing 
variants necessary to keep fertility high? 
Well, from a cultural evolutionary perspective, 
this is relatively new, right? So the demographic  
transition is only really late 19th century. Lots 
of the world is just getting hit after 1970. And  
we also have things like rising female labor 
force participation which is gonna stifle it,  
rising female education. And so once that 
stuff maxes out, then you’ll see variation  
among different groups in terms of the 
number of babies they produce, right? 
And this thing unfolds in demographic time scales, 
so we’re not gonna see it for a few generations,  
but there’ll be some group somewhere that 
will be producing more babies than everybody  
else. And the reason why I think religion is 
the likely one is because people do things  
because they think God wants to do it. And if 
people come to think that God wants them to have  
more babies because it’s a way of worshiping 
him or getting to heaven or whatever their  
religious configuration is, then that’ll be 
a group that produces more babies. I mean,  
Catholics were defying the demographic transition 
for a while. They just seem to have stopped. 
Right. How worried are you about the fact that… 
I mean, you discuss in WEIRD that throughout this  
period in European history, European states are 
at war most of the time. How worried are you about  
the fact that, because of a decline in war between 
great powers, that this build-up in cultural  
mutational load that you were talking about or 
maybe where things just get less efficient over  
time and there’s no selective pressure to get 
rid of that inefficiency. How worried are you  
about that just making governments or nations 
less efficient over time because there’s no  
outer loop loss function that says if you mess 
up enough your country might not exist, or your  
group might not exist? Which we were talking 
about the waves of Yamnaya or the Anatolian  
hunter-gatherers just conquering everything. If 
that doesn’t happen, will we just see culture  
and nations and governments degrade over time?
I think the answer to that is yes. The one way  
that countries or whatever the political 
institution is could address that would be  
doing this thing that I’ve curiously called 
“domesticating the competition”. So sports  
teams constantly renew themselves by competing. 
Firms live and die and renew themselves over  
time. Like you said, companies will start 
off being super great and then they get too  
big and then they get kind of inefficient 
and then eventually they disappear. None  
of them last forever. And that seems to be 
true of political units. But in principle,  
you could have at least some renewal processes. So 
democracy potentially provides a renewal process,  
although there are things like the institutions 
that the government builds that are hard to renew.  
So one simple political idea is I think when 
you create a new department, it should have  
the same thing that cells have where at a certain 
time, they time out and you gotta make a new one. 
And that’s because just the way human 
bureaucracies, institutions work is  
they kind of corrode from the interior, from the 
inside, just the way cancer spreads in a cell. So  
you just gotta kill it and make a new one. So we 
could institute that. But I guess the idea hasn’t  
quite caught on yet. I mean, there are bits and 
pieces of it around, so it’s not like it’s unused. 
Yeah, I guess maybe the thing that’s less 
understood or is not appreciated is that  
the reason that over time in history 
institutions have improved is because  
of the selective process that at least at 
certain levels of selection no longer exists. 
Yeah. I mean, the Roman Empire didn’t 
say, “You know, we gotta redo everything.”  
“Why not adopt democracy and we could have a 
republic.” Nobody does that. Things fall apart. 
The researcher Stuart Armstrong has this idea 
called Chesterton’s metafence. And here’s what  
it states: In our current system, democratic 
market economies with large governments,  
the common practice of taking down Chesterton’s 
fences is a process which seems well established  
and has a decent track record and 
should not be unduly interfered with. 
Can you say any more about what the author has 
in mind? I would like an example or something. 
Yes. So I think this is a rebuttal against this 
common idea that we shouldn’t be arbitrarily  
changing- like suppose a new technology 
comes about and we’re worried about the  
risk it might pose to society. Suppose the young 
kids are doing something different culturally and  
we’re worried about like what effect that 
might have on the culture and so forth. 
He’s basically saying, “Look, this has been 
happening for five centuries and this process  
by which new cultural variants enter the mix 
and so forth has worked really well for us,  
even if it’s happening at a rapid clip 
and we shouldn’t interfere with it.” 
Well I don’t think I have strong feelings 
on this. I’m always focused on trying to  
understand the process of cultural evolution, 
and it is true that people often resist cultural  
change that in retrospect we think is good. 
But of course when you begin to make cities,  
you lead to all kinds of epidemic diseases. So 
if you’d anticipated that, you might have worked  
on some of the public health procedures before 
you built the cities. So foresight can be good. 
Right. I guess the sort of bigger question here 
is, it makes sense in the kind of environment our  
ancestors faced why they’d have intuitions against 
progress, because if you already have technologies  
that are well fit to the environment, any 
change is likely to be deleterious. And whether  
we find ourselves in a world that’s different 
enough where we can just, very intentionally  
disregard our worries about changes in culture or 
technology, or whether it’s similar enough that we  
should actually… I mean, there’s two ways you can 
interpret The Secret, right? One is, “Oh, look,  
this is why we should care more about culture” 
and so forth. Another is just, “Oh, wow, they’re  
living in such a different world. I understand 
why my intuition against progress- where it comes  
from, and now I can totally disregard it.”
Right. So I would say that the lesson from  
Secret is not to disregard it, but just to 
be cautious because we could be dismantling  
things that are really important for the 
structure of society. And you shouldn’t  
just dismiss valuable cultural practices as the 
relics of a medieval age, or the relics of a  
pre-enlightened age or something like that.
So ritual is a good example because rituals  
seem to have real psychological benefits in 
binding people in community and helping develop  
self-regulation. But it’s easy to be an atheist 
like me and say, “Ah, rituals are stupid. We gotta  
stop doing them.” Turns out they’re doing a bunch 
of stuff and if you don’t wanna lose that stuff,  
you gotta figure out another solution.
A question that arises in my head is,  
look, we began this conversation talking about 
all these societies in the past, even when they  
figured out something successful, they did not 
themselves know why it was successful and so they  
just had to ascribe it to custom. They just say 
like, “Oh, this is the way we always made bows”  
or hunted or something. Why think that we have an 
answer for why the Industrial Revolution happened?  
Why think it’s any different than the Inuit trying 
to explain why they make their bows a certain way? 
Oh, you mean, how or what 
we’re up to is different? 
Yeah.
Well, I mean, we’re trying to  
apply science, which has been very successful 
in all these different areas. So, you know,  
evidence, and we all put out our arguments and we 
go through the process and some evidence is better  
than others and that’s just our epistemology.
And I’m interested in the cultural evolution  
of epistemologies. So societies have varied 
over time in what counts as good evidence  
and what counts as a good argument. So one 
of the psychological changes that we see  
emerging in Europe compared to other places 
is how important is what the ancients say. 
So in lots of societies, if someone says 
something and you can say Aristotle or  
Confucius didn’t believe that, then it’s like, “Oh 
gosh, I guess I’m sunk.” Whereas at some point,  
Europeans decided, “Actually who cares what 
Aristotle thought. We know a lot more than  
he did.” So this is a big epistemological 
change. And then the emphasis on empirical  
evidence in science is not something you find 
in earlier traditions within Europe, and it’s  
quite variable across different societies.
So you should think about the very standards  
by which we count a good argument and good 
evidence is itself culturally evolved. 
Yeah. And how much do you worry about the lack 
of cultural variation in science in particular,  
where we have like one big institution, the 
NIH, which funds most science. And there’s  
similar processes of consensus and peer review and 
whatever, that educated whether you get a grant,  
whether work is accepted, whether it’s considered 
worthy scholarship and so forth. Should we think  
that maybe we should have more variation in those 
methods because maybe the scientific method isn’t  
complete, there’s epistemic tools could be 
improved or it could be different and so forth? 
Yeah, absolutely. So polycentricity. There should 
be lots of difference, competition amongst these  
groups, no single funding sources… lots of 
different priorities. One thing I point out in  
this book I’m working on is that scientific 
papers tend to be more impactful when the  
authors are from more diverse societies.
But interestingly, people are biased  
to work with people from their own 
society. So what we actually do is  
different than what would maximize innovation.
I’m sure you’re gonna address this in the book,  
but I’m already curious now. It seems like the 
internet hasn’t been as big a deal as somebody  
who’s thinking from this zoomed out collective 
brain picture might have anticipated in the  
’90s. Maybe it’s boosted the rate of innovation 
somewhat, although it’s not clear just looking at  
growth rates or productivity growth rates 
or something that it has. Why didn’t the  
internet cause the equivalent of another round 
of urbanization in our ability to do research  
or economic productivity or so forth?
Yeah. And that’s something I’m really interested  
in figuring out. And one thing that I’m still- 
I don’t have a full answer to this question,  
but one thing that is clear is that there’s 
something special about face-to-face interactions. 
So something like whether even in the 21st 
century, whether two cities have direct long  
haul flights between them or direct flights 
between them increases the flow of ideas  
between those places. But we know these places 
are connected by the internet, whereas that  
effect doesn’t seem as good. And part of this 
is that people have to build trust, probably,  
before we start sharing ideas. And the more 
different someone is from us, the more you need  
that trust. So some of the research suggests that 
this effect is even bigger when places are more  
culturally different. And this is interesting, 
because they’re probably more valuable to each  
other when they’re more culturally different. But 
that’s then the face time and being in the same  
place is even more valuable. So that’s the kind 
of direction I’m going. And also, I still think  
that there should be exactly what you said, 
which is that the internet should have caused  
more innovation. I’m just not satisfied that we 
fully determined the best way to figure that out. 
You had a very interesting chapter in Weird 
where you talk about… a lot of innovation  
through history is more serendipitous than we 
imagine, and it’s the result of the collective  
brain being big enough to discover these things. 
But if you look at the sort of track record in  
science and research, there do seem to be certain 
individuals who make independent discoveries  
across many different fields that are each quite 
important, your Newtons and Einsteins and John von  
Neumanns and so forth. And if it was just the 
result of the right person is in the right lab  
who sees the right observation at the right time, 
this repeated excellence by certain people seems  
less explainable. So I’m curious if the collective 
brains theory can explain what’s going on there. 
Right. Sometimes I’m interpreted as saying 
that there are no genetic differences among  
individuals, [I] definitely think there are 
genetic differences among individuals that  
affect their likelihood. But I think when we 
take the individual, we often import into our  
thinking about them the person’s life history. So 
for example Einstein, when he was a patent clerk,  
so he wasn’t succeeding as an academic, he and 
his friends got together in something called  
the Olympia Academy, they called themselves, 
which was just a group of, like, five people,  
who would get together and they would read the 
interesting books at the time. And if you look at  
the books that they read, and historians have done 
a lot of work on this, all the major ideas that go  
into special relativity were read and processed by 
the Olympia Academy before they do it. So the idea  
that people think that time is relative; well, 
people were kinda talking about that, and they  
were talking about multiple dimensions. And like 
Henri Poincaré, at the same time, comes up with  
the same equation as Einstein, but he doesn’t give 
it as radical an interpretation as Einstein does.  
He was thinking of the equations as kind of fudge 
factors, trying to make the math work. So there  
was an almost simultaneous invention of special 
relativity, and the ideas were all circulating.  
And Einstein happened to be in a place which 
allowed him to put all those things together. 
As a patent clerk, he was actually processing 
devices to synchronize trains in different parts  
of Europe. And so he had to think about the 
amount of time a signal coming from different  
parts of the world. And there were a bunch of 
these. And we know the patents that went through,  
and we know that he had to look at these, there 
were only two guys. So he happened to be in a  
particular place and time in terms of the ideas 
circulating and what he was doing on a day-to-day  
basis that really did give him an edge. Now, 
you could then say, “Well, what about general  
relativity?” Well, there were a couple other guys 
who were probably gonna get general relativity.  
And Einstein himself was worried that he was 
gonna get scooped, because once you get the one,  
it’s just a matter of- I mean, it’s not “just” a 
matter of figuring out, the math is really hard.  
But there were a number of other people 
who probably would’ve gotten the math. 
Yes. I guess then there’s also still the 
question of why, in 1905, Einstein himself  
discovers not only special relativity, but 
Brownian motion and the two other things,  
right? But I guess you would just say it’s 
the result of he had the right reading group? 
I mean, obviously he’s a special individual. 
Although he did spend the whole second half of  
his career trying to show why quantum mechanics 
was wrong. So his Brownian motion paper is  
foundational in quantum mechanics. But then he 
decides God doesn’t play dice with the universe,  
and he doesn’t like the stochastic nature of 
quantum mechanics, which has more or less proved  
true, and it’s part of our modern technology and 
stuff like that. And he spends the whole second  
half of his career fighting it. So that’s a 
case where his intuitions didn’t serve him  
well. And he turned out to be wrong for decades.
And, sorry, I think that’s also a case in which  
your point about having the right ideas 
available to you is important, because,  
obviously I don’t know much about this, but from 
what I understand, the people who believe in the  
many worlds interpretation believe that Einstein 
was on the right track, and he just didn’t  
have this idea of the ever-ending multiverse 
available to him, which would’ve explained his… 
That there’s this branching 
thing, and just a matter of  
figuring out which branch you’re on.
Right. And so there’s no probability. 
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Okay, so we were just discussing,  
look, Einstein was reading the right things 
and making sure he had enough context to come  
up with these big discoveries. You’re somebody 
who has connected ideas across many different  
fields. How would you describe the input function 
for the way in which you come up with new ideas,  
and how much has it been informed by… I mean, 
you were like, you started off as an aerospace  
engineer, and you’ve done anthropology across 
so many different societies, on fieldwork and  
so forth. How do you basically think about 
the Joseph Henrich production function? 
Yeah, I mean I try to implement the ideas of the 
collective brain. So in my lab at Harvard, I have  
post-docs and graduate students with backgrounds 
in evolutionary biology, psychology, anthropology,  
economics. I mean, some of my favorite 
collaborators are economists. And we’re just  
bringing ideas from very different places, but 
across the social sciences and even the biological  
sciences, we’re often trying to explain the same 
kind of phenomena, economic decision-making,  
cooperation, things like ethnicity, why does it 
exist, stuff like that. So the way we silo science  
is a big problem, and especially in the social 
science, I think it’s even a bigger problem. 
So I’ve been a professor of anthropology, 
psychology, economics, and evolutionary biology,  
and just even the standards of evidence and 
what constitutes good research and how you  
tackle a problem really varies. So the academic 
disciplines are like different cultural worlds,  
different tribes, and just pulling the best 
from them has kind of been my approach. 
And among the more polymathic scholars, do you 
guys have, I don’t know… do you and David and  
a couple of the other ones in this category, is 
there some shared group you guys have, or, is it… 
No, it’s a series of different networks. So 
David Reich and I, for example, are always  
talking about how we wanna read culture from the 
genes. So if humans have had a long history of  
gene-culture co-evolution and we wanna understand 
what Paleolithic populations were doing, we  
might be able to see imprints of it in the genes.
So in, in my own work, for example, we’ve measured  
cousin marriage across different populations and 
shown it correlates with runs of homozygosity  
in the genes. Something like polygeny can be 
revealed by looking at the ratio, the variance in  
Y chromosomes to X chromosomes. Fire: we probably 
have some special genetic adaptations for dealing  
with the toxins in fire. So if you wanna know 
when humans got fire, and you see the gene that  
gives us immunity to toxins in fire, then we 
can infer that fire is older than that, right? 
Interesting. And, so obviously the input from 
different scientific fields in your work is  
obvious. But from a more philosophical 
perspective, people compare your work  
in the same tradition as Burke or Chesterton 
or something. Do you personally find that  
your philosophy has been informed by 
reading them, or is it just independently  
converging on some of the same themes?
Yeah, I mean, any convergence is completely  
independent, because I haven’t really spent much 
time at all. I mean, I’ve gone back. After people  
said, “Your work is kinda like Hayek,” I went 
back and read some Hayek. I did read The Fatal  
Conceit in graduate school, but aside from that, 
I didn’t read very much. And then same thing with  
Adam Smith. I mean, I’ve tackled The Wealth of 
Nations, and I eventually read The Theory of  
Moral Sentiments. But it was pretty far into 
the process. I had picked up on themes they  
developed before I knew they had developed them.
I want to suggest that maybe you should add a  
couple of AI people in your rotation.
Ok. 
Just because I think this perspective is 
incredibly informative, what I think is  
maybe the most important question of our period, 
of what does this transition towards a society  
of AIs look like? And, sorry to bring it back 
to AI, but one other consideration here that  
your work has really informed me on, is: I was 
sort of maybe hyping up how big a deal I expect  
societies of AIs to be, but something your work 
informs is the idea of a single superintelligence  
is not the place in which to expect these 
big impacts of John von Neumann times 10. 
But then again, there is a key advantage in the 
scope of social learning they can do as a society,  
but, like, the idea of a single superintelligence 
being super powerful is maybe less likely as a  
result of your work. And I, anyways, I don’t know 
what you think about that interpretation, but… 
Yeah, I think that’s right because the 
assumption, the sort of model that people  
seem to carry around in their heads is that 
humans have done all these things because of  
our individual brain power when really, it’s been 
the power of cultural evolution and a network of  
minds gnawing away at problems over long periods 
of time and gradually accumulating not just the  
obvious tools, but also the cognitive 
tools for, for addressing these things. 
I buy the idea that individual IQ isn’t the most 
relevant factor to understanding why discoveries  
are made. It’s not about having the right genius 
or something. But what’s the reason for thinking  
that the average IQ of a society isn’t super 
important in how much progress a society’s  
gonna make, not just the population size?
Right. So the first thing that we need to  
do though is to zoom back out and think about what 
we mean by IQ. And so Michael Muthu Krishnan and  
I have made the case that IQ is just a set 
of cognitive abilities that leads to success  
in 20th century contemporary institutions that 
have come to dominate the world. So it’s a set,  
it’s a culturally evolved system, and we talked 
before about the Flynn effect which illustrates  
that, and the fact that IQ is associated 
with all these positive outcomes now, but  
certainly wouldn’t be in pastoralist societies.
So that would mean that if you raise the average  
IQ of your society, it might lead them to have 
more abstract thoughts and do better science.  
And so that’s, that certainly fits. But the 
interesting thing for me is that the world of the  
future is gonna be quite different than the one 
now. So the set of cognitive abilities which is  
gonna be favored in the new AI world is not gonna 
be the same set that was favored in 1900 when they  
designed the IQ test. So for example, in the IQ 
test they ask you to remember digits backwards.  
I’m not sure how useful remembering lists of 
digits backwards [is]. It was in a previous world,  
where we had to write everything down and 
remember a lot of stuff. But in some sense,  
we’re interfacing with our technology and we’ve 
got to figure out what are the set of cognitive  
abilities which is gonna make people best able 
to solve problems? And like we talked about,  
it’s even the case that the most creative 
people aren’t the highest IQ people. 
I guess one of the things I’m trying 
to say is that the minds that might  
lead us into the new world might not be the 
ones that have the highest IQ because once  
you’re sort of augmented with AI and all 
these kind of technological aids we have,  
the specialized thing that leads someone to 
do something creative- probably not gonna be  
the same abilities that did it in 1910.
Yeah. I guess my real opinion is that,  
if in the world where that’s true- and I think 
that’s probably gonna be true- then it really  
doesn’t matter at all because AIs will be 
doing everything. But in the world where,  
let’s say AI plateaus or something, then I would 
expect roughly the same kinds of skills that have  
mattered for the last couple of centuries to keep 
mattering for a modern, technological society,  
which is analytical thinking and the ability to 
understand science and technology and so forth. 
But maybe the AI world you’re imagining 
is different than the one I’m imagining,  
but I still think that people are gonna 
figure out what problems we need to solve,  
unless we’re just gonna tell the AIs to figure 
out what the problems are and then solve them. 
They might not be that good at 
that. I don’t know. We’ll see. 
You shared with me this draft 
of work about collective brains,  
where you show that ants have developed many of 
the technologies that humans have, like farming,  
and livestock, and division of labor and so 
forth. And so maybe there’s some amount of  
blind selection, and it doesn’t matter if it’s 
natural selection, if it’s cultural selection,  
it’s the size of the group which can go through 
this learning process that matters, and how many  
people are available to experience the learnings 
or get the selection process acted upon them. 
But I guess the big difference in where maybe 
individual IQ comes back into the picture here is,  
I don’t expect there to be any amount of natural 
selection which will allow ants to land on the  
moon or make a computer chip or do, you know, 
make a nuclear fusion plant or something. And  
so is the kind of broad generalization we 
see with humans, and we might see to an  
even greater extent with AI, a product of you’re 
really bottlenecked by the IQ of the individual?  
There’s no amount of collective learning that 
can get you to the moon if you’re an ant? 
Right. Well, one thing to keep in 
mind is that most human societies  
over most of human evolutionary history 
didn’t get to the moon. So this is one  
particular group of humans. And 
one of the things we talked about  
earlier in this conversation was the 
cultural evolution of epistemology. 
So it was the improvement in our what constitutes 
evidence, what constitutes a good argument that  
allows us to get to science and accumulate this 
kind of knowledge to do these kinds of things.  
So I see that as part of a continuous trajectory. 
But it’s just that we have new cognitive tools. 
Right. I guess, but… so there’s a really 
interesting point that even the epistemic  
tools which let us get to the moon are themselves 
a product of cultural evolution. But again,  
that seems bottlenecked by the fact that if 
you’re just dealing with chimpanzees or something,  
there’s no amount of cultural evolution that 
will result in the scientific method, that- 
Right. It needs some gene culture co-evolution.
Right, right. So you mentioned in the Secret  
the tool use started something like 
two million years ago, and fire,  
we started domesticating fire closer to 
800,000 to a million years ago. Intuitively,  
it doesn’t seem like tool use is that that much 
simpler than fire, but is that a misunderstanding?  
Why was fire so much [more] recent?
Well, so what we know from other  
species is that lots of animals use tools, 
and particularly chimpanzees use tools. So  
we can assume tools in the common ancestor. 
Now, what we see in the paleoanthropological  
record is the increasing use of stone tools.
And these are pretty simple stone tools. You  
can see a cutting edge there, but not very much 
fancier than that. And then fire is… a lot of  
animals are afraid of fire, and they have to run 
from wildfires and stuff like that. So whatever  
your story about humans is, you have to overcome 
the fear of the fire in order to tame it. Probably  
humans first found wild fire and somebody 
approached the fire instead of running away,  
which is the usual thing to do. And then got some 
of it and then put it to use, I guess. So I think  
it’s the innate fear that animals have of fire, 
which is we don’t hang around when things go off. 
Interesting. Okay, final question, 
what’s the next thing you’re working on? 
Well, the big thing is this book on 
collective brains, so I’m gradually  
working through that. One of the ideas that I 
really am excited about in this book is that  
we evolved to think in collectives. There’s 
this assumption that psychologists have had  
to understand human decision-making and how 
our minds solve problems is that we should  
put people by themselves in experiments and 
see how they do. But real human societies,  
hunter-gatherers, they actually work in groups. 
And when we want to solve a problem, the first  
thing we want to do is check with our friends 
or ask other expert members of the community. 
So it’s the idea that we think collectively and 
solve problems collectively in a kind of naturally  
distributed brain. And Hugo Mercier and Dan 
Sperber, for example, have argued and shown with  
various lines of evidence that many of the sort of 
irrational biases we have, mitigate or disappear  
entirely when we solve problems as groups. So 
it’s almost like we evolved to have that positive  
interaction and correct each other’s errors.
Right. That’s quite interesting that you care  
more about the portfolio of intelligences 
than any one person being calibrated. 
Right.
Excellent. This is super fun.  
Thanks so much for coming on the podcast.
All right. Great to be with you.
