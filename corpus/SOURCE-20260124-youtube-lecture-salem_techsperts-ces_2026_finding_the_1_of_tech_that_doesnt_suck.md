## Description (no transcript available)

CES wasn't all just AI nonsense and overpriced tech that no one can afford, there were some impressive builds and inspiring stories! 
Shout out to everyone I met at CES, and to the employees that spent their time giving me a tour and run down of their products. 

Pebble - Making wearable tech that is open-source and (mostly) repairable
xLean - Best robo vac to date
BiWin - RAM and SSD manufacturer that have been making the best storage for other companies for years, and are finally entering the CONSUMER market directly!
Be quiet! - The quietest tech that's ever lived.
MSI - Many Small Improvements, let's hope this proves to be true!
ASUS - Still the best products with some of the worst customer support.
GIGABYTE - Insanely powerful laptops
Thermaltake - Amazing cases and fans. Such a cool booth to visit.
Meta PC's - Incredibly talented custom PC building company
