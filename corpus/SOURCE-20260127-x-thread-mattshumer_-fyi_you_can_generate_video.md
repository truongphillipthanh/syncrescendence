# AI Video Generation with Nano Banana - Thread Archive

## Post 1

**FYI you can generate video with Nano Banana!**

It's super primitive, but with enough effort, it should work really well!

Here's how:

**First, tell Claude what you want to generate.**

Then say: *"We're going to go frame-by-frame. Generate a prompt for the first frame. I will then pass you the image that is generated as a result, and you will write the next prompt for the next frame."*

For each prompt, pass it to **Nano Banana Pro**. When the image is generated, give it to Claude, and ask for the next prompt.

Repeat until you have the frames you need, then have Claude combine them.

**It's basically stop motion but with AI!**
