## Claim (11)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260203-023-0001
**Lines**: 12-14
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.90, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.90

> For most of software history, execution was scarce, with writing code being slow, expensive, and constrained by human throughput, making the existence of software itself the primary challenge.

**Lines**: 16-20
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.80

> AI coding agents invert the traditional software development world by enabling code to be produced quickly, cheaply, and in enormous volume, shifting the limiting factor from execution to coordination and judgment, especially for frontier teams.

**Lines**: 22-29
**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> If ten people were to build DocuSign today, their time would be spent debating edge cases, compliance, trust guarantees, auditability, error semantics, UX, and the legal meaning of "signing" rather than typing code, indicating that the work has shifted to intent.

**Lines**: 32-37
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.60

> As software becomes abundant, the ability to clearly articulate intent becomes scarce, and this intent often involves deeply technical aspects like accumulated context, system knowledge, and judgment about tradeoffs.

**Lines**: 39-44
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The shift towards software abundance is counterintuitive because it redefines engineering excellence; historically, the most respected engineers were closest to the code, but now the bottleneck and leverage points are moving away from direct code interaction.

**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Experienced engineers infer context when given instructions like "make this faster," considering factors such as latency, throughput, acceptable tradeoffs, and the validity of the premise itself, which AI coding agents lack.

**Lines**: 53-55
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> AI coding agents either produce plausible but wrong results due to under-specification or require more time for instruction writing than for direct coding due to over-specification.

**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Software abundance makes the gap between intent and execution visible, as executing the wrong intent becomes cheap, leading to quick manifestation of misalignment.

**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The author's personal experience of spending as much time steering or correcting an AI agent as writing code directly revealed tacit understandings of the system that had never been articulated, shifting the work from typing to clarifying judgment.

**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> A human engineer rejects unacceptable code not because it is incorrect, but because it might cross boundaries, optimize the wrong dimension, introduce fragile abstractions, mishandle edge cases, or quietly remove future options, making them unwilling to own it.

**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The gap between correctness and acceptability highlights the importance of engineering intent, which often comes down to "taste" – knowing when something is technically right but structurally wrong for the system being built.

**Lines**: 70-75
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Unacceptable code, as distinct from broken code, runs and passes tests but violates the system's implicit contract by breaking invisible invariants (e.g., assumptions about idempotency, ordering, failure semantics, data integrity, or legacy coupling) that were learned through experience.
