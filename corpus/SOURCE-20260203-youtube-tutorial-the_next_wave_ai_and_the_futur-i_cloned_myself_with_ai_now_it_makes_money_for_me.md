Episode 95: What if your next phone call, business consult, or even pep talk came from an AI version of your favorite expert—or even yourself? Matt Wolfe (https://x.com/mreflow) and Maria Gharib (https://uk.linkedin.com/in/maria-gharib-091779b9) are joined by Joe Fier (https://x.com/joefier), co-founder of The Clone Shop, advisor to Delphi, host of the Hustle and Flowchart podcast, and an early pioneer in digital clone technology.
In this episode, the hosts dig in with Joe Fier about the real-world applications of “digital minds”—AI clones trained to speak, think, and answer just like you or your favorite personalities. They break down how tools like Delphi can save countless hours by fielding repetitive questions, monetizing expertise, handling lead gen, and even boosting creator mental health by setting smart boundaries.
