## Description (no transcript available)

What is boredom really and why does it feel so unbearable?

Professor Hannah Fry and Michael Stevens explore the science of boredom, revealing it not as laziness or a lack of stimulation, but as a signal from the brain when prediction and learning grind to a halt. When nothing changes and everything is expected, the mind begins to push back.
From dopamine experiments and waiting rooms to sensory deprivation and solitary confinement, they examine how boredom emerges from lost uncertainty and why the brain would rather create discomfort, hallucinations, or anxiety than stop predicting altogether.

This episode unpacks the psychology and neuroscience of boredom, showing how surprise drives pleasure, how boredom reshapes behaviour, and why this uneasy emotion may be essential to curiosity, creativity, and human progress.
