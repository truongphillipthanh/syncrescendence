## Classification Patterns (Wisdom)

### What Works
- **Semantic topic as sole classifier.** A file about consciousness goes in philosophy-esoterica whether it's .jsonl, .md, .py, or .log. This principle resolved every ambiguity once enforced.
- **Agent-independent convergence.** When Oracle, Cartographer, and Adjudicator independently agree a file is misplaced, it is misplaced. Triangulation eliminates individual bias.
- **Content-reading over filename-matching.** Files with numeric IDs (00001.jsonl) carry no semantic signal in their names. Only reading content determines placement.

### Anti-Patterns (SEARED)
- **Type-based routing** — the single most common error. Routing all .jsonl to ai-memory-retrieval, all .py to infrastructure, all .log to multi-agent-systems. CONSTITUTIONALLY FORBIDDEN. The content determines the folder, never the extension.
- **Source-based routing** — clustering by content creator or platform instead of topic. Alex Hormozi content about business goes in product-business; his content about health goes in health-psychology. Creator is not a category.
- **Keyword inflation** — "claw" or "molt" in a filename doesn't mean openclaw. "Agent" doesn't mean multi-agent-systems. Read the content.
- **News-roundup scatter** — AI news digests covering multiple topics were scattered across folders based on which topic was mentioned first. These belong in ai-capability-futures (their primary semantic weight is AI trajectory).
- **Operational-vs-about conflation** — a config file FOR a multi-agent system is ABOUT multi-agent systems. A task file about memory architecture is ABOUT ai-memory-retrieval. The "about" test always wins.

### Boundary Rulings (Sovereign-Ratified)
- **philosophy-esoterica vs meaning-civilization**: SEPARATE. Natural joint confirmed — consciousness/mysticism IS different from meaning/civilization.
- **claude-code vs vibe-coding**: SEPARATE. Claude Code = the specific tool/platform. Vibe coding = the general practice regardless of tool.
- **ai-memory-retrieval vs productivity-pkm**: SEPARATE. Different audiences, different problems. AI memory = technical architecture. PKM = human knowledge workflows.
- **multi-agent-systems**: Coherent despite size. Internal Syncrescendence operational files belong here when they ARE about multi-agent coordination.

## Near-Duplicate Registry

122 adjudicated candidates (114 delete_subset, 7 delete_truncated, 1 delete_merge). Status: pending CRUSH execution. Policy: MERGE (preserve unique content into keeper), not delete.

Full registry preserved in git history (commit `1a5eba0c` and prior). Execute near-dupe merges as next CRUSH phase.

---

## JSONL Redundancy

~1,002 Flat JSONL files are byte-for-byte identical to the `payload` field of paired Graphiti JSONL files. Distributed across all folders. Removal requires content-aware sweep (identify the Flat variant, keep the Graphiti variant). Next CRUSH phase after near-dupe merges.

## Constitutional Constraints

1. **CLUSTERING BY TYPE IS FORBIDDEN.** Classification is by semantic topic of contents, always and only.
2. **No "other" / "general" / "uncategorized" buckets.** Every file earns its folder by topic.
3. **Nothing gets deleted** without Sovereign approval. Merge policy for near-dupes.
4. **philosophy-esoterica and meaning-civilization remain SEPARATE** (Sovereign ruling CC56).

## Teleology (Sovereign Directive CC56 — SEARED)

The corpus is becoming a textbook — a compendium to build the Syncrescendence.

We cluster progressively. Subcategories will form within folders. Metacategories will form across folders. We semantically tighten for maximal coherence. Every misclassification is a flaw in the canon. Every reclassification illuminates.

The end state is a navigable knowledge architecture where any reader can find any piece of the Syncrescendence vision by semantic topic, drill into subcategories for depth, and zoom out to metacategories for breadth.
