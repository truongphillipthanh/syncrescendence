When A.I. first came on to the scene over 10 years ago (hello, Siri). I was expecting it to basically act as my digital assistant, taking over many of the boring tasks in my digital life.

Unfortunately, that never really manifested, and instead we've been left A.I. generating slop and taking over the act of writing code.

Fortunately, things are looking up, and it seems we finally have something that fulfills my original expectation:

Clawdbot

And it's glorious.
