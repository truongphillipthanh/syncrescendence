## Description (no transcript available)

Science & Cocktails is proud to announce an episode with biochemist Nick Lane, Professor of Evolutionary Biochemistry and Director of the Centre for Life’s Origins and Evolution (CLOE) at University College London and author of the book "The Deep Chemistry of Life and Death", who will tell you about what are the building blocks of life. 
How did life on Earth begin? Why did animals evolve so quickly in the ‘Cambrian explosion’? Why is the same biochemical cycle used to create and destroy? Can bacteria feel pain? What brings our own lives to an end?
What brings the Earth to life and our own lives to an end? The answer is not 42, but something equally anodyne – the Krebs cycle. Most people learn about the Krebs cycle in school as a simple set of reactions used to generate energy in cells. But we are not usually taught that it can also run backwards to turn simple gases into living matter. Or that this could be how life on Earth began. Or that this tension between creation and destruction – between burning organic molecules in respiration and forming them anew from gases – underpins ageing and diseases such as cancer. We are definitely not told that this tension might give rise to consciousness itself. Nick Lane will tell you about these things over a cocktail or two.

Professor of Evolutionary Biochemistry and Director of the Centre for Life’s Origins and Evolution (CLOE) at University College London. His research is on how energy flow has shaped evolution from the origin of life to the evolution of complex eukaryotic cells and the emergence of traits such as sex, ageing and consciousness. Nick has published more than 130 papers in leading journals including Nature, Cell and Science, and written five award-winning books which have been translated into 30 languages. Bill Gates called Nick Lane's book The Vital Question “an amazing inquiry into the origins of life”.
