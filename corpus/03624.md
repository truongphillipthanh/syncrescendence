**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The speed of task completion with Claude Code is not hype; it represents a fundamentally different and faster way of working, enabling tasks that would take hours to be completed in seconds.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-008-0009
**Lines**: 93-93
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Designers do not need to be highly technical or developers to effectively use Claude Code, as it is designed to meet users at their current skill level.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260206-008-0006
**Lines**: 80-82
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The core value of Claude Code for designers is not in writing code from scratch, but in acting as an assistant that understands an entire project and can implement changes across many files rapidly.

## Praxis Hook (4)
