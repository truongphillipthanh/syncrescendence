## Description (no transcript available)

Lovable grew to 8 million users and crossed $100M ARR while reporting 100% net dollar retention and pursuing a reported $5B funding round. Meta released Lingual, an open-source ASR that recognizes 1,600+ languages and can scale via zero-shot in-context learning to thousands more. Warnings about mass job displacement, CoreWeave's mixed earnings and product delays, and an AI-driven market rebound underscore trade-offs between rapid AI progress and societal and infrastructure risks.
