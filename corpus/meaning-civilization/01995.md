**Lines**: 10-11
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.30, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Our current economic system collapses value into singular metrics like price, which makes systems brittle and less capable of adaptation and optionality.

## Praxis Hook (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251218-803-0004
**Lines**: 13-14
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.40

> To ensure long-term survival, we must transition to an 'optioneering' architecture by redesigning institutions and economic grammar to increase the surface area of future freedom rather than foreclosing on it.

**Lines**: 15-16
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.40

> We can build a civilization capable of coherence in motion by shifting away from 'closed projects' with finite ends to 'open gardens' where success is measured by the system's ability to evolve and surprise, valuing adaptation over control.
