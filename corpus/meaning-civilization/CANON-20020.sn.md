# Κ-20020: Meta-Systems (SN)

PASS Canon20020Metasystems:
    sutra: "Four meta-systems (70-73) provide unified infrastructure for 87 Cognitive Palace components"
    gloss:
        @Meta-Systems provides communication, pattern storage, user interface, and adaptive learning infrastructure. Enables 87 Cognitive Palace components to function as unified intelligence.
end

PASS CognitivePalaceSatelliteInfrastructure:
    sutra: "Cognitive Palace Satellite infrastructure enables coherence across system components"
    gloss:
        @Cognitive Palace operates through four meta-systems: @Universal Resonance Field (STR), @Pattern Library System (TOOL), @Seven Pulses Dashboard (TOOL), @Adaptive Interface System (TOOL). Satellite status enables distributed coherence.
end

PASS Purpose:
    sutra: "Meta-systems enable natural communication and unified operation across all components"
    gloss:
        Infrastructure handles communication, pattern storage, user interface management, and adaptive learning. Four systems integrate 87 components as coherent whole. Information flows organically; insights emerge without forced protocols.
end

PASS 70UniversalResonanceField:
    sutra: "Universal Resonance Field enables harmonious natural communication between all system components"
    gloss:
        @Universal Resonance Field (@URF) operates on three principles: (1) information flows organically, insights emerge from system wisdom, integration via harmony not force; (2) system responds to actual needs adaptively; (3) protocols evolve based on effectiveness. Communication patterns vary by resonance level: Strong resonance produces clear direction, weak produces gentle suggestions, none maintains silence. Operates across three layers: Reality Foundation (core values guide all), Experiential Interface (life experience validates), Developmental Support (infrastructure enables growth). Success indicators: insights emerge effortlessly, coherence feels natural, wisdom appears as own thought, integration automatic.
end

PASS CoreFunction:
    sutra: "Core function enables natural information flow and harmonious component integration"
    gloss:
        @URF enables organic communication without predetermined protocols. Information resonates across system layers. Integration emerges from harmony rather than forced architecture.
end

NORM ResonancePrinciples:
    sutra: "Resonance principles govern communication: natural flow, adaptive responsiveness, organic insight emergence"
    gloss:
        REQUIRED: Information flows naturally without forcing integration (rule: harmony over force). REQUIRED: System responds to actual context-dependent needs, not predetermined patterns (rule: adaptive > rigid). REQUIRED: Insights emerge from collective wisdom (rule: emergence > imposition). Enforcement: measure coherence through effortlessness metric; insights without effort indicate proper resonance.
end

PASS CommunicationPatterns:
    sutra: "Resonance strength determines communication directness: strong signals clear action, weak suggests options, none awaits timing"
    gloss:
        Three resonance levels structure communication: Strong (clear direction, immediate action), Weak (gentle suggestions, multiple options), None (silence honored, natural timing). Communication varies by context and emerges from genuine resonance.
end

PASS LayerCommunication:
    sutra: "Three operational layers: Reality Foundation, Experiential Interface, Developmental Support"
    gloss:
