# Κ-00015: Macroscopic Narratives (SN)

PASS Canon00015MacroscopicNarratives:
    sutra: "Active interpretive filters for civilizational signal qualification across phase transitions"
    gloss:
        @Macroscopic Narratives: taxonomy of narrative lenses filtering external content for @signal qualification against civilizational dynamics. Not passive taxonomy but active interpretive infrastructure identifying lens alignment, phase transition relevance, and cross-lens synthesis. Required evaluation across: (1) signal qualification—illuminates civilizational dynamics; (2) lens alignment—which narratives advanced/challenged; (3) phase transition relevance—positioning during reflexive aperture; (4) cross-lens synthesis—patterns across frameworks.
end

PASS InterpretiveLensesForCivilizational:
    sutra: "Fifteen narrative lens families structuring phase transition interpretation"
    gloss:
        Framework comprises 15 lens families: Planetary/Geological (Anthropocene, Great Acceleration, Holocene transition), Systems/Complexity (Metacrisis, Polycrisis, Adaptive Cycle, Great Filter), Technological/Industrial (Post-industrial, Information/AI/Atomic/Synthetic/Cybernetic ages, Compute Overhang), Economic/Financial (Great Decoupling, Debt Cycle end, Post-scarcity, Slowbalization, Great Transition), Geopolitical (Multipolarity), Information/Epistemic (Epistemic Crisis, Infodemics, Attention Economy), Demographic/Spatial (Global transition, Urban century), Cultural/Psychological (Interregnum, Metamodernism, Exhaustion, Meaning Crisis, Re-embodiment, Re-enchantment), Evolutionary/Consciousness (Axial 2.0, Noosphere, Posthuman, Singularity, Post-singularity), Institutional/Governance (Great Hollowing/Vetocracy, Postnormal), Cyclic/Periodization (Kondratieff Wave 5, Peak Modernity, 2020-2050 transformation), Paradoxes (Stagnation vs Intelligence Explosion, Biosecurity Dilemma), Energy/Ecology/Thermodynamics (Net-zero transition, Entropic Threshold), Domain-specific (Space economy, Network society, Cosmotechnics, Chronic disease pandemic), Emergent Priorities (Resilience, Integration).
end

PASS CelestialNavigation:
    sutra: "Positioning within Syncrescendent cosmos hierarchy"
    gloss:
        Orbital Class: 🌌 Cosmos. Parent: CANON-00010 (Syncrescendent Operations). Siblings: CANON-00005 (Syncrescendence), CANON-00007 (Evaluation), CANON-00012 (Modal Sequence), plus foundational corpus. Operational role: active filter for all source processing and CANON integration.
end

PASS Purpose:
    sutra: "Signal qualification through narrative lens application"
    gloss:
        @Macroscopic Narratives functions as interpretive infrastructure for source triage: (1) @signal qualification—determine whether content illuminates civilizational phase transition dynamics; (2) @lens alignment—identify which narrative(s) content advances, challenges, or synthesizes; (3) phase transition relevance—assess positioning utility at reflexive aperture; (4) @cross-lens synthesis—pattern detection across multiple frameworks simultaneously.
end

TERM OverarchingIntegrativeConcepts:
    sutra: "Three core integrative concepts structuring civilizational analysis"
    gloss:
        @Reflexive Epoch: systems becoming conscious of and recursive upon themselves across all scales simultaneously. Highest common invariant: rising reflexivity. @Integrative Interregnum: interval between worlds where boundaries soften, all systems self-model, coherence requires conscious composition. Reframes chaos as design material. Poised action between old framework exhaustion and new organizing principle emergence. @Civilizational Phase Transition: pivot point where rules enabling prior continuation now undermine continuation. Fundamental metamorphosis—capacity development must match transformation speed. Central question: can humans generate new capacities faster than crisis acceleration?
end

PASS TheReflexiveEpoch:
    sutra: "Systems achieving self-awareness and recursive self-modification across civilization"
    gloss:
        @Reflexive Epoch captures era where every major system becomes aware of own feedback and transforms through that awareness. Human world system undergoes simultaneous phase transition across all scales. Systems modeling themselves now act on own models, closing feedback loops amplifying both instability and potential. First humans navigating conditions institutions weren't designed for.
end

PASS TheIntegrativeInterregnum:
    sutra: "Interval between worlds characterized by boundary dissolution and conscious coherence composition"
    gloss:
        @Integrative Interregnum: period between exhaustion of old frameworks and emergence of new organizing principles. All historically externalized frontiers (nature, machine, psyche, cosmos) re-enter circle of self-modeling systems. Not merely chaotic but pregnant with integration opportunity. Material for conscious design rather than passive disruption. Requires composing coherence from available elements.
end

PASS TheCivilizationalPhaseTransition:
    sutra: "Convergent evidence of fundamental metamorphosis in civilizational operating rules"
    gloss:
        @Civilizational Phase Transition reflects multiple convergent observations: rules enabling current systems actively prevent their continuation. Metamorphosis not mere crisis but ontological shift. Central question embedded across all frameworks: can humans develop new capacities fast enough? Success requires matching capacity development to crisis acceleration timeline.
end

PASS IPlanetaryGeologicalPhases:
    sutra: "Geological era defined by humanity as dominant planetary force"
    gloss:
        @Anthropocene Epoch marks transition from passive inhabitant to dominant planetary force. Ends 10,000-year Holocene stability enabling agriculture and civilization. Humanity now inscribed in stratigraphy through carbon, plastics, extinction. Multiple formulations: as geological force with million-year implications; as inflection from unknowing change to conscious planetary management; as fundamental context for all other frameworks; as coupled human-Earth co-evolution. First humans navigating non-Holocene conditions.
end

PASS TheGreatAcceleration:
    sutra: "Post-1950 hockey-stick exponential surge in all human throughput metrics"
    gloss:
        @Great Acceleration: post-1950 exponential across population, energy, urbanization, carbon, computing, data. Time compression where decision horizons shrink faster than governance adapts. Inflection where slope becomes vertical. Amplified leverage era where minimal interventions yield outsized consequences. Defines era of extreme sensitivity to small initial conditions.
end

PASS PlanetaryPhaseShift:
    sutra: "Comprehensive simultaneous transformation of humanity-Earth co-evolving systems"
    gloss:
        @Planetary Phase Shift: systems theory describing comprehensive transformation where every foundational technology (energy, transport, food, communication, materials) undergoes simultaneous phase transition. Civilization progresses through adaptive cycle from breakdown (release) toward potential renewal. Represents transition from Nature as background to Nature as co-actor. Follows C.S. Holling ecological model: four stages—rapid growth, conservation, release, renewal.
end

PASS TheEndOfThe:
    sutra: "Exit from stable climatic conditions that enabled Holocene-era civilization"
    gloss:
        @End of Holocene: emphasizes exit from climate stability paradigm underlying all human institutions and continuity assumptions. Complete inversion: stability shifts from background to achievement requiring constant management. Navigating non-Holocene conditions unprecedented in institutional experience. Stability as maintained system property rather than given condition.
end

PASS IiSystemsComplexityPhases:
    sutra: "Interlocking system failures emerging from common generator functions"
    gloss:
        @Metacrisis: not one crisis but interlocking failure of ecological, financial, epistemic, institutional systems from same underlying generator functions. Multiple existential risks (AI, biotech, nuclear, ecological) as symptoms not separate challenges. Capacity to create consequences outpaces capacity to manage wisely. Cascading feedback where problem domains amplify one another demanding integration over specialization.
end

PASS ThePolycrisisPermacrisis:
    sutra: "Cascading interacting crises in tightly coupled global systems"
    gloss:
        @Polycrisis / Permacrisis: cascading, interacting crises where each amplifies others. Global systems so interconnected localized shocks ripple planetary-wide. Solutions in one domain create problems elsewhere revealing fragility from interdependence. Some frame as permanent crisis baseline—perpetual disruption becomes ground state not terminal crisis.
end

PASS AdaptiveCycleAndCivilizational:
    sutra: "Civilizational progression through growth-conservation-release-renewal adaptive cycle"
    gloss:
        @Adaptive Cycle: drawing C.S. Holling's ecology model—four stages: rapid growth/exploitation, stability/conservation, breakdown/release, reorganization/renewal. Current indicators—accelerating tech, ecological pressure, societal strain—suggest deep immersion in release/breakdown positioned at renewal verge. Front loop (growth/conservation) versus back loop (release/transformation). Transitioning from front to back loop of industrial civilization's lifecycle with emergence potential of radically new organizing forms.
end

PASS TheGreatFilterWindow:
    sutra: "Existential self-selection period determining technological civilization viability"
    gloss:
        @Great Filter Window: derived from Fermi Paradox—technological civilizations face filters determining thrival or self-destruction. Humanity occupies its filter window—decades where civilizations achieve coordination at scale or succumb to own power. Existential self-selection: intelligence survives its capabilities or doesn't. This generation occupies filter threshold.

        @Slowbalization / Fragmentation: arc of increasing global interconnection reverses. Trade and capital flows slow, re-regionalize. Economic activity organizing around regional blocs and security considerations over efficiency optimization. @Industrial Policy Revival: subsidies, controls, "friend-shoring" reshape supply chains. States reassert economic sovereignty. @Weaponized Interdependence: states exploit chokepoints in financial/technological networks for coercion. Globalization infrastructure becomes geopolitical terrain.
end

PASS TheGreatTransitionSociotechnicaleconomic:
    sutra: "Structural shift from extractive capitalism to regenerative post-growth civilization models"
    gloss:
        @Great Transition (Socio-Technical-Economic): movement from extractive industrial capitalism toward regenerative post-growth models. Replaces throughput maximization with resilience optimization. Economies learn metabolism rather than perpetual expansion. Structural transformation in human systems' resource-relationship and waste-handling.
end

PASS VGeopoliticalPhases:
    sutra: "Post-Cold War unipolarity ending, multipolar power realignment accelerating"
    gloss:
        @Multipolar Global System / Geopolitical Transition: end of post-Cold War "unipolar moment" and Pax Americana (~1991-2015). Persistent shift to multipolar configuration with rising Eastern influence. Unstable realignment into competing blocs characterized by renewed great-power competition, economic decoupling, technology/trade/information as strategic domains, disrupted alliances. Fourth Industrial Revolution becomes battleground through AI arms races, semiconductor sovereignty, standard-setting contests.

end

PASS TheAttentionEconomy:
    sutra: "Human attention as primary extracted commodity reshaped by algorithmic optimization"
    gloss:
        @Attention Economy: human attention as scarce primary commodity extracted, monetized, controlled. Economic/social model optimizing engagement capture through algorithms, product design, media platforms. Consequences: rewires cognition toward continuous partial attention and overload; fuels epistemic crisis by prioritizing engagement over truth; degrades cohesion through personalized bubbles; threatens cognitive sovereignty—right to control own focus. @As Cognitive Phase: central struggle becomes cognitive sovereignty. Resource conflict shifts from land/labor/capital to finite human consciousness.
end

PASS ViiDemographicSpatialPhases:
    sutra: "Unprecedented population decline and urban concentration defining spatial reorganization"
    gloss:
        @Global Demographic Transition / Demographic Crossroads: developed nations and China entering unprecedented population decline.
