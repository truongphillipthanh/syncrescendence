> Humans are not wired to win in today's modern markets because information is instantly priced in, making strategies dependent on reacting to news or opinions ineffective due to the millisecond half-life of new information.

**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Medallion's success stemmed from consistently exploiting small statistical advantages across thousands of instruments simultaneously through rapid trades in highly liquid assets, a feat impossible for human investors.

> Three key breakthroughs between 1952 and 1973 made autonomous investing inevitable: Harry Markowitz's mathematical portfolio construction (1952), William Sharpe's Capital Asset Pricing Model (1964), and Black and Scholes' options pricing equation (1973).

> The Black-Scholes method provided the necessary components for automated investing, allowing options to be priced and traded entirely by formulas and machines, replacing human estimation.

> Edward Thorp applied these mathematical investing ideas at Princeton/Newport Partners, and Jim Simons scaled this probabilistic framework at Renaissance's Medallion Fund, which is often considered the greatest fund of all time by annual returns.

**Lines**: 46-49
**Context**: consensus / limitation
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.80

> The Medallion Fund closed to outside investors in 1993 because additional capital would dilute returns by pushing trades into less liquid, lower-edge opportunities.

> Autonomous investing can be understood through five levels: Manual Investing (human judgment, relationships, timing), Algorithmic Investing (computer programs execute pre-defined rules), Automated Investing (systems manage complex tasks and workflow stacks), Autonomous Investing (ML models operate within objectives/constraints, update with new data), and Agentic AI Investing (fully autonomous systems plan, act, monitor, and self-correct).
