# Code Factory: How to setup your repo so your agent can auto write and review 100% of your code
(Description: A whimsical steampunk-themed illustration titled "CODE FACTORY" showing a complex mechanical system with gears, clockwork, robotic arms, and multiple interlocking chambers. A robot character on the left oversees the operation. Various labeled sections show: "MACHINE-READABLE CONTRACT" at top left, "REVIEW GATE" in the center, "EVIDENCE CLARITY" on the upper right, and "REPAIR PRIORITY" on the right. The bottom shows "PATH TO BRANCH" and "FINDINGS" with interconnected workflow loops. The aesthetic is Victorian-industrial with brass tones and detailed technical illustrations.)

## The goal
You want one loop:
1. The coding agent writes code
2. The repo enforces risk-aware checks before merge
3. A code review agent validates the PR
4. Evidence (tests + browser + review) is machine-verifiable
5. Findings turn into repeatable harness cases
The specific review agent can be [@greptile](https://x.com/@greptile), [@coderabbitai](https://x.com/@coderabbitai), CodeQL + policy logic, custom LLM review, or another service. The control-plane pattern stays the same.
I took inspiration from this helpful blog post by [@_lopopolo](https://x.com/@_lopopolo)

## The high-level flow
(Description: A flowchart diagram with white background showing the PR validation workflow. Blue box at top reads "Compute required checks from changed files" with downward arrow. Below is a yellow/orange box "Risk policy gate preflight" with two downward branches. Left branch goes to yellow box "Wait for code review agent on current head SHA" which connects to a diamond-shaped decision node "Review findings?" with "Yes" and "No" paths. The right branch from the preflight box curves around to the right. The diagram illustrates a sequential decision-tree process for code review automation.)

## 1) Keep one machine-readable contract
Your contract should define:
- risk tiers by path
- required checks by tier
- docs drift rules for control-plane changes
- evidence requirements for UI/critical flows
### JSON Configuration
```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "riskTierRules": {
    "high": [
      "app/api/legal-chat/**",
      "lib/tools/**",
      "db/schema.ts"
    ],
    "low": ["**"]
  },
  "mergePolicy": {
    "high": {
      "requiredChecks": [
        "risk-policy-gate",
        "harness-smoke",
        "Browser Evidence",
        "CI Pipeline"
      ]
    },
    "low": {
      "requiredChecks": [
        "risk-policy-gate",
        "CI Pipeline"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Why it matters: it removes ambiguity and prevents silent drift between scripts, workflow files, and policy docs.

## 2) Gate preflight before expensive CI
A reliable pattern is:
- run `risk-policy-gate` first
- verify deterministic policy + review-agent state
- only then start `test/build/security` fanout jobs
This avoids wasting CI minutes on PR heads that are already blocked by policy or unresolved review findings.
### TypeScript Example
```typescript
const requiredChecks = computeRequiredChecks(changedFiles, riskTier);
await assertDocsDriftRules(changedFiles);
await assertRequiredChecksSuccessful(requiredChecks);
if (needsCodeReviewAgent(changedFiles, riskTier)) {
  await waitForCodeReviewCompletion({
    headSha,
    timeoutMinutes: 20
  });
  await assertNoActionableFindingsForHead(headSha);
}
```
---
## 3) Enforce current-head SHA discipline
This was the biggest practical lesson from real PR loops.
Treat review state as valid only when it matches the current PR head commit:
- wait for the review check run on `headSha`
- ignore stale summary comments tied to older SHAs
- fail if the latest review run is non-success or times out
- require reruns after each synchronize/push
- clear stale gate failures by rerunning policy gate on the same head
If you skip this, you can merge a PR using stale "clean" evidence.
---
## 4) Use a single rerun-comment writer with SHA dedupe
When multiple workflows can request reruns, duplicate bot comments and race conditions appear.
Use exactly one workflow as canonical rerun requester and dedupe by marker + `sha:<head>`.
### TypeScript Example
```typescript
const marker = '<!-- review-agent-auto-rerun -->';
const trigger = `sha:${headSha}`;
const alreadyRequested = comments.some(
  (c) => c.body.includes(marker) && c.body.includes(trigger)
);
if (!alreadyRequested) {
  postComment(`${marker}\\n@review-agent please re-review\\n${trigger}`);
}
```
---
## 5) Add an automated remediation loop (optional, high leverage)
If review findings are actionable, trigger a coding agent to:
- read review context
- patch code
- run focused local validation
- push fix commit to the same PR branch
Then let PR synchronize trigger the normal rerun path. Keep this deterministic:
- pin model + effort for reproducibility
- skip stale comments not matching current head
- never bypass policy gates
---
## 6) Auto-resolve bot-only threads only after clean rerun
A useful quality-of-life step:
- after a clean current-head rerun
- auto-resolve unresolved threads where all comments are from the review bot
- never auto-resolve human-participated threads
Then rerun policy gate so required-conversation-resolution reflects the new state.
---
## 7) Keep browser evidence as first-class proof
For UI or user-flow changes, require evidence manifests and assertions in CI (not just screenshots in PR text):
- required flows exist
- expected entrypoint was used
- expected account identity is present for logged-in flows
- artifacts are fresh and valid
### Bash Commands
```bash
npm run harness:ui:capture-browser-evidence
npm run harness:ui:verify-browser-evidence
```
---
## 8) Preserve incident memory with a harness-gap loop
```
production regression -> harness gap issue -> case added -> SLA tracked
```
This keeps fixes from becoming one-off patches and grows long-term coverage.
---
## 9) What we learned running this in PRs
The most important lessons were:
1. Deterministic ordering matters: preflight gate must complete before CI fanout.
2. Current-head SHA matching is non-negotiable.
3. Review rerun requests need one canonical writer.
4. Review summary parsing should treat vulnerability language and weak-confidence summaries as actionable.
5. Auto-resolving bot-only threads reduces friction, but only after clean current-head evidence.
6. A remediation agent can shorten loop time significantly if guardrails stay strict.
---
## 10) General pattern vs. one implementation
### General pattern terms:
- `code review agent`
- `remediation agent`
- `risk policy gate`
### One concrete implementation (ours):
- code review agent: Greptile
- remediation agent: Codex Action
- canonical rerun workflow: `greptile-rerun.yml`
- stale-thread cleanup workflow: `greptile-auto-resolve-threads.yml`
- preflight policy workflow: `risk-policy-gate.yml`
If you use a different reviewer, keep the same control-plane semantics and swap integration points.
---
## Useful command set
```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build:ci
npm run harness:legal-chat:smoke
npm run harness:ui:pre-pr
npm run harness:risk-tier
npm run harness:weekly-metrics
```
---
## Final pattern to copy
1. Put risk + merge policy into one contract.
2. Enforce preflight gate before expensive CI.
3. Require clean code-review-agent state for current head SHA.
4. If findings exist, remediate in-branch and rerun deterministically.
5. Auto-resolve only bot-only stale threads after clean rerun.
6. Require browser evidence for UI/flow changes.
7. Convert incidents into harness cases and track loop SLOs.
That gives you a repo where agents can implement, validate, and be reviewed with deterministic, auditable standards.
