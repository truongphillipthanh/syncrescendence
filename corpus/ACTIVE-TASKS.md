# ACTIVE-TASKS.md
## Persistent Queue (crash-proof)

**P0 (Sovereign-blocked)**
- [ ] INT-2208: Grok Live Ledger sensing pass — Sovereign must deliver PROMPT-GROK-LIVE_LEDGER_SENSING.md to Oracle
- [ ] Mac mini: check for iCloud Desktop sync, repeat migration if needed

**P1 (Active)**
- [ ] INT-2209: Populate 12 DYN-LEDGER files from Grok sensing output
- [ ] INT-2210: Mine sources/research-notebooks/ for operational wisdom → SIGMA
- [ ] INT-2211: Chat↔CLI bridge synapticalization (per ARCH-LIVE_LEDGER.md bridge strategy)
- [ ] Community survey B1/B2/B3

**P2 (Pending)**
- [ ] Staleness detection script for ledger entries
- [ ] SURFACE-LIVE_LEDGER.md dashboard for Sovereign quick review
- [ ] Convergence coverage push from 12% → 25%+
- [ ] launchd plists updated on Mac mini for new ~/syncrescendence path
- [ ] State relocations (REF files → engine, ARCH files compaction)

**Blocked**
- [ ] Automated Grok→repo pipeline (requires platform API or relay)
- [ ] Gemini Drive live-sync for sensing (requires Google Drive re-config post-uninstall)
