4 hours of set up + SLACK + [@openclaw](https://x.com/openclaw) gets me :
- An actual useful daily report
- Preps research before every sales call
- Chases overdue projects for me
- Checks in with my team daily
- Drafts client messages in my voice
- Flags urgent emails instantly
- Tracks revenue and margins live
- Turns scripts into editor-ready briefs
- Builds tools while I sleep
- Follows up so nothing gets missed
- Flags unanswered client messages
- Generates proposals that close deals
- Remembers every client detail
- Runs 9 automations daily in the background
- Holds my team accountable 24/7
result? solved my supply side constraint and doubled MRR in 10 days.
