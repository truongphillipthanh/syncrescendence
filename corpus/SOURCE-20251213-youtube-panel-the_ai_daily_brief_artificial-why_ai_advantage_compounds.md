## Description (no transcript available)

AI advantage compounds as organizations integrate GenAI into workflows and scale beyond isolated experiments.

Reinvestment into AI capabilities and a shift from time-saving tasks to decision-making, revenue generation, and autonomous agents creates a self-reinforcing flywheel with non-linear ROI.
