## Description (no transcript available)

Just as linear perspective restructured how people recognized reality, generative AI is generating a new visual and political language. 

During the talk, Crawford gave us a tour through her detailed artwork Calculating Empires. Through examples ranging from Liebig’s critique of agriculture “robbing” soil nutrients to Faraday’s latex-based electrical insulation that devastated rubber forests, Crawford showed how technologies have long created “metabolic rifts”: systems that extract more than they regenerate.
AI, she suggested, is the newest metabolic rift. Its ingestion cycle—massive-scale data collection prized for quantity over quality—acts like poor nutrition at planetary scale. 

In the closing Q&A, Kevin Kelly asked what responsible, non-extractive AI might look like. Crawford imagined systems built on regenerative energy, consent-based data, and the ability to analyze their own biases and disparities. These futures aren’t impossible, just contested. Our task, Crawford urged, is to create new maps for an AI-shaped era and chart paths that protect the public interest and autonomy.

This talk was presented November 12, 02025 at the Cowell Theater in San Francisco.

Launched by Stewart Brand in 02003, Long Now Talks has invited more than 400 leading thinkers to share their civilization-scale ideas with a live audience and millions around the globe tuning in to our podcast and videos. Long Now Talks are brought to you by The Long Now Foundation, which has spent the last 25 years igniting cultural imagination around long-term thinking.

By inspiring thought and conversation about how we've been shaped by the last 10,000 years and what might be in store for us over the next 10,000 years, Long Now Talks seek to expand our collective sense of the present moment. Long Now Talks cover futurism and speculative fiction; time, nature, and contemplative practices; the intersection of the humanities and sciences; the evolution of counterculture to cyberculture; cultural imagination, land art and public monuments; and of course, long-term thinking and being a good ancestor.

In our age of compounding crises, The Long Now Foundation is a counterweight. We are a force that imagines new possibilities, thinks critically, and takes action over the long term. We believe that when we all come together, bound by commitment and curiosity, audacious things become possible. Will you join us?  https://longnow.org/join
