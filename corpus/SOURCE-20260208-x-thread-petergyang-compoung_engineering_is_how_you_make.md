## Compound Engineering: Making Claude Code Smarter

"**Compoung engineering is how you make Claude Code smarter every time you use it.**"

Here's my new episode with **@kieranklaassen** where he demos his 4-step system to make Claude Code improve with every session:

✅ **Plan.** Sub-agents research your codebase and best practices before any code is written.

✅ **Work.** Claude asks clarifying questions, then builds the feature and writes tests.

✅ **Assess.** Review agents check security, architecture, and code quality.

✅ **Compound.** Learnings are captured so Claude never repeats mistakes.

Kieran is my favorite Claude Code power user and I promise you'll learn alot too.
