What's really happening with AI agents on the super exponential timeline? The common story is that AI progress is fast but predictable — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why METR's latest benchmark changes everything for 2026:
- Why Opus 4.5 completing five hours of work signals super exponential growth
- How doubling every four months means 40-hour tasks by year-end
- What happens when delegating week-long work becomes the baseline skill
- Where domain expertise matters more but must be leveraged completely differently
