The Japanese Economy and Yen Are Facing a Decline — Will They Ever Recover? 🇯🇵📉 

Japan’s economy is flashing warning signs that investors can’t ignore. Bond yields are hitting levels not seen since 1999. Government debt has exploded past $10 trillion. And the Japanese yen has collapsed to multi-decade lows against the US dollar. Japan once looked unstoppable in the 1980s. Today, it’s a case study in debt, demographics, and the limits of monetary policy. Understanding what went wrong could help you avoid the same mistakes.

Japan isn’t just a local story. It holds over $1 trillion in US Treasury bonds, meaning trouble in Japan could:
❌ Push US interest rates higher
❌ Impact stock valuations and mortgages
❌ Create ripple effects across global debt markets
❌ Present unique investment opportunities due to a weak yen

Japan’s struggles are also a warning sign for other aging economies like China, South Korea, and Europe.

In this video, I break down exactly why Japan is facing its biggest economic test in decades, what’s driving the yen crisis, and whether recovery is even possible — or if Japan is entering a long, managed decline.
