## Overview

Something crazy just happened today.

@AnthropicAI's new plugins for Claude Cowork just triggered a $285 billion crash from global software, legal, and data services companies.

Cowork is an agentic AI assistant designed to act as a virtual teammate by directly managing files, folders, and applications on your computer. It can basically handle and automate a lot of work that these firms sell.

The impact was huge:

- 7% crash in the financial services index
- Nasdaq down 2.4% at its worst

## Let's talk more about the impact

### Legal Tech & Data Services Sector

Companies in the legal tech & data services sector faced the steepest declines:

- **LegalZoom:** Plunged nearly 20%
- **Thomson Reuters (owner of Westlaw):** Dropped 16–18%, erasing $8.2 billion in market value in a single session
- **RELX (owner of LexisNexis):** Fell 14%, losing approximately $11 billion in value
- **Wolters Kluwer:** Declined by 13%, shedding $6 billion
- **London Stock Exchange Group:** Plunged 13% on Tuesday and another 6% on Wednesday

### Broad Software Stocks

Broad software stocks suffered significant losses too:

- **Salesforce, Adobe, Workday, and ServiceNow:** Shares for these enterprise giants fell between 6% and 8%
- **Goldman Sachs Software Basket:** Dropped 6%, marking its worst single day since April
- **ETF Impact:** The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF fell significantly, contributing to a 29% decline since the start of January

### Global IT and Outsourcing Firms

Global IT and outsourcing firms were heavily impacted, likely due to fears that AI automation would reduce demand for the human labor arbitrage models these companies rely on.

- **Accenture & Cognizant:** Dropped by as much as 10%
- **Infosys:** Fell between 6% and 7.1%
- **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS):** Declined by 6%
- **Wipro:** Slid nearly 5%
- **Japanese Firms:** NEC, Nomura Research Institute, and Fujitsu lost between 7% and 11%

## What are Cowork Plugins?

Cowork plugins are extensions for Anthropic's "Claude Cowork" agent that allow users to bundle specific skills, connectors, slash commands, and sub-agents to transform Claude into a specialized assistant for specific roles or teams.

(Description: Screenshot of a plugin interface dashboard showing a nested file-based plugin system. The interface displays multiple panel columns with categories including "Plugins," "Local Plugins," "Sales," "Commands," "Agents," "Connectors," "Marketing," "Employees at," and "Skills." Each section contains expandable menu items and file paths like "draft-outreach," "pipeline-review," "ai-account-notes," "call-follow-up," with descriptions visible on the right side showing instructions for each plugin's functionality.)

These plugins enable the agent to execute complex, multi-step tasks directly on a user's computer without repeated prompting. For example, a legal plugin can automate contract reviews and compliance checks.

Anthropic initially released 11 open-source plugins covering areas like productivity, enterprise search, sales, finance, legal, and biology research to demonstrate their capabilities.

1. **Productivity:** Manage tasks, calendars, daily workflows, and personal context
2. **Enterprise search:** Find information across your company's tools and docs
3. **Plugin Create/Customize:** Create and customize new plugins from scratch
4. **Sales:** Research prospects, prep deals, and follow your sales process
5. **Finance:** Analyze financials, build models, and track key metrics
6. **Data:** Query, visualize, and interpret datasets
7. **Legal:** Review documents, flag risks, and track compliance
8. **Marketing:** Draft content, plan campaigns, and manage launches
9. **Customer support:** Triage issues, draft responses, and surface solutions
10. **Product management:** Write specs, prioritize roadmaps, and track progress
11. **Biology research:** Search literature, analyze results, and plan experiments

Plugins are file-based, making them easy to build, edit, and share. They are currently saved locally to a user's machine, though organization-wide sharing features are planned.

## SaaSpocalypse

Following the market crash, a new term, "SaaSpocalypse," was coined by the investment firm Jefferies to describe investors aggressively selling off Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) stocks due to fears that AI was moving from assisting software to replacing it.

Investors fear a phenomenon called "seat compression." The belief is that if AI agents can do the work of human employees, companies will hire fewer people and therefore buy drastically fewer software licenses (seats), destroying the per-user pricing model that powers the SaaS industry.

The term captures the realization that AI model providers (like Anthropic) are no longer just infrastructure providers but are becoming direct competitors at the application layer, potentially rendering traditional software intermediaries obsolete.

This is not the first market crash that AI tools have caused this year.

Just a couple of days ago, Google's announcement of Project Genie caused a gaming market meltdown. Stocks of popular gaming platforms like Roblox, Nintendo, CD Projekt Red, and Unity went down after the fact that AI tools can now generate interactive worlds with just a text prompt.
