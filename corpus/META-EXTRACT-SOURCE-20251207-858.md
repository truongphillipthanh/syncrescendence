## Analogy (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251207-858-0002
**Lines**: 20-23
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Just as physics found its language in calculus and circuit design in Boolean logic, Pedro Domingos argues that Tensor Logic will serve as the missing fundamental language for AI.

## Claim (3)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251207-858-0003
**Lines**: 37-42
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Current AI paradigms are split between Deep Learning (good at learning from data, poor at logical reasoning) and Symbolic AI (good at logical reasoning, poor at learning from messy real-world data), and these two do not integrate well.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251207-858-0004
**Lines**: 44-49
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.90, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Tensor Logic unifies Deep Learning and Symbolic AI into a single language, allowing for learning and modification of logical rules, transparent and verifiable reasoning without hallucinations, and the mixing of fuzzy analogical thinking with deduction.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251207-858-0005
**Lines**: 55-57
**Context**: rebuttal / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.40, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Pedro Domingos claims that trillions of dollars have been wasted on brute-force compute in AI because companies are 'reinventing reasoning' instead of leveraging 40 years of existing AI research.

## Concept (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251207-858-0001
**Lines**: 16-18
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Tensor Logic is a new programming language proposed by Pedro Domingos, intended to be the fundamental language for artificial intelligence.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251207-858-0006
**Lines**: 96-97
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Predicate Invention is the process by which a system learns to identify 'objects' from raw data, similar to how humans perceive objects rather than just pixels.
