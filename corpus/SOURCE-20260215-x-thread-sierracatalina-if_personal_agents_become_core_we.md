synopsis: "Proposes Agent Aware Architecture (AAA) - a standard for agent-readable web infrastructure with machine-legible actions, sensitive field boundaries, and confirmation gates for destructive operations. Open-sourced a starter repo."
key_insights:
  - "Agent-readable infrastructure needs explicit machine-legible primary actions, not just human-readable UIs"
  - "Sensitive field boundaries and confirmation gates for destructive ops are essential agent-web handshake standards"
  - "Early-stage standardization effort that could define how agents interact with web services"

if personal agents become core, we need agent-readable infrastructure.
AAA [agent aware architecture] defines:
- machine-legible primary actions
- sensitive field boundaries
- confirmation gates for destructive ops
open sourced a starter:
https://github.com/sierracatalina/agent-aware-starter
this could standardize the agent/web handshake.
