## Description (no transcript available)

Even if ChatGPT never existed, the tech giant NVIDIA would still be winning. The end of Moore’s Law—says NVIDIA President, Founder, and CEO Jensen Huang—makes the shift to accelerated computing inevitable, regardless of any talk of an AI “bubble.” Sarah Guo and Elad Gil are joined by Jensen Huang for a wide-ranging discussion on the state of artificial intelligence as we begin 2026. Jensen reflects on the biggest surprises of 2025, including the rapid improvements in reasoning, as well as the profitability of inference tokens. He also talks about why AI will increase productivity without necessarily taking away jobs, and how physical AI and robotics can help to solve labor shortages. Finally, Jensen shares his 2026 outlook, including why he’s optimistic about US-China relations, why open source remains essential for keeping the US competitive, and which sectors are due for their “ChatGPT moment.”
