## Praxis Hook (4)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-011-0002
**Lines**: 16-18
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.70

> A simple setup for using Codex involves git worktrees, multiple shell windows, and one VSCode instance per worktree for browsing code changes, which is largely available out-of-the-box in the new Codex app.

**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> A key to improving Codex's performance is to have it continually document and improve its own workflows by asking it to take notes and commit helpers to a personal folder in a monorepo.

**Lines**: 32-37
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> To quickly implement one-off experiments in unfamiliar codebase sections, use Codex to perform extensive due diligence by exploring Slack channels, reading discussions, fetching experimental branches, and cherry-picking useful changes, then summarizing this into notes with links.
