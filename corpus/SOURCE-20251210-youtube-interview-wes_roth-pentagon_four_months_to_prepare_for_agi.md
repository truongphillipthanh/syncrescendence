## Description (no transcript available)

In today’s episode, we break down some massive shifts in the AI landscape. First, the Pentagon is reportedly being ordered to prepare for General Intelligence (GI) with a new directive buried in the $900B defense bill. We look at the requirements for a "futures steering committee" and protocols for human overrides on super-intelligent systems by 2026.

Then, we dive into the rumors surrounding a potential SpaceX IPO and the mind-bending concept of "Project Sun Catcher"—solar-powered AI data centers in sun-synchronous orbit using space lasers for data transmission. Is Elon Musk trying to speed-run us to a Type II civilization on the Kardashev scale?

Plus, we cover the fallout from the XAI Hackathon, the media spin on the "Halftime" app, and President Trump’s announcement of a "One Rule Book" for AI regulation. We discuss the heated debate between David Sacks’ push for federal preemption versus state-level control, and what this means for open source and innovation.

Let me know what you think: Should AI regulation be top-down from the Feds or distributed across the States?
