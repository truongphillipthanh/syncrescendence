## Description (no transcript available)

2024 was the year of Agents. 2025 was the year of RL. According to DeepMind, 2026 will be the year of Continual Learning.
In this video, we dive deep into the latest research from Google DeepMind ("Titans" and "HOPE" architectures) and OpenAI to understand how AI is finally solving its biggest problem: Catastrophic Forgetting. We explore how new "Neuroplasticity" architectures are allowing models to learn forever—without context windows.
