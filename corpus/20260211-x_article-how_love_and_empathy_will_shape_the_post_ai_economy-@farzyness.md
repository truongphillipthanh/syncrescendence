## The Crisis We're Not Talking About

Loneliness & poor mental health costs America about $460 billion a year. That's roughly the GDP of Vietnam—an entire country's economic output, wiped out by people feeling alone. More than the US spends on its military research and development. More than every venture capital deal in 2025 combined. The economy is screaming at us about what it values—and almost nobody in tech or finance is paying attention.

I've been covering the AI transition for fourteen years, since 2012, every day, obsessively—yes, I obviously have a problem. But in all that time, the conversation about AI's economic impact has been stuck on the same question: which jobs will the machines take?

## Wrong question.

The right question is: when machines handle survival, what does the human economy actually organize around? Because I think the answer is going to surprise people—it surprised me.

Love, empathy, meaning, connection, and self-actualization.

I know how that sounds—like some Silicon Valley wellness retreat nonsense.

## So let me show you the data, and then you can decide.

In 1943—right in the middle of World War II—a psychologist named Abraham Maslow published a paper called "A Theory of Human Motivation." You've probably seen it summarized as a pyramid. Physiological needs at the bottom—food, water, shelter. Safety one level up. Then love and belonging. Then esteem. Self-actualization at the top.

(Description: Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs pyramid with five colored layers. At the base: Physiological Needs (pink/red) listing "Air, Water, Food, Shelter (& housing), protection from exposure), Clothing, Sleep, Reproduction." Next layer: Safety Needs (peach) with "Personal Security (no violence, crime, war), Health & Wellbeing, Stable Environment, Order & Law." Third: Love & Belonging (yellow) listing "Family, Friendship, Community, Romantic Relationships, Desire for Membership, Affection & Intimacy." Fourth: Esteem (green) with "Self Respect, Confidence, Achievement from Others, Recognition, Respect & Reputation." At the top: Self-Actualization (blue) showing "Realizing one's full potential", "Creativity, Personal Growth, Moral Development, Pursuit of Meaning, Purpose-Driven Action, Peak Experience (joy, transcendence, insight).")

The idea was simple: you can't worry about finding your life's purpose when you're starving. Survival first, meaning later. For 80 years, most of the global economy has been organized around that bottom layer—growing food, building houses, manufacturing goods, transporting stuff, managing the logistics of keeping 8 billion people alive.

Now think about what AI, robotics, and cheap energy are doing right now.

Tesla's Optimus robot is targeting the $40 trillion global labor market—starting with repetitive physical tasks. FSD is attacking transportation costs. Solar and battery storage have dropped in cost by over 90% in the past decade, and they're still falling thanks to Wright's Law—the idea that every time cumulative production doubles, costs drop by a predictable percentage. Vertical farming is cutting food costs by removing up to 60% of what you pay at the grocery store, which is really just transportation, storage, and handling. 3D printing is reducing construction costs by 30 to 50 percent in pilot programs.

## All of this is attacking the same thing: the bottom of Maslow's pyramid.

Food, shelter, energy, physical safety—the stuff that has organized human economic activity for all of recorded history, and AI and robotics are systematically making all of it cheaper, faster. Peter Diamandis has been saying for years that the cost of housing, transportation, food, healthcare, and education will eventually approach zero. That used to sound like hyperbole to me, but increasingly it just sounds early.

So what happens when the bottom of the pyramid gets solved? What happens when machines grow the food, build the houses, generate the energy, and drive the cars?

The economy doesn't disappear—it migrates to the top of the pyramid, to the things machines fundamentally cannot provide. Belonging, love, empathy, creative expression, purpose, the search for meaning.

Now, the bears and the haters will say this is utopian fantasy. That we're nowhere close to solving basic needs for everyone. That billions of people still live in poverty. Fair enough—they're right about the current state, but they're wrong about the trajectory.

Wright's Law doesn't care about your skepticism. When Tesla doubles battery production again—and they will—costs drop another 15 to 20 percent. When Optimus goes from 50,000 units to 10 million units per year, the cost of robotic labor falls off a cliff. The curves are exponential, and they're already bending.

I think the truth is somewhere in the middle, but biased much more towards the bull's side.

## Let's look at what's already happening.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics says the fastest-growing occupation in America is home health and personal care aides. Adding 739,800 new positions by 2034. The largest growth of any occupation in the country. These are connection jobs—caring for people, being present with them, offering empathy and support, the kind of work that AI is terrible at.

Meanwhile, the global coaching industry hit $5.34 billion in 2025 and is growing at 8.53% per year. Mental health counseling is at $12.54 billion and growing at over 10% annually. The overall mental health market is $460 billion globally. The therapy market, the coaching market, the wellness market—all of them are growing faster than most tech sectors.

Why? Because people are drowning in loneliness while surrounded by more technology than any generation in history.

The numbers are staggering. 58% of Americans report feeling invisible. Let me say that differently—more than half the country feels like nobody sees them. Among Gen Z, 80% report feelings of isolation. The US Surgeon General declared loneliness a public health epidemic. The World Health Organization issued an advisory in June 2025 linking social disconnection directly to increased risk of death. Chronic loneliness increases your risk of dying prematurely by 29%—comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

## This is a market signal. A massive one.

From my perspective, what we're watching is a scarcity inversion. For most of human history, the scarce resource was physical stuff—calories, shelter, warmth, safety. So economies organized around producing and distributing physical stuff. But as AI and robotics make physical stuff abundant, the new scarcity becomes emotional. Connection, meaning, purpose, empathy—the stuff humans need just as desperately as food and water, but that machines fundamentally cannot provide.

Think about it this way. Generative AI has made content functionally infinite. Any image, any text, any video—you can produce it in seconds. The average person already encounters 6,000 to 10,000 commercial messages per day. They consciously notice fewer than 100 and engage with fewer than 10. Content is abundant and attention is scarce, but even attention is the wrong frame.

What's actually scarce? Genuine human connection—someone who actually sees you, someone who actually cares, a conversation where both people are fully present, an experience that feels real. That's the scarcity of the 21st century. The economy will follow the scarcity—it always does.

The empathy premium is already measurable in corporate data, and the numbers are hard to ignore. The top 10 companies in the Global Empathy Index increased in value more than twice as much as the bottom 10. They generated 50% more earnings, and 91% of CEOs surveyed said they believe their company's financial performance is directly tied to empathy in the workplace. Love and empathy aren't soft, fuzzy concepts that belong in a self-help book—they're economic variables that drive revenue and predict market cap growth.

## Now let me steel man the other side.

The biggest problem with the "meaning economy" thesis is the transition. The middle 60% of the socioeconomic ladder—the people who currently work bottom-of-pyramid jobs in manufacturing, logistics, transportation, food service, construction—they're going to get disrupted before the meaning economy is ready to absorb them. This is the barbell effect I've talked about before. The top 20% thrives because they own capital and can deploy AI. The bottom 20% eventually benefits from dramatically cheaper goods and services. The middle 60% gets crushed during the transition.

That's real, and it's my biggest concern—optimistic about the destination, pessimistic about the journey.

There's another problem too. Care jobs—the single largest source of new jobs in America—pay terribly. Under $35,000 a year. So the economy is telling us it values care and connection through job growth, but it's not paying for it yet. That's a market failure, and it won't fix itself without either policy intervention or a dramatic restructuring of how we value emotional labor.

There's also the AI companion question. What if people don't seek out real human connection when they're lonely? What if they turn to AI chatbots, virtual companions, simulated relationships? Research from Carnegie Mellon and others shows that AI chatbots don't make meaningful demands of their users. Real relationships require negotiation, compromise, sacrifice—and that's precisely what makes them valuable. AI companions offer comfort without growth. There's a real risk that a significant portion of the population accepts the simulation instead of doing the harder work of genuine connection.

## But having said all that, the underlying economics still point the same direction.

The convergence of AI, robotics, and cheap energy—what I've called The Convergence in my work—doesn't just solve physical problems. It creates the conditions for an entirely new economic order. When energy is nearly free and robots handle physical labor, the economic question stops being "how do we produce enough stuff" and starts being "how do we produce enough meaning."

That's both exciting and terrifying at the same time—exciting because a meaning economy is fundamentally more humane than a survival economy, terrifying because most people have never had to answer the question "what do I actually want?" without the structure of economic necessity forcing the answer.

For fourteen years, I've watched Elon Musk build companies that attack the bottom of the pyramid. Tesla makes energy and transportation cheaper, SpaceX makes space access cheaper. The whole thesis has always been about abundance—making the physical world cheaper, faster, better. But I don't think even the most dedicated Tesla bulls and fans have fully processed where that road ends.

It ends at the top of the pyramid, with love, belonging, meaning, and self-actualization becoming the primary economic drivers—empathy as a competitive advantage and loneliness as the biggest market failure of the century.

For investors, this means the "meaning economy"—therapy platforms, coaching services, wellness technology, community platforms, authentic experience companies, care infrastructure—is massively undervalued. Mental health alone is a $460 billion global market growing toward $580 billion by 2034. Coaching is growing at nearly 9% per year. These growth rates will accelerate as AI takes over more survival-economy jobs and people confront the question of purpose directly.

There's a concept in psychology called the "existential vacuum"—it's what happens when people lose the external structure that gave their life meaning. Viktor Frankl wrote about it after surviving the Holocaust. He observed that people could endure almost anything as long as they had a reason to. The danger of solving survival is that you remove the most common reason people had—staying alive—without replacing it with something else.

## That replacement is the trillion-dollar opportunity.

The companies and individuals who figure out how to help people find meaning, build genuine connection, and pursue self-actualization in a world where machines handle everything else—they're going to capture enormous value.

I'm 90% invested in Tesla. I have skin in the game on the "solve the bottom of the pyramid" bet. But I'm increasingly paying attention to what happens after that bet pays off. Because the Maslow flip—the inversion of what the economy values—might be the biggest economic story of the next two decades.

Bigger than Robotaxis, bigger than Optimus, bigger than AGI itself—those technologies solve the physics while the meaning economy solves the people.

I could be wrong about the timeline. Maybe it takes 30 years instead of 15. Maybe the transition is even messier than I'm imagining. But the direction seems clear to me, and I've been looking at this long enough to trust the pattern.

## So I'll put this on record: by 2035, "meaning economy" will be a standard term in financial analysis.

Care work will be among the highest-compensated professions. Empathy will be measured on corporate balance sheets the way we currently measure R&D spending. The companies that figure out human connection at scale will be worth more than the companies that figured out cloud computing.

That's on the record now—if it's wrong, come back in nine years and call me retarded.

But if I'm right—and I think I am—the most valuable skill in an AI-powered economy won't be coding or engineering or data science. It'll be the ability to make another person feel seen.

The machines will handle everything else.
