## Opening

Matt Shumer published an article yesterday called "Something Big Is Happening." If you haven't read it yet, stop what you're doing and go read it. Then come back here. Because what he described isn't a prediction. It's a status report.

AI is building entire applications from scratch. Testing them. Debugging them. Shipping them. Not assisting a developer. Replacing the developer. GPT-5.3 Codex and Opus 4.6 dropped on February 5th and the game changed overnight. Not gradually. Overnight.

Here's the part that should make you uncomfortable: GPT-5.3 Codex was used to debug its own training process. AI is now improving AI. The feedback loop has started and it's accelerating.

Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, is predicting 50% of entry-level white collar jobs gone in one to five years. Not ten. Not twenty. One to five.

And most business owners I talk to? They think they're ready. They're not even close.

## The Dangerous Illusion of Being "Prepared"

Here's what I see every single week in my DMs, on calls, in my cohorts. Business owners who tried ChatGPT in 2023, thought it was cool but overhyped, and went back to business as usual. They formed their opinion on AI two years ago and never updated it.

That's like test driving a golf cart in 2023 and deciding you don't need to worry about Teslas in 2026.

The AI you dismissed? It doesn't exist anymore. What exists now is something fundamentally different. Something that can do entire jobs, not just answer questions.

### False Security Measures

Most businesses think they're AI-proof because they've done one or two of these things:

**"We use ChatGPT for emails."** Great. You're using a rocket ship as a paperweight.

**"We hired an AI consultant."** Cool. Did anything actually change in your operations? Or did you get a nice PDF and a Zoom recording?

**"Our industry is different."** No it's not. Shumer's whole point is that every knowledge work field is getting hit simultaneously. Legal. Finance. Marketing. Development. Design. Content. All of it. At once.

**"We'll adapt when we need to."** This is the most dangerous one. By the time you "need to," your competitors who started six months earlier will be operating at 10x your efficiency with half your headcount. You don't adapt to a tidal wave while it's hitting you. You see it coming and move to higher ground.

The businesses that think they're prepared are running the playbook from 2024. The world moved on.

## The 5 Ways to Actually Be AI-Proof

I've spent the last two years building an AI agency, launching products with AI tools, and teaching thousands of people how to build with this technology. Here's what I've learned about what actually makes a business resilient in this new world.

### 1. Become the Orchestrator, Not the Operator

The old model: you hire people to do tasks. The new model: you hire fewer people who are exceptional at directing AI to do tasks.

This is not about replacing your team. It's about transforming what your team does. The person who used to spend 40 hours a week writing code now spends 10 hours directing AI to write code and 30 hours on architecture, strategy, and quality control.

The businesses that survive will be the ones where every employee becomes a manager of AI systems. Not eventually. Now.

**Practical step:** Pick your most repetitive, time-intensive workflow. This week. Build an AI system that handles 80% of it. Use the freed up time for higher value work. Repeat.

### 2. Own Your Distribution

Here's something AI can't replace: your audience. Your relationships. Your trust.

AI can write content. AI can build products. AI can do customer research. But AI can't be you. It can't have your specific story, your track record, your reputation in a market.

The people who will thrive are the ones who built an audience before AI made content creation trivially easy. Because when everyone can create, the bottleneck becomes attention and trust. Not production.

If you don't have distribution today, you're already behind. But behind is better than invisible.

**Practical step:** Pick one platform. Post daily for 90 days. Share what you're learning, building, and thinking about AI in your industry. The people who document this transition publicly will become the authorities in their space.

### 3. Build Products, Not Just Services

Service businesses are the most vulnerable to AI disruption. If your entire business model is "we do X for clients," you need to ask yourself: can AI do X? If the answer is yes, or even "partially," your margins are about to compress dramatically.

The move is to use AI to build products that solve the same problems your services solve, but at scale. Productize your expertise. Turn your process into software. Use tools like Lovable to build and ship products in days, not months.

I'm not saying abandon services overnight. I'm saying start building the product arm of your business today so that when service margins compress (and they will), you have something that scales without headcount.

**Practical step:** Look at your most common client deliverable. Ask yourself: could this be a product instead of a custom project? Build a v1 this month using AI tools. Test it with five existing clients.

### 4. Move Faster Than Everyone Else

Speed is the ultimate competitive advantage right now. Not because being fast is inherently good, but because the gap between "early adopter" and "late adopter" in AI is enormous. And it's getting bigger every month.

The business that implements AI workflows today will compound that advantage daily. Every day you wait, the gap between you and your AI-native competitor gets wider.

Shumer described AI that can build and test entire applications. That capability exists right now. The question is whether you're using it or whether your competitor is using it while you're still "evaluating options."

There has never been a better time to be fast and scrappy. The tools are cheap. The capabilities are insane. The only thing stopping most businesses is the same thing that always stops them: hesitation.

**Practical step:** Set a rule for your team. No AI initiative takes longer than two weeks to test. If you can't validate it in two weeks, scope it down until you can. Speed of iteration beats quality of planning every single time right now.

### 5. Invest in Taste and Judgment

This is the contrarian one. Everyone is talking about AI skills. Prompt engineering. Technical literacy. That stuff matters. But the real differentiator in an AI-saturated world is taste.

When AI can produce unlimited content, code, designs, and strategies, the person who can look at all of that output and say "this is good, this is garbage, this is what the market actually wants" becomes incredibly valuable.

Taste is the ability to curate, direct, and judge quality. It comes from experience. From deep knowledge of your market. From understanding what resonates with real humans.

AI is an incredible producer. But it's a mediocre editor. The human with great taste and AI tools will destroy the human with no taste and the same AI tools.

**Practical step:** Spend time consuming great work in your field. Study what's working. Develop strong opinions about quality. The more opinionated you are about what "good" looks like, the better you'll be at directing AI to produce it.

## What I'm Doing About It

I'm not writing this from the sidelines. I'm in the middle of it.

At Creme Digital, we've restructured our entire agency around AI-native workflows. Every team member is expected to use AI in their daily work. Not as a nice-to-have. As a requirement. Our output per person has more than doubled in the last six months. We're doing more with a leaner team and the quality is higher, not lower.

I'm building products with Lovable and shipping them in days. Things that would have taken a dev team months are getting built, tested, and launched in a week. That's not an exaggeration. That's Tuesday.

I'm teaching cohorts of builders how to do the same thing. Because I genuinely believe the biggest opportunity of our lifetime is right now, in the next 12 to 24 months, for people who learn to build with AI.

And I'm sharing everything publicly. On X. On LinkedIn. Because the people who document this shift and help others navigate it will build the most valuable audiences and businesses of the next decade.

## The Bottom Line

Matt Shumer is right. Something big is happening. But reading about it and acting on it are two very different things.

Most businesses will read articles like his, nod along, and do nothing. They'll keep running the 2024 playbook in a 2026 world. And they'll wonder why their margins are shrinking and their competitors are moving faster.

Don't be most businesses.

The playbook is simple. Not easy, but simple. Become the orchestrator. Own your distribution. Build products. Move fast. Develop taste.

The intelligence explosion has started. The feedback loop is accelerating. AI is building better AI. And the window to position yourself on the right side of this shift is open right now. It won't be open forever.

So the question isn't whether AI will change your business. It will. The question is whether you'll be the one directing that change or reacting to it.

I know which side I'm on.

If you want help figuring out which side you're on, follow along. I'm posting about this every day. And if you want to go deeper, my cohorts are where people go from "I should probably learn AI" to "I just built and shipped a product in a week."

The future belongs to the builders. Start building.
