If you are working/vibe coding more than 40min per day you are within 0.01% of users using it the most.
You are not late.
This is the part where everything feels too late but it's only because we are so early and everyone is scrambling.
(Description: Chart titled "How long does Claude Code work before stopping?" (99.9th percentile). Line graph showing "Turn duration (minutes)" on Y-axis (ranging from ~20 to ~47 minutes) and "Date" on X-axis (spanning from 2025-10-01 to 2026-02-15). The orange line shows an upward trend starting around 23 minutes in October 2025, climbing steadily through November and December 2025, peaking around 47 minutes in late January 2026, then declining to around 40 minutes by mid-February 2026. Three vertical dashed lines marked "Claude 3.5" indicate model releases.)

Why can't you?
There more than labour cost, design and ease to replicate.
Meta isn't meta because no one can replicate but because of net work effects for example.
The value proposition and most setup is changing but value can be achieved.
