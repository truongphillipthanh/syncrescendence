## Description (no transcript available)

Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 establishes a new standard for coding and agentic tool use by outperforming peers on SWEBench and agentic terminal benchmarks. Results show big gains in coding tasks and token efficiency, while some non-coding evaluations remain weaker than certain competitors. 
New capabilities: tool search, programmatic tool calling, and standardized tool-use examples aim to enable scalable agents with deep IDE and deployment pipeline integration across thousands of external tools.
