## Description (no transcript available)

Detroit is trying to pull off the impossible: turning the rust belt into the "American Shenzhen." In this episode, we travel to the Motor City to see if a mix of old-school grit and new-school software can actually bring manufacturing back to the US. We go inside the "Re-industrialize" conference, interview the robot form of Palmer Luckey and visit the shop floor of Atomic Industries, a startup attempting to save the dying art of tool and die making by training AI to master the trade. It’s a story about the intersection of "ruin prn" and high-tech hope, where founders are betting that the future of American industry isn't in a clean Silicon Valley office, but in the grime of a revitalized factory floor.

(This is Part Two of our Detroit series. The first episode is here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a1_Sv28qa8)

We also meet Andy Didorosi - https://www.youtube.com/@thatdetroitandy  

He's a YouTuber and entrepreneur who bought a 55,000-square-foot car factory for the price of a Bay Area studio apartment. From his remote-controlled firetrucks to his battles with scrappers, Didorosi embodies the hustle that the city demands. This isn’t just a tour of cool machines; it’s a look at the hard reality of building hardware in 2026. Join us as we explore whether the US can relearn how to make things before it’s too late, and why some believe that when it comes to innovation, comfort is the enemy and Detroit is the cure.
