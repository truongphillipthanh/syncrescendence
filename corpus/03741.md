## Claim (7)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260207-012-0001
**Lines**: 10-12
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.00, consensus_pressure=0.90, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.90

> The more details of daily life that can be handed over to automatism, the more higher powers of mind will be set free for their proper work, as articulated by William James in 1890.

**Lines**: 25-27
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> LLM attention degrades as context fills, meaning instruction-based routine checks degrade precisely when they matter most.

**Lines**: 39-41
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Instructions require executive function, and since executive function degrades under load, instructions also degrade.

> A PostToolUse hook on the Write tool ensures quality checking becomes an infrastructure guarantee rather than a cognitive task, as it fires on every write operation regardless of context fill, agent attention, or task complexity.

**Lines**: 63-65
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Schema validation after every write, when implemented as a hook, addresses inhibitory control, which is the function that prevents inappropriate actions and is the first to degrade under cognitive load.

**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Auto-commits, enabled by hooks, address prospective memory (remembering to do X at time Y), a cognitive function with high failure rates even for motivated adults.

**Lines**: 70-72
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Session initialization hooks, which inject workspace context at startup, address working memory bootstrapping by ensuring the agent begins with necessary anchors without needing to remember to load its operating state.

## Concept (3)

**Lines**: 15-16
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Expertise is not knowing more things, but rather automatizing enough things that executive function can focus on what matters.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260207-012-0005
**Lines**: 46-49
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Hooks are an architectural parallel to human habits, firing on lifecycle events (like writing a file or starting a session) to produce automatic operations without reasoning, thereby freeing cognitive resources for higher-order work.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260207-012-0007
**Lines**: 55-58
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Hooks serve as the agent's habit system, replacing the missing basal ganglia by externalizing habit formation through event-triggered infrastructure, analogous to how humans automatize through neural plasticity.
