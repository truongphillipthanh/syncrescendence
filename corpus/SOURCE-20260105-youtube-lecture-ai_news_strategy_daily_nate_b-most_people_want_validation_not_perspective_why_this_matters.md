What's really happening with AI and personal career development? The common story is that career coaching is reserved for Silicon Valley executives who can afford it — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on building an AI board of directors to hold yourself accountable:
• Why nobody is watching your career except you 
• How we are all unreliable narrators of our own progress 
• What a quarterly self-report should actually include 
• How LLMs can instantiate multiple perspectives in one session

Chapters:
0:00 The hidden gap in career development 
02:28 Why your career has no governance structure 
04:39 We are unreliable narrators of ourselves 
05:52 The external scaffold high performers use 
06:31 Building an AI board of directors 
07:41 Why you're more honest with AI than humans 
09:00 Creating your quarterly career report 
10:00 The document designed to invite scrutiny 
11:00 Instantiating your board with meta prompts 
12:20 Director cards and the board conversation 
13:30 A new era of scaled accountability

We require public companies to have boards because smart people make bad decisions when nobody is watching. Your career deserves the same governance structure — and now AI makes that possible at scale.

For professionals serious about leveling up, this system offers real accountability — but only if you're willing to be genuinely honest with yourself.
