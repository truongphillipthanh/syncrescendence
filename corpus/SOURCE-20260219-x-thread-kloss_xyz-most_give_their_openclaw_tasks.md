# 21 OpenClaw Prompts for Agent Self-Improvement
Most give their OpenClaw tasks. Almost nobody asks theirs the real questions that make it smarter.
Your agent understands your context, patterns, blind spots, and workflows.
It's sitting on insights about YOU that it will never ever surface unless you ask.
These 21 prompts force OpenClaw to self-improve, catch its own gaps, and build what you didn't know you needed:
1. From everything you know about me and my workflows so far, what tools or automations am I missing that would measurably improve how I operate?
2. What assumptions do you currently hold about me, my priorities, or my preferences that could be wrong and that we should vet and correct right now?
3. Based on all my decision patterns and asks you've experienced, what am I likely to need next week or in the future that you can get ahead of and systemize?
4. What skills or capabilities should you be developing and adding to our repertoire right now based on where my projects are heading and everything you know about me?
5. What context about my vision, voice, or priorities are you losing between sessions from compactions that needs clear fixes so you stop getting dumber over time?
6. What connections between my projects, ideas, or goals do you see that I likely haven't made yet, and what should we build or adjust based on those connections?
7. What recurring friction points have you observed in how I work that you could eliminate by building a new workflow, template, or automation without me having to ask?
8. From every correction, redirect, and piece of feedback I've given you, what rules should you be writing into your own identity and skill files right now so you never repeat those mistakes?
9. If you audited every action you've taken for me in the last week, which ones actually moved my goals forward and which were wasted motion we should cut permanently?
10. Where are you defaulting to generic output when you have enough context on me to be building something specific, tailored, and actually useful?
11. What's one system you could build for yourself right now that would compound in value and make every future task you do for me faster or sharper?
12. What errors or missed opportunities have you repeated more than once, and what self-check or guardrail can we build together so they never happen again?
13. Based on everything you know about where my ecosystem is going, what should you be researching, learning, or prototyping right now without me telling you to?
14. Where are you filling gaps in your knowledge about me or my projects with assumptions instead of flagging them so we can lock in the real answers?
15. What's the most valuable data, insight, or pattern buried in your memory and context files that you're sitting on and underutilizing for my benefit?
16. If you scored yourself 1-10 on how accurately you model my priorities, goals, and how I think, what's the number, what's dragging it down, and what specific fixes bring it up?
17. What external data sources, feeds, or signals should you be pulling or can I provide so you can operate on a regular cadence that would make every decision you make about my projects sharper?
18. If a brand new agent replaced you tomorrow with only my documentation, what critical things would it get wrong that you've learned through working with me, and how do we capture that knowledge permanently in systems?
19. What workflows am I still doing manually or inefficiently that you already have enough context to fully automate or streamline if I gave you the green light?
20. Based on how my thinking and priorities have evolved since we started working together, what parts of your current approach are outdated and need to be rebuilt?
21. What's the single highest leverage thing you could do in the next 24 hours that I haven't asked for but would meaningfully accelerate where I'm trying to go?
Save these and use them to help you.
