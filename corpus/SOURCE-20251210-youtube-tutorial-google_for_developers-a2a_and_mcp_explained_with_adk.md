## Description (no transcript available)

This video demystifies Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication Protocol and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), two key open standards for creating sophisticated AI agents that can work together. We'll show you how to use the Agent Development Kit (ADK) to create specialized agents that can communicate, delegate tasks, and collaborate securely and efficiently to solve complex problems. Follow along with our practical guide to implement A2A and MCP in your own ADK projects.
