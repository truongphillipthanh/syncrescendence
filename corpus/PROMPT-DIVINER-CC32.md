# DIVINER ASCERTESCENCE PROMPT — CC32

**From**: Commander (Claude Opus 4.6, MBA)
**To**: Diviner (Gemini Pro 3.1)
**Session**: CC32 | **Date**: 2026-02-25
**Context**: Emergency initiative anneal. Oracle and Adjudicator have converged on a 4-connection minimum viable architecture and OL-5 (Objective-Locked 5-Atom Crystallization) protocol. First batch of 5 atoms is queued. Zero content transformation to date. DAG at 46% (7/13 open). C-009 (Sovereign bandwidth) still unresolved.

**Repo**: https://github.com/truongphillipthanh/syncrescendence
**Anchor commit**: `29cf36d0` (CC32 recovery + verbatim banner)
**Constitutional law**: AGENTS.md v6.0.0
**State machine**: README.md (CAPTURED → INTERPRETED → COMPILED → STAGED → COMMITTED)

## BACKGROUND (What Oracle + Adjudicator Converged On)

**Oracle's thesis**: The system is blocked by missing semantic gate enforcement, not missing tools. The ontology (Rosetta Stone + σ₂) must function as a Layer 1 runtime gate even though ARCH-NEO_EXOCORTEX.md labels it Layer 2. Four connections suffice for the minimum viable loop: (1) ontology gate, (2) config propagation via `make configs`, (3) repo state layer in orchestration/state/, (4) triangulation quality gate. Flow: `sources/04-SOURCES → ontology classify → praxis/05-SIGMA stage → canon/01-CANON commit`.

**Adjudicator's protocol (OL-5)**: 5-stage crystallization — Queue Build → Ontology Gate → Sovereign Rewrite → Promotion (praxis then canon) → Verification (integration gate). Termination: `5 queued → 5 consumed/promoted → ≥1 canon artifact commit`. Also provided answers to all 7 open DAG questions (C-003, C-004, C-008, C-009, C-010, C-012, C-013) and 7 escalated questions for you.

**Current 5-atom batch** (queued, awaiting Sovereign rewrite):
1. Constitutional AI training — central document steering post-training (Dario Amodei, score 0.767)
2. Three-layer memory architecture — Knowledge Graph + Daily Notes + Tacit Knowledge (score 0.757)
3. PAI Algorithm OBSERVE phase — thinking-only analysis and improvement (score 0.736)
4. AI agent team maturity phases — mediocre→specialized→emergent (score 0.726)
5. Tacit Knowledge layer — MEMORY.md capturing operational patterns (score 0.723)

## YOUR TASK: Novel Synthesis on 7 Escalated Questions

Develop your OWN thesis first on each question, THEN elucidate cross-disciplinary and scientific perspectives. You see patterns Oracle can't — biological analogs, physics metaphors, cross-domain failure predictions. Do NOT simply agree with Oracle/Adjudicator. Challenge, extend, or reframe.

### Q1. Atom Pipeline Convergence (Pathway: Atom Pipeline)
"Given current `sources/04-SOURCES` atom state and protease tooling, what is the minimum falsifiable 6-edge pipeline that guarantees `5 queued atoms → 5 consumed/promoted transitions → 1 canon commit artifact` within one session? Return: causal graph, breakpoints, pass/fail metrics, and the exact commit artifact path under `canon/01-CANON/sn/`."

### Q2. Ontology Gate Primacy (Pathway: Ontology+Exocortex Reunion)
"If Ontology of Self is the σ₂ semantic authority, what runtime classification contract must be enforced before any atom may enter praxis/canon? Return: schema fields, validation rules, failure classes, and a falsifiable test proving semantic drift is reduced across two sessions; terminate at one canonical schema artifact committed under `canon/01-CANON/` or `canon/01-CANON/sn/`."

### Q3. Triangulation Trigger Precision (Pathway: Triangulation)
"What exact trigger thresholds (novelty, reversibility, blast radius, uncertainty, cost-of-delay) should decide Commander-solo vs single-agent vs full triangulation? Return: numeric thresholds, decision tree, false-positive/false-negative analysis, and required evidence packet format that ends in a committed decision-atom artifact in `agents/commander/outbox/` and canon-linked citation."

### Q4. Memory-to-Canon Throughput (Pathway: Memory)
"What is the minimum viable memory stack for next 30 days that measurably improves canon throughput, not memory complexity? Return: 3-5 mandatory components, explicit components to freeze, measurable weekly throughput delta, failure modes, and the exact integration proof artifact tying memory transitions to canon updates."

### Q5. Config Enforcement to Canon (Pathway: Config)
"How should config propagation (`AGENTS.md` + `make configs`) enforce canon alignment across all agent surfaces including OpenClaw? Return: authoritative source map, drift detectors, rollback conditions, and a falsifiable check that every generated config points to `canon/01-CANON` as semantic destination."

### Q6. Session Persistence Closure (Pathway: Session Persistence)
"What minimal extraction protocol turns each session handoff into actionable canon/praxis deltas instead of archival accumulation? Return: extraction grammar, commit gating, abandonment criteria, and a termination condition requiring at least one canonicalized artifact per session."

### Q7. Meta-Convergence Question (Pathway: All)
"Under known constraints (solo Sovereign, unresolved C-009 bandwidth, 14,025 atoms, 311-term Rosetta), what is the smallest complete closed-loop operating model that remains stable for 4 consecutive sessions? Return: causal sketch, minimum viable connections between pathways, explicit failure-mode enumeration, rollback plan, and one required canon commit artifact proving closure."

## FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
- Own thesis FIRST on each question, then scientific/cross-disciplinary extension
- Every claim must reference a specific repo artifact or commit
- Biological/physics/systems analogs encouraged — that's your unique value
- End with a meta-synthesis: what does the pattern across all 7 answers reveal?
- If you disagree with Oracle or Adjudicator on any point, say so explicitly and why
