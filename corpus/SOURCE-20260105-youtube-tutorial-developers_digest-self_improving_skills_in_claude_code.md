Setting Up Self-Improving Skills in Claude Code: Manual & Automatic Methods

In this video, you'll learn how to set up self-improving skills within Claude Code. The tutorial addresses the key problem of Large Language Models (LLMs) not learning from previous interactions, causing repeated corrections in coding tasks. The solution involves creating a reflex skill that can analyze sessions, extract corrections, and update skill files. The video outlines both manual and automatic methods to implement these skills, leveraging Git version control for iterative improvements. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to continuously improve your coding harness, ensuring more efficient and less redundant coding sessions.
