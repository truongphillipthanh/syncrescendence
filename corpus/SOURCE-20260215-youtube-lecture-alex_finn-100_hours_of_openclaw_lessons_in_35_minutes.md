Please schedule a morning brief for me every day at 8am. Send it to my Telegram. In this morning brief I want:
1. The weather in San Francisco
2. Top news stories in AI
3. Any tasks I have in my todo list on Things 3
4. Tasks you can complete for me today that bring me closer to my goals

I want you to set up a Mission Control. This is a custom place for us to build out any tools we need to be more productive. Please build this using NextJS and host it locally.
