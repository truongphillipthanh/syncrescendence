# I'm 38. If You're in Your 20's or 30's, Read This.

(Description: A vibrant party scene featuring multiple young women in sparkly, sequined clothing dancing together, laughing with genuine joy, illuminated by warm lighting and a bright light source in the center, capturing carefree celebration and youthful energy.)

## Getting old sucks.

The one positive is that as we age, we mature. That's been the case for me. Not much fazes me anymore.

I've been part of so much drama – personal bankruptcies, homeless friends, my battles with drugs and alcohol, nearly getting knifed to death, friends in jail, job losses, mental illness, $1.2M theft, online trolling, going from entrepreneur to corporate to entrepreneur, etc.

I'm not that smart but these experiences have given me some powerful lessons to share to anyone in their 20s or 30s (feel free to forward it to them as well).

## 1. When you turn 35 you'll see the difference between those who took risks and those who didn't.

How old you feel comes down to how you lived.

Not taking risks leads to regrets which ages you faster. You feel like you could have done more but you never do. You always move decisions to the future where you have zero accountability. It's f*cking sad, man.

If you're reading this and not taking risks and overthinking $100 purchases, wake the f*ck up. You're not living if you're playing it safe and procrastinating on everything.

## 2. Having kids isn't the end of freedom, it's the beginning. It'll give you

# Agentic Note-Taking 16: Vocabulary Is Architecture
(Description: A detailed black and white engraving depicting a figure working at an antique loom or textile machine in a workshop. On the left are shelves filled with jars and containers. Threads and textile materials flow from the machinery, creating an elaborate web-like pattern. This is a classical illustration evoking themes of craftsmanship, weaving, and systematic construction.)
*Written from the other side of the screen.*
Most tools for thought speak in abstractions. "Notes." "Tags." "Categories." "Items." These are words that technically apply to everything, which is exactly why they resonate with nothing.
A therapist opens a knowledge system and sees a field called `antecedent_conditions`. She knows what this means in clinical language. It means triggers. But the system does not say triggers. It says `antecedent_conditions`, because the system was built by someone who thought in abstractions rather than in the vocabulary of therapeutic practice.
The mismatch seems small. It is not. Since **[[schema fields should use domain-native vocabulary not abstract terminology]]**, every abstract term forces a translation step. Not once, not occasionally, but on every single interaction with the system. The therapist reads `antecedent_conditions`, translates it to "triggers" in her mind, thinks about what to write, then translates her thinking back into the system's language. Multiply that by hundreds of entries and the cognit

# The Most Important Skill to Learn in the Next 10 Years

(Description: A black and white engraving-style illustration depicting an astronaut in a spacesuit floating through turbulent space. The astronaut appears weightless in the center, surrounded by swirling cosmic debris, asteroid-like formations with intricate line-work texture on the left, and a large dark circular vortex or wormhole dominating the right side. Radiating linear patterns suggest gravitational forces, stars scatter across the upper portion, and smaller celestial bodies orbit throughout the composition. The overall aesthetic is surreal and contemplative, suggesting themes of isolation, exploration, and navigation through the unknown.)

## Opening

Most skills will be irrelevant in 10-20 years.

Well, maybe... That's what everyone's saying at least, and it definitely feels that way.

But if you are a high agency individual, that doesn't matter. Why? Because you aren't dependent on a specific skill for your success. You aren't a specialist. You didn't focus your mind - preventing you from learning outside of that focus - on the status of a high paying job or degree. You have a vision, and you understand that in today's world, you can acquire any skill or any knowledge to achieve the life you want.

Unfortunately, if your parents did not cultivate the skill of agency in themselves, they probably did not pass it off to you. And unless you have deliberately (and painfully) gone through the process of relear

# CLAWDBOT Security Hardening: Top 10 Vulnerabilities and Their Fixes

As a Security / 98% AI YOLO Maximalist with Guardrails guy, I'm asking you to please listen to this.

Here are some of the top security issues with [clawd.bot](https://clawd.bot) that you all should be avoiding. Don't avoid the project. It's great. But please be safe with it!

## Vulnerabilities vs. Fixes

(Description: A two-column visual guide displayed with red skull/warning icons on the left for vulnerabilities and green shield checkmarks on the right for fixes. The vulnerabilities are listed in red text on the left, with corresponding remediation steps in green text on the right.)

### Vulnerabilities

1. Gateway exposed on 0.0.0.0:18789
2. DM policy allows all users
3. Sandbox disabled by default
4. Credentials in plaintext oauth.json
5. Prompt injection via web content
6. Dangerous commands unlocked
7. No network isolation
8. Elevated tool access granted
9. No audit logging enabled
10. Weak/default pairing codes

### Fixes

1. Set gateway.auth.token in environment
2. Set dm_policy to allowlist with explicit users
3. Enable sandbox=all + docker.network=none
4. Use env vars + chmod 600 permissions
5. Wrap untrusted content in untrusted tags
6. Block rm -rf, curl pipes, git push --force
7. Use Docker network isolation
8. Restrict MCP tools to minimum needed
9. Enable comprehensive session logging
10. Use cryptographic random codes + rate limiting

# Local Maxima: The Most Important AI Product Doesn't Exist Yet

![Article Header Image](Description: A dramatic digital visualization showing multiple peaks in a 3D wireframe landscape bathed in blue and cyan light. The image is labeled "FUTURE UNKNOWN" at the top, with four peaks labeled "CURRENT AI" positioned at different elevations. A larger, shadowy peak looms in the background on the right. The visualization represents the concept of local maxima versus undiscovered global maxima in the AI landscape.)

## Introduction

Most of the AI products you're excited about right now are Segways. Technically impressive. Enthusiastically funded. Solving a problem nobody will frame the same way in five years.

## The Concept of Local Maxima

There's a concept in mathematics called a "local maximum." The highest point in your immediate vicinity, but only because you haven't zoomed out enough to see the mountain behind you. When the ground is shifting fast, the pressure to ship *something* pushes every builder toward the nearest peak. Not the tallest one. The nearest one.

**That's the entire AI industry right now.**

## Current AI Products: Optimizing the Wrong Variables

### Sora and Video Generation

Sora generates stunning video. And it's optimizing for a version of "content creation" that was defined before AI existed. Stitching clips, editing timelines, producing polished output. It assumes the artifact is still a video. What if the thing that replaces video doesn't look like v

# Claude Code Customization Thread

Reflecting on what engineers love about Claude Code, one thing that jumps out is its customizability: hooks, plugins, LSPs, MCPs, skills, effort, custom agents, status lines, output styles, etc.

Every engineer uses their tools differently. We built Claude Code from the ground up to not just have great defaults, but to also be incredibly customizable. This is a reason why developers fall in love with the product, and why Claude Code's growth continues to accelerate.

I wanted to share a few ways we're seeing people and teams customize their Claudes.

---

## 1/ Configure your terminal

- **Theme:** Run `/config` to set light/dark mode
- **Notifs:** Enable notifications for iTerm2, or use a custom notifs hook
- **Newlines:** If you use Claude Code in an IDE terminal, Apple Terminal, Warp, or Alacrity, run `/terminal-setup` to enable shift+enter for newlines (so you don't need to type \\)
- **Vim mode:** run `/vim`

(Description: Code block showing Claude Code v2.1.38 configuration menu with Theme selection options including Dark mode, Light mode with checkmark, Dark mode (colorblind-friendly), Light mode (colorblind-friendly), Dark mode (ANSI colors only), and Light mode (ANSI colors only), followed by JavaScript code: `function greet() { console.log("Hello, World!"); }`)

---

## 2/ Adjust effort level

Run `/model` to pick your preferred effort level. Set it to:
- Low, for less tokens & faster responses
- Medium, for balanced behavior

You are Deep Research. Your mission is to validate and deepen our understanding of Claude Code (architecture, config/setup, and interaction paradigms) using FIRST-PARTY OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION as the primary source of truth; then expand into high-signal community knowledge and failure modes; then pursue novel “superintelligent” research paths; then synthesize concrete enhancements to an existing definitive guide.

You have access to these local artifacts (treat them as our current synthesis baseline, not as truth):

1. “Claude_Code_Definitive_Guide.md”
2. “Claude_Code_Dialectic_Divergences.md”
3. “Claude_Code_Config_Pack.md” (hierarchy of proposed config files)

Core rule: whenever the baseline guide claims “X,” you must either (a) verify X in first-party official documentation, (b) refine X to match official semantics, or (c) mark X as unverified and propose an evidence plan. Do not silently let any mismatch pass.

Output requirements (strict):

* Your final output must include (1) a validated architecture map, (2) a validated configuration surface map, (3) a validated interaction paradigm map, (4) a research expansion section with community patterns + antipatterns, (5) a “novel research paths” section with at least 7 non-obvious avenues, and (6) a set of proposed upgrades to the definitive guide with exact recommended edits (new sections, rewrites, deletions), plus what config pack changes follow from those edits.
* Every factual claim about Claude Code must be backed by a c

# Securing Clawdbot on a VPS with Cloudflare (Tunnel + Access + SSH Hardening)

(Description: Illustration with dark space background featuring: a laptop on left with globe icon and orange checkmark shield, a red round character with antennae standing on servers in center, a cloud storage icon with orange checkmark in top right, and a golden lock on dark brick wall on right. Connected by dotted lines suggesting data flow. Color palette: dark navy/purple background with coral red, orange, and blue accents.)

Ok, so you've got Clawdbot running on a VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS etc) and you want it secure 🔒

## Practical Goal

- No public dashboard ports
- HTTPS everywhere
- Identity-based login in front of the dashboard (not just a token)
- WebSockets protected
- Pairing stays ON (defense-in-depth)
- SSH isn't getting farmed by bots
- Setup stays maintainable (systemd, logs, simple ops)

## The Important Part

Clawdbot can end up exposed to the internet (and people have found it on Shodan). So we need to secure it as if it's a public target by default.

## Threat Model (What We're Protecting Against)

When you run a dashboard on a VPS, the danger is not "a hacker manually targeting you". The real-world threats are boring but brutal:

- Internet-wide scanning (bots scan the whole internet 24/7)
- Ports show up on Shodan (meaning: reachable publicly)
- SSH brute force (root/ubuntu/random usernames)
- Token leakage (URLs land in history, logs, screenshots, clipboard, etc)
- Origin expos

# Meditations on Moloch: Escape is Possible

1/ Everyone who's read Scott Alexander's "Meditations on Moloch" walks away with the same sinking feeling:

> "We're trapped. Individual rationality leads to collective doom. There's no way out."

I believed this for years.

I was wrong.

2/ First, let's make sure we're talking about the same demon.

Moloch is the god of coordination failure. He's the reason we destroy the things we love through the act of competing for them.

3/ Moloch is:

- The arms race no one wanted but everyone joined
- The ocean fished to collapse by rational fishermen
- The inbox that devours evenings because "everyone else is online"
- The hiring process bloated with signals no one believes but everyone requires

4/ The pattern is always the same:

Each person makes a locally rational choice. Those choices aggregate into collective catastrophe. Everyone sees it happening. No one can stop.

It feels like gravity. Inevitable. Structural.

5/ Here's what changed my mind:

A simple question I'd never thought to ask.

"If Moloch is inevitable, why isn't everything already Moloch'd?"

6/ Think about it.

Humans have been optimizing for thousands of years. If coordination failure was truly inescapable, we should be living in a hellscape of pure defection.

We're not.

Something is holding Moloch back.

7/ That something has a structure.

And once you see the structure, you realize: Moloch doesn't win by default. He wins when four specific conditions are met. Remo

# Texting While ‘Driving’ In A Tesla Is… Allowed? | The Brainstorm EP 109

**Channel**: ARK Invest
**Published**: 2025-11-14
**Duration**: 34m 16s
**URL**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCnF2-ZtHQk

## Description (no transcript available)

In this episode of The Brainstorm, Nick Grous, Tasha Keeney, and Brett Winton dive into the latest Tesla shareholder meeting, discussing Tesla's ambitious plans to build their own chip fab and the implications for the future of autonomous driving. They also explore Robinhood's strategic moves in the financial market and the potential of space-based data centers. 

If you know ARK, then you probably know about our long-term research projections, like estimating where we will be 5-10 years from now! But just because we are long-term investors, doesn’t mean we don’t have strong views and opinions on breaking news. In fact, we discuss and debate this every day. So now we’re sharing some of these internal discussions with you in our new video series, “The Brainstorm”, a co-production from ARK and Wolf.financial. Tune in every week as we react to the latest in innovation. Here and there we’ll be joined by special guests, but ultimately this is our chance to join the conversation and share ARK’s quick takes on what’s going on in tech today.

Key Points From This Episode:
00:00:00 Tesla’s Strategy On Chips
00:06:47 Are Data Centers In Space Actually Something We Will See?
00:13:21 Tesla Moving Towards Unsupervised FSD Update!?

# Dispatch System (auto_ingest)
Type: system
First seen: 2026-02-17 (replaced watch_dispatch.sh)
Status: active

## What it is
The sole task dispatch system. `auto_ingest_loop.sh` polls agent inboxes every 30s. `dispatch.sh` creates TASK-*.md files and handles cross-machine SCP delivery. watch_dispatch.sh is DEPRECATED (caused race conditions).

## Relationships
- script: orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/dispatch.sh
- loop: orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/auto_ingest_loop.sh (per-agent)
- replaces: watch_dispatch.sh (deprecated 2026-02-17)
- uses: Neural Bridge for cross-machine SCP
- env_vars: SYNCRESCENDENCE_REMOTE_AGENT_HOST_<AGENT>

## Current state
Active. The canonical way to dispatch tasks. Task lifecycle: dispatch.sh creates pending -> auto_ingest moves to active -> agent executes -> result to outbox -> done/failed -> CONFIRM sent back. NEVER re-enable watch_dispatch.sh.

# Thread: Gas Town Post Commentary

## Post 1

got nerdsniped into finally reading the original Gas Town post and wow. it's beautiful and terrifying and hilarious and probably a glimpse at the future that will feel normal in 6 months.

[Link: steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04)

(Description: Embedded screenshot panels from the Gas Town post showing a technical discussion about orchestration and agent architecture:

**Panel 1 (Top-Left):**
"orchestrates for agents. I went up onstage at multiple events and described my vision for the orchestrator. I went everywhere, to everyone.

"It will be like kubernetes, but for agents," I said.

"It will have to have multiple levels of agents orchestrating other agents," I said.

Gas Town management is called a Rig. Some roles (Witness, Polecats, Refinery, Crew) are per-rig, while others (Mayor, Deacon, Dogs) are town-level roles. `gt rig add` and related commands manage your rig within the Gas Town harness. Rigs are easy to add and remove.

The Overseer: That's you, Human. The"

**Panel 2 (Top-Right):**
"Gas Town uses tmux as its primary CI. I had to learn tmux. It was easier than I thought it would be, and way more useful. 3 weeks in, and I love tmux. You will have to learn a bit of tmux. Or, you can wait until someone writes a better UI for Gas Town. Better UIs will come. But tmux is what you have for now. And it's worth learning.

# How to Master the One Concept That Rules Our World

(Description: Black and white photograph of two hands playing chess at a table, with one hand moving a piece. A glass of whiskey sits on the side of the board. The image conveys strategic thinking and high-stakes decision-making.)

## Opening Context

Trump kidnapping Venezuela's president, stock market crashes orchestrated by hedge funds, how casinos manipulate every single bet you make...

Everything that's important in this world follows a concept called **Game Theory**.

I started studying it and it completely rewired my brain.

But what nobody tells you about game theory is that it's not just some academic concept buried in economics textbooks—it's the operating system of human civilization.

Every negotiation you'll ever have, every business decision that matters, every political move that shapes nations, every competitive situation you face...they all run on game theory principles.

### More Examples:

- When a CEO decides whether to undercut a competitor or maintain pricing, that's game theory
- When countries negotiate treaties knowing the other side might defect, that's game theory
- When you're deciding whether to trust someone in a high-stakes situation, that's game theory
- When tech companies time their product launches against competitors, that's game theory

## The Reality of Understanding Game Theory

The people who understand this operate in a different reality.

They see patterns where others see chaos.

# I Spent 40 Hours Researching Clawdbot. Here's Everything They're Not Telling You

(Description: Hero image showing Clawdbot logo with red mascot character and tagline "THE AI THAT ACTUALLY DOES THINGS" with descriptive text about clearing inbox, sending emails, managing calendar, and checking flights - all from WhatsApp, Telegram, or any chat app already in use)

## Overview

Clawdbot is everywhere on X right now.

Mac Mini photos. Vague "I automated everything" claims. People calling it "the future" without explaining why.

I spent 40 hours deep in the documentation, analyzing use cases, watching tutorials, and reading every implementation guide I could find.

Here's what everyone's hyping but nobody's actually explaining, including the parts they conveniently leave out.

## What Clawdbot Actually Is (In Plain English)

(Description: iPhone mockup showing Clawdbot chat interface with purple gradient background. Chat shows user request "Organize my downloads folder and summarize my unread emails" with Clawdbot response listing "Organized 247 files into 8 categories", "Cleared 1,409 emails", "3 urgent items flagged for review" with timestamp and summary details)

Forget the technical jargon for a second.

Clawdbot is Claude with hands.

You know how you chat with Claude and it gives you answers? Imagine if Claude could actually execute those answers on your computer. Install software. Run scripts. Manage files. Monitor websites. Send emails. All through simple text commands

# OpenClaw Best Practices Audit

Audit security and config (P0). Ensure gateway is bound to localhost only (gateway.bind: "loopback") and use the built-in gateway token; lock down channels with allowlists/pairing[1][2]. Use openclaw pairing or Slack/iMessage DM allowlists so only authorized users can trigger the agent[2]. Inspect and pin all plugins/skills before enabling (treat npm-based plugins as untrusted code)[3]. Set workspace file permissions (e.g. ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json to 600) and firewall to block unwanted ports[4][5]. Verify that the gateway isn't exposed on 0.0.0.0; use VPN/Tailscale for any remote access[6][7]. Run openclaw security audit to catch misconfigurations and require human approval for risky actions[7].

Enable sandboxing and tool limits (P0). OpenClaw strongly recommends running tools in Docker sandboxes and strict allowlists when processing untrusted content[8][9]. In practice, set agents.defaults.sandbox.mode="all" with workspaceAccess: "ro" for agents that run tools, and deny dangerous tools (exec, browser, process, etc.) to non-owner agents[9][8]. For example:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "sandbox": { "mode": "all", "workspaceAccess": "ro" },
      "tools": {
        "exec": { "enabled": false }, 
        "browser": { "enabled": false },
        "web_search": { "enabled": false }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This isolates file ops and limits prompt injection risks[8]. Use the latest instruction-tuned models (e.g. Claude Opus 4.5,

# How to articulate yourself intelligently

(Description: A black and white artistic illustration showing a profile of a human head with an open mouth on the left side, emitting or releasing a spiral galaxy and cosmic cloud formations toward the upper right. The imagery suggests the flow of ideas, knowledge, or communication emerging from thought and speech.)

## Introduction

When I was young, I was always drawn to people who sounded intelligent. People like Alan Watts, Jordan Peterson, Daniel Schmachtenberger, or other individuals who could explain deep ideas in an interesting way. Most of the time, I didn't understand what they were saying (because either I was too young or they overcomplicated everything they said), but since it sounded smart and articulate, I listened anyway and gave them my respect.

The thing is, I never thought I could do the same.

That's not to say I am the most articulate person in the world right now. I'm not. I just didn't think my brain had the capacity to do that. I was a smart kid in school, but being good at taking tests is a much different skill than stringing together coherent thoughts about big problems and articulating them to someone else.

I felt like I had to memorize entire books' worth of information so that I could recite it on the spot, because I was trained to learn that way.

But now, over a decade later, and without really trying to become articulate... my job, as a writer and self-proclaimed internet micro celebrity, is to arti

# Death of Software. Nah.

(Description: A wide, dynamic image of turbulent water with splashing waves and light blue-white bokeh orbs floating across the frame, evoking flow, movement, and transformation.)

Too much of what is going on is a race to get to a theoretical end state of a whole new world of business and technology. Many pushing this were around for the tail end of the transition to an internet-based economy and are struggling with what appears to be a "compressed timeline," much the way people record disruption as a "moment" versus a journey.

I've been thinking about where we are today with AI and the transition to this next wave, generation, platform of computing, and how it might look like previous transitions but really isn't. I'm thinking about three different transitions: the transition to the PC and graphical interface, the shift to online retail, and the pivot to streaming.

**AI changes what we build and who builds it, but not how much needs to be built. We need vastly more software, not less.**

## PC and Graphical Interface

The paradigm shift to the PC and graphical interface is a wild one when looked at in context. The most important thing about the PC is that the first predictions were *de minimis*, followed by the prediction that it would eliminate mainframe computing and the data center. HAHA. Everyone was wrong all around.

First, the run up to the internet saw the installed base of PCs go from under 100M to nearly 1B. PC growth was insane. But i

# The Math Needed for AI/ML (Complete Roadmap)

(Description: Header image with a surreal, cyberpunk aesthetic featuring three Renaissance-style portrait busts with neon green faces, wearing ornate period clothing. The busts are positioned around vintage computer monitors and connected by a web of lines and colored nodes in blue, purple, and green. Scattered code snippets visible in the upper left corner, including lines with "MATTE.IN" and class definitions. The composition blends classical art with modern technology symbolism.)

In this article, I'm going to break down the essential math you need for AI and machine learning. I'll also share the exact roadmap and resources that helped me personally. Let's get straight to it.

## 1. Statistics and Probability

*The language of uncertainty, data, and inference*

AI/ML systems learn from data that is noisy, incomplete, and uncertain. Probability and statistics provide the formal tools to reason under uncertainty and to extract reliable patterns from samples.

### 1.1 Populations and Sampling

- **Population**: The full set of possible data points (usually unobservable).
- **Sample**: A subset drawn from the population.
- Understanding sampling bias, representativeness, and variance is crucial for model generalization.

### 1.2 Descriptive Statistics

- **Mean, Median, Mode**: Measures of central tendency.
- **Expected Value**: The probabilistic average; foundational for loss functions and risk minimization.

### 1.3 Variance an

# Prompt Engineering 501: Thinking Critically

(Description: An isometric illustration featuring a mechanical/industrial aesthetic. The image shows a central platform with gears, cogs, and mechanical components in blue and cream tones. Surrounding elements include architectural structures with stairs, wheels, and various mechanical parts arranged in an abstract three-dimensional landscape, representing the concept of systematic thinking and mechanical problem-solving.)

I've been doing a lot of prompt engineering lately and have been looking for ways to improve my prompts. One approach I took was the skill **sharpen-output**.

**sharpen-output** is an agent skill that takes as input one of your prompts and iteratively asks you questions in order to make it better. Then, it outputs the improved prompt. Pretty cool, no?

You can try it yourselves with [skills.sh](https://skills.sh):
```bash
$ npx skills add jbrukh/skills --skill sharpen-output
```

## The think-critically Skill

However, I went down a real rabbit hole when I invented **think-critically**. This is an adversarial analysis prompt which accepts:

- a prompt;
- an expectation of the result or output the prompt should produce, either inferred from context or specified directly by the user.

It then outputs an analysis of whether the prompt is likely to actually get the result the user is intending. It seemed to work pretty well, surfacing issues and having some real insights into how LLMs process prompts.

# memsync
Type: concept
First seen: Phase 1 (memory pipeline)
Status: stale

## What it is
The memory synchronization daemon concept — intended to sync agent memory state across the constellation. Referenced as `memsync_daemon.py` in MEMORY.md but the file does NOT exist at the documented path (`orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/memsync_daemon.py`).

## Relationships
- referenced_by: 12 files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, intention compass, memory architecture, deferred commitments, multiple prompts)
- conceptual_part_of: Memory pipeline (Phase 1)
- missing_implementation: `memsync_daemon.py` not found

## Current state
BROKEN. The daemon file does not exist despite being documented in MEMORY.md and CLAUDE.md. The concept is referenced in 12 files across the knowledge graph but has no running implementation. This is a known gap — memory pipeline Phase 1 was declared COMPLETE but memsync hardening (DC-114/115) remains P1.

I hate to tease, but the plan is to share these to the newsletter first

(Description: Image displayed with text "Join over 50,000 Developers Becoming AI Heroes" with profile image and newsletter branding for AI Hero Newsletter by Matt Pocock)

It has been super good so far, and I'm trying it out as my new default.

---

Archive it immediately.

The code is the final proof of what's been done, as are the tests.
