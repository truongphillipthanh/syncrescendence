## Description (no transcript available)

What happens when the universe throws a random curveball at one of the most precise communities on Earth? Cosmic rays high-energy particles from deep space are invisible, unpredictable, and capable of interfering with electronics in ways gamers never expect.

Hannah Fry and Michael Stevens explore a surprising story from the speedrunning community, where split-second timings and frame-perfect precision collide with the chaos of the cosmos. How did a tiny particle from a distant supernova end up altering a world record attempt? And why does this single event highlight the hidden role of chance, physics, and electronics in competitive gaming?

From the science of cosmic rays to their real-world impact on gaming hardware, this episode uncovers the strange intersection of the cosmos, human skill, and digital records, revealing how even the universe can play a part in our most meticulously measured achievements.

Join Professor Hannah Fry and YouTube educator Michael Stevens as they uncover the strange, revealing story of the human tear: why we cry, what our tears communicate, and how this uniquely human response shapes the way we connect.
