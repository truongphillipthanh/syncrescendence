# The Shorthand Guide to Everything Claude Code

Here's my complete setup after 10 months of daily use: skills, hooks, subagents, MCPs, plugins, and what actually works.

## Background

Been an avid Claude Code user since the experimental rollout in Feb, and won the Anthropic x Forum Ventures hackathon with [Zenith](https://zenith.chat) alongside [@DRodriguezFX](https://x.com/@DRodriguezFX) completely using Claude Code.

(Description: Image showing "ANTHROPIC HACKATHON WINNER TIPS & TRICKS FOR CLAUDE CODE" with Claude Code v2.1.11 configuration details and Opus 4.5 + Claude API information displayed against a light blue background with an orange/red pixel art mascot icon on the left)

In September 2025, took the W at the @AnthropicAI x @forumventures hackathon in NYC. Thanks for hosting and for the 15k in Anthropic Credits. @DRodriguezFX and I built PMFProbe to take founders from 0 -> 1, validate your idea at the pre MVP stage.

## Skills and Commands

Skills operate like rules, constricted to certain scopes and workflows. They're shorthand to prompts when you need to execute a particular workflow.

After a long session of coding with Opus 4.5, you want to clean out dead code and loose .md files? Run `/refactor-clean`. Need testing? `/tdd`, `/e2e`, `/test-coverage`. Skills and commands can be chained together in a single prompt.

(Description: Terminal screenshot showing Claude Code interface with custom commands chained together. Display shows context management with "Context left until auto-compact: 0%" and various permission bypass options visible)

I can make a skill that updates codemaps at checkpoints - a way for Claude to quickly navigate your codebase without burning context on exploration.
```
~/.claude/skills/codemap-updater.md
```

Commands are skills executed via slash commands. They overlap but are stored differently:

- **Skills:** `~/.claude/skills` - broader workflow definitions
- **Commands:** `~/.claude/commands` - quick executable prompts
```bash
# Example skill structure
~/.claude/skills/
  pmx-guidelines.md            # Project-specific patterns
  coding-standards.md          # Language best practices
  tdd-workflow/                # Multi-file skill with README.md
  security-review/             # Checklist-based skill
```

## Hooks

Hooks are trigger-based automations that fire on specific events. Unlike skills, they're constricted to tool calls and lifecycle events.

### Hook Types

1. **PreToolUse** - Before a tool executes (validation, reminders)
2. **PostToolUse** - After a tool finishes (formatting, feedback loops)
3. **UserPromptSubmit** - When you send a message
4. **Stop** - When Claude finishes responding
5. **PreCompact** - Before context compaction
6. **Notification** - Permission requests

### Example: tmux reminder before long-running commands
```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "tool == \\"Bash\\" && tool_input.command matches \\"(npm|pnpm|yarn|cargo|pytest)\\"",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "if [ -z \\"$TMUX\\" ]; then echo '[Hook] Consider tmux for session persistence' >&2; fi"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

(Description: Terminal screenshot showing Claude Code executing a hook with output displaying "Read(.claude/hooks/stop-hook.sh)" and "Read 26 lines" with "Running PostToolUse hook..." status message)

**Pro tip:** Use the `hookify` plugin to create hooks conversationally instead of writing JSON manually. Run `/hookify` and describe what you want.

## Subagents

Subagents are processes your orchestrator (main Claude) can delegate tasks to with limited scopes. They can run in background or foreground, freeing up context for the main agent.

Subagents work nicely with skills - a subagent capable of executing a subset of your skills can be delegated tasks and use those skills autonomously. They can also be sandboxed with specific tool permissions.
```bash
# Example subagent structure
~/.claude/agents/
  planner.md                   # Feature implementation planning
  architect.md                 # System design decisions
  tdd-guide.md                 # Test-driven development
  code-reviewer.md             # Quality/security review
  security-reviewer.md         # Vulnerability analysis
  build-error-resolver.md
  e2e-runner.md
  refactor-cleaner.md
```

Configure allowed tools, MCPs, and permissions per subagent for proper scoping.

## Rules and Memory

Your `.rules` folder holds `.md` files with best practices Claude should ALWAYS follow. Two approaches:

1. **Single CLAUDE.md** - Everything in one file (user or project level)
2. **Rules folder** - Modular `.md` files grouped by concern
```bash
~/.claude/rules/
  security.md                  # No hardcoded secrets, validate inputs
  coding-style.md              # Immutability, file organization
  testing.md                   # TDD workflow, 80% coverage
  git-workflow.md              # Commit format, PR process
  agents.md                    # When to delegate to subagents
  performance.md               # Model selection, context management
```

### Example rules:

- No emojis in codebase
- Refrain from purple hues in frontend
- Always test code before deployment
- Prioritize modular code over mega-files
- Never commit console.logs

## MCPs (Model Context Protocol)

MCPs connect Claude to external services directly. Not a replacement for APIs - it's a prompt-driven wrapper around them, allowing more flexibility in navigating information.

**Example:** Supabase MCP lets Claude pull specific data, run SQL directly upstream without copy-paste. Same for databases, deployment platforms, etc.

(Description: Terminal screenshot showing Supabase MCP command output displaying "supabase - List tables (MCP)(schemas: ["public"])" with a "Cascading... (ctrl+c to interrupt · thinking)" message in salmon/coral text)

**Chrome in Claude:** is a built-in plugin MCP that lets Claude autonomously control your browser - clicking around to see how things work.

### CRITICAL: Context Window Management

Be picky with MCPs. I keep all MCPs in user config but **disable everything unused**. Navigate to `/plugins` and scroll down or run `/mcp`.

Your 200k context window before compacting might only be 70k with too many tools enabled. Performance degrades significantly.

(Description: Claude Code plugin interface showing the "/plugin" tab with "Discover", "Installed", and "Marketplaces" sections. Various plugins are listed with status indicators including "needs auth", "connected", and "disabled" states)

**Rule of thumb:** Have 20-30 MCPs in config, but keep under 10 enabled / under 80 tools active.

## Plugins

Plugins package tools for easy installation instead of tedious manual setup. A plugin can be a skill + MCP combined, or hooks/tools bundled together.

### Installing plugins:
```bash
# Add a marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/mixedbread-ai/mgrep

# Open Claude, run /plugins, find new marketplace, install from there
```

(Description: Claude Code plugin marketplace interface showing three available marketplaces: "claude-code-plugins" (13 available, 8 installed), "claude-plugins-official" (46 available, 5 installed), and "Mixedbread-Grep" (1 available, 1 installed) with installation metadata and update dates)

### LSP Plugins:

are particularly useful if you run Claude Code outside editors frequently. Language Server Protocol gives Claude real-time type checking, go-to-definition, and intelligent completions without needing an IDE open.
```bash
# Enabled plugins example
typescript-lsp@claude-plugins-official      # TypeScript intelligence
pyright-lsp@claude-plugins-official         # Python type checking
hookify@claude-plugins-official             # Create hooks conversationally
mgrep@Mixedbread-Grep                       # Better search than ripgrep
```

Same warning as MCPs - watch your context window.

## Tips and Tricks

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+U** - Delete entire line (faster than backspace spam)
- **!** - Quick bash command prefix
- **@** - Search for files
- **/** - Initiate slash commands
- **Shift+Enter** - Multi-line input
- **Tab** - Toggle thinking display
- **Esc Esc** - Interrupt Claude / restore code

### Parallel Workflows

**`/fork`** - Fork conversations to do non-overlapping tasks in parallel instead of spamming queued messages

**Git Worktrees** - For overlapping parallel Claudes without conflicts. Each worktree is an independent checkout
```bash
git worktree add ../feature-branch feature-branch
# Now run separate Claude instances in each worktree
```

### tmux for Long-Running Commands:

Stream and watch logs/bash processes Claude runs.

(Description: Terminal screenshot showing tmux session management. Displays tmux tabs showing "Viewing logs with tmux X1", "...Documents/GitHub...", "X2", etc. with session information and command output. Shows "To view logs" section with "Frontend logs" and "Backend logs" directions, tmux shortcuts, and "Brewed for 3m 27s" timing. Includes user prompt with context percentage)
```bash
tmux new -s dev
# Claude runs commands here, you can detach and reattach
tmux attach -t dev
```

### mgrep > grep:

`mgrep` is a significant improvement from ripgrep/grep. Install via plugin marketplace, then use the `/mgrep` skill. Works with both local search and web search.
```bash
mgrep "function handleSubmit"           # Local search
mgrep --web "Next.js 15 app router changes"  # Web search
```

### Other Useful Commands

- **`/rewind`** - Go back to a previous state
- **`/statusline`** - Customize with branch, context %, todos
- **`/checkpoints`** - File-level undo points
- **`/compact`** - Manually trigger context compaction

### GitHub Actions CI/CD

Set up code review on your PRs with GitHub Actions. Claude can review PRs automatically when configured.

(Description: GitHub interface showing a code review comment from @claude on Nov 19, 2025. The review shows "Code Review: ANT-265 - Image Aspect Ratio Fix" with "✅ Approval: LGTM with minor observations" status and explanatory text about the bug fix)

### Sandboxing

Use sandbox mode for risky operations - Claude runs in restricted environment without affecting your actual system. (Use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to do the opposite of this and let claude roam free, this can be destructive if not careful.)

## On Editors

While an editor isn't needed it can positively or negatively impact your Claude Code workflow. While Claude Code works from any terminal, pairing it with a capable editor unlocks real-time file tracking, quick navigation, and integrated command execution.

### Zed (My Preference)

I use [Zed](https://zed.dev) - a Rust-based editor that's lightweight, fast, and highly customizable.

**Why Zed works well with Claude Code:**

- **Agent Panel Integration** - Zed's Claude integration lets you track file changes in real-time as Claude edits. Jump between files Claude references without leaving the editor
- **Performance** - Written in Rust, opens instantly and handles large codebases without lag
- **CMD+Shift+R Command Palette** - Quick access to all your custom slash commands, debuggers, and tools in a searchable UI. Even if you just want to run a quick command without switching to terminal
- **Minimal Resource Usage** - Won't compete with Claude for system resources during heavy operations
- **Vim Mode** - Full vim keybindings if that's your thing

(Description: Zed editor screenshot showing a split-view workspace. Left side shows a file tree structure with project files and folders highlighted. Right side displays code editor with syntax highlighting and a dropdown menu showing "Zed (GUI Preferences)", "highlighted as per git diffs", "agent: Panel integration for real-time...", "Performance: benefits Rust-based...", and "VB Code - brief mention with useful extensions..." The bottom right corner shows a bullseye icon for "Following mode")

**Following mode shown as the bullseye in the bottom right.**

#### Zed-specific tips:

1. **Split your screen** - Terminal with Claude Code on one side, editor on the other using
2. **Ctrl + G** - quickly open the file Claude is currently working on in Zed
3. **Auto-save** - Enable autosave so Claude's file reads are always current
4. **Git integration** - Use editor's git features to review Claude's changes before committing
5. **File watchers** - Most editors auto-reload changed files, verify this is enabled

### VSCode / Cursor

This is also a viable choice and works well with Claude Code. You can use it in either terminal format, with automatic sync with your editor using `\\ide` enabling LSP functionality (somewhat redundant with plugins now). Or you can opt for the extension which is more integrated with the Editor and has a matching UI.

(Description: Visual display showing VSCode interface with Claude Code integration. Shows file tree, code editor with syntax highlighting, and Claude Code panel. Contains text "from the docs directly at https://code.claude.com/docs/en/vs-code")

(Description: VSCode extension documentation screenshot showing IDE interface with file explorer, code editor, terminal output showing test results and "Parsing..." status, with green progress bars and logging information)

**The VS Code extension provides a native graphical interface for Claude Code, integrated directly into your IDE. This is the recommended way to use Claude Code in VS Code.**

With the extension, you can review and edit Claude's plans before accepting them, auto-accept edits as they're made, @-mention files with specific line ranges from your selection, access conversation history, and open multiple conversations in separate tabs or windows.

  },
  "magic": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@magicuidesign/mcp@latest"]
  }
}
```

**Disabled per project (context window management):**
```markdown
# In ~/.claude.json under projects.[path].disabledMcpServers
disabledMcpServers: [
  "playwright",
  "cloudflare-workers-builds",
  "cloudflare-workers-bindings",
  "cloudflare-observability",
  "cloudflare-docs",
  "clickhouse",
  "AbletonMCP",
  "context7",
  "magic"
]
```

**This is the key - I have 14 MCPs configured but only ~ 5-6 enabled per project. Keeps context window healthy.**

### Key Hooks
```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [
    // tmux reminder for long-running commands
    {
      "matcher": "npm|pnpm|yarn|cargo|pytest",
      "hooks": ["tmux reminder"]
    },
    // Block unnecessary .md file creation
    {
      "matcher": "Write && .md file",
      "hooks": ["block unless README/CLAUDE"]
    },
    // Review before git push
    {
      "matcher": "git push",
      "hooks": ["open editor for review"]
    }
  ],
  "PostToolUse": [
    // Auto-format JS/TS with Prettier
    {
      "matcher": "Edit && .ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx",
      "hooks": ["prettier --write"]
    },
    // TypeScript check after edits
    {
      "matcher": "Edit && .ts/.tsx",
      "hooks": ["tsc --noEmit"]
    },
    // Warn about console.log
    {
      "matcher": "Edit",
      "hooks": ["grep console.log warning"]
    }
  ],
  "Stop": [
    // Audit for console.logs before session ends
    {
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": ["check modified files for console.log"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Custom Status Line

Shows user, directory, git branch with dirty indicator, context remaining %, model, time, and todo count:

(Description: Terminal status line screenshot showing "affoon:~ ctx:65% Opus 4.5 19:52" with "plan mode on (shift+tab to cycle)" indicator below it)

**example statusline in my Mac root directory**

### Rules Structure
```markdown
~/.claude/rules/
  security.md                  # Mandatory security checks
  coding-style.md              # Immutability, file size limits
  testing.md                   # TDD, 80% coverage
  git-workflow.md              # Conventional commits
  agents.md                    # Subagent delegation rules
  patterns.md                  # API response formats
  performance.md               # Model selection (Haiku vs Sonnet vs Opus)
  hooks.md                     # Hook documentation
```

### Subagents
```markdown
~/.claude/agents/
  planner.md                   # Break down features
  architect.md                 # System design
  tdd-guide.md                 # Write tests first
  code-reviewer.md             # Quality review
  security-reviewer.md         # Vulnerability scan
  build-error-resolver.md
  e2e-runner.md                # Playwright tests
  refactor-cleaner.md          # Dead code removal
  doc-updater.md               # Keep docs synced
```

## Key Takeaways

1. Don't overcomplicate - treat configuration like fine-tuning, not architecture
2. Context window is precious - disable unused MCPs and plugins
3. Parallel execution - fork conversations, use git worktrees
4. Automate the repetitive - hooks for formatting, linting, reminders
5. Scope your subagents - limited tools = focused execution
