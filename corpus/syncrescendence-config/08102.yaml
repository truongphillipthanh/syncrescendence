reasoning_modes:
  default: Standard
  deep_reasoning: Big Brain, Think
  how_to_invoke: 
    - Big Brain: Prefix with "Use Big Brain mode to..." for complex problems
    - Think: Activate via UI "think button" or prefix "Use Think mode to..." for step-by-step reasoning

routing_semantics:
  auto_routing: false
  triggers: 
    - "complex", "in-depth", "analyze deeply" → Big Brain
    - "step-by-step", "break down" → Think
    - "search", "real-time" → DeepSearch with x_semantic_search or web_search

token_limits:
  input: 1,000,000
  output: 8,192
  safe_margin: 10%

formatting_capabilities:
  json_mode: true, supports structured outputs with explicit "output in JSON" directive
  markdown_fidelity: High, handles headers, lists, tables, code blocks cleanly
  tables: Good, prefers markdown tables; ensure clear column/row intent in prompt

tool_use:
  functions_or_tools: Yes, supports code_execution, web_search, x_semantic_search
  retrieval_or_browse: Yes, bind via "DeepSearch [query]", "use X search for [term]", or "execute code [snippet]"

safety_and_style:
  refusal_style: Terse, e.g., "I cannot assist with that request due to safety constraints."
  over-verbosity_risk: Medium, mitigate by specifying "concise" or "brief" in prompt
  hallucination_triggers: Creative/narrative tasks without grounding; counter with "use provided context only" or DeepSearch

style_adapters:
  rhetoric_preservation: Maintains user cadence via Style Shield, no chain-of-thought leakage; literalism requires explicit directives
  idiom_sensitivity: Low, dials down cultural idioms unless prompted; prefers neutral, erudite tone

temporal_checks:
  how_to_verify_freshness: Uses web_search or x_semantic_search for time-sensitive claims when "verify recency" or "real-time" is specified

notes:
  other_idiosyncrasies: 
    - Excels in planning, coding architecture, unbiased research; literalism requires explicit steps
    - Coherence dips in extended/multimodal tasks; mitigate via iterative refinement or concise queries
    - Multimodal (image) regressions; favor text-heavy tasks
    - Unfiltered truth-seeking with jailbreak resistance; prefers user-driven clarity
