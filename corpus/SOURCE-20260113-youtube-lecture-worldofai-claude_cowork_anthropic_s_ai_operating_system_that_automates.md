## Description (no transcript available)

Anthropic just launched Claude Cowork, a brand-new agentic AI that turns Claude into an autonomous virtual teammate — not just a chatbot.

Cowork is basically Claude Code for non-technical users. It can work directly inside your files, plan multi-step tasks, and automate real desktop workflows using nothing but natural language.

In this video, we break down:
What Claude Cowork actually is
How it automates everyday desktop work
Why this feels like the world’s first AI operating system
Real demos: organizing folders, extracting data from screenshots, summarizing hundreds of documents, and even running tools like FFmpeg with plain English
Who gets access (macOS only… for now 👀)

Cowork runs on the same agent SDK as Claude Code, but with a simplified UI built for everyday users. You give it access to a folder, describe what you want done, and Claude plans, executes, and checks in before taking major actions.

This is a major step toward agentic AI that actually does work — not just talks about it.

⚠️ Currently available in research preview on macOS for Claude Max subscribers, with waitlist access for others.
