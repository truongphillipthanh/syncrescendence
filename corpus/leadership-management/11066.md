## What is Voicebox?
Voicebox is a **local-first voice cloning studio** with DAW-like features for professional voice synthesis. Think of it as a **local, free and open-source alternative to ElevenLabs** — download models, clone voices, and generate speech entirely on your machine.
Unlike cloud services that lock your voice data behind subscriptions, Voicebox gives you complete privacy, professional tools, and native performance. Download a voice model, clone any voice from a few seconds of audio, and compose multi-voice projects with studio-grade editing tools.
Optimized for performance with **Metal acceleration on Mac** and **CUDA acceleration on Windows/Linux** for fast, local inference.
**No Python install required.**
