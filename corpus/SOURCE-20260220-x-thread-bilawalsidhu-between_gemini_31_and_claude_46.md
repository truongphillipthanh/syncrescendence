# Bilawal Sidhu X Thread: Spatial Intelligence & Geospatial AI
Between Gemini 3.1 and Claude 4.6 it's honestly wild what you can build. This feels like Google Earth and Palantir had a baby.
Made this with all the geospatial bells and whistles -- real time plane & satellite tracking, real traffic cams in Austin, and even got a traffic system working. Panoptic detection on everything.
Skinned the whole thing to look like a classified intelligence system. EO, FLIR, CRT. Got a bunch more stuff on the roadmap. This is fun.

Left sidebar shows options for "Live Flights," "Earthquakes," "Satellites," "Street Traffic," "Weather Radar," and "CCTV Mesh." The main view shows a spherical 3D projection of Earth with real-time tracking overlays. Right sidebar displays tactical controls, sensor readings, and visualization modes including EO, FLIR, CRT, and Panoptic detection toggles. Bottom displays playback controls and mission timeline.)

Lmao. When the palantir co-founder responds to your vibe coded project on TBPN:
(Description: Quoted tweet from TBPN (@tbpn) from 21 hours ago stating "Could you actually vibe code Palantir? Co-founder @JTLonsdale says if you're building low-end SaaS, you're in trouble. But if you're spending $100M+ to build software, no one is replacing that:..." with "Show more" link. Embedded video thumbnail showing TBPN live episode with three panelists at timestamp 12:57. Video caption reads "YEAH I VIBE CODED YOUR FORMER" with text "BASIC THAT YOU CAN KIND OF" visible. Bottom overlay shows "JORDI HAYS @JORDIHAYST | JOHN COOGAN @JOHNCOOGAN | JOE LONSDALE LIVE ON TBPN | GENERAL PARTNER, BVC | @JTLONSDALE" with timestamp 0:37/1:36.)

It really should - why spend endless hours of meetings and product review when you can just build the damn thing in 2 hours
