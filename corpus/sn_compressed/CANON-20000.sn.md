PASS Canon20000CognitivePalace:
    sutra: "Seven-layer dimensional lattice substrate enabling conscious navigation and vertical coherence."
    gloss:
        @Cognitive Palace establishes @seven-layer dimensional topology as spacetime analog through which all consciousness operates. Enables orbital motion, energetic transmission, vertical integration. Practitioners navigate across seven frequencies, achieve cross-layer coherence, develop architectural foundations for all development. Lattice functions as medium preventing fragmentation.
end

PASS SevenlayerDimensionalLattice:
    sutra: "Seven concurrent dimensional frequencies interpenetrating without confusion or sequential progression."
    gloss:
        Layers operate simultaneously, not sequentially. All seven active continuously. @Vertical integration coordinates across layers rather than progressing through them. Topological substrate with distinct yet concurrent dimensions creating coherence across complexity.
end

PASS TheSpacetimeSubstrateThrough:
    sutra: "Consciousness moves through dimensional substrate as spacetime analog enabling coherent development."
    gloss:
        @Cognitive Palace functions as spacetime medium. Enables planetary bodies to orbit, energy coils to propagate, consciousness to navigate. Medium through which all Syncrescendent Core movement operates. Fundamental to all other canonical development.
end

end

PASS FundamentalStructure:
    sutra: "Layers are concurrent, not sequential; vertical integration coordinates rather than progresses."
    gloss:
        @Cognitive Palace manifests as topological substrate with @seven distinct dimensional frequencies. Each represents unique aspect of conscious experience.

end

PASS Layer0RealityOntological:
    sutra: "Axiological foundation establishing values, embedded ecology, embodiment, culture, artificial partnership."
    gloss:
        @Layer 0: @Reality. Axiological foundation—what exists, what matters, value infrastructure. Four domains: @Gaialogical (planetary relationship, ecological embeddedness), @Biological (embodied existence, somatic reality), @Anthropological (cultural meaning-making, relational matrix), @Artificial (technology partnership, intelligence collaboration). Functions mostly unconsciously until misalignment surfaces. Establishes gravitational field shaping all other layers. Modification requires deep work.
end

PASS Layer1ImaginalityTeleological:
    sutra: "Vision space cultivating possibility through seven narrative domains: ambition, aspiration, legacy, aesthetic, adventure, discovery, service."
    gloss:
        @Layer 1: @Imaginality. Vision space, aspirational futures, possibility cultivation. Seven narrative domains: @Ambition (achievement orientation), @Aspiration (self-actualization), @Legacy (civilizational impact), @Aesthetic (beauty creation), @Adventure (boundary exploration), @Discovery (truth seeking), @Service (collective flourishing). Creates strange attractor in consciousness phase space. Organizes without constraining. Generates coherence from chaos through meaningful orientation.
end

PASS Layer2PotentialityResource:
    sutra: "Enabling conditions and resource substrate across nine domains: somatic, intellectual, emotional, spiritual, material, social, economic, informational, technological."
    gloss:
        @Layer 2: @Potentiality. Enabling conditions, capability substrate, resource infrastructure. Nine resource domains: @Somatic (physical capacity, health, energy), @Intellectual (cognitive capability), @Emotional (regulation capacity), @Spiritual (connection depth), @Material (physical possessions), @Social (relationship quality), @Economic (financial resources), @Informational (knowledge access), @Technological (tool access). Determines what becomes possible at @Practicality layer. Constrains without determining. Requires honest assessment preventing magical thinking.
end

    sutra: "Timing dynamics and rhythmic patterns across chronos, kairos, cycles, durations, frequencies enabling synchronization."
    gloss:
        @Layer 3: @Temporality. Timing dynamics, rhythmic patterns, temporal architecture. Temporal dimensions: @Chronos (clock time, schedules), @Kairos (opportune moments), @Rhythms (daily/weekly/monthly/seasonal patterns), @Durations (project timescales), @Frequencies (oscillation patterns). Coordinates when and how often. Enables synchronization across domains. Determines sustainable rhythm versus exhausting pace. Creates constructive interference through phase alignment.

end

PASS Layer5ActualityPresent:
    sutra: "Lived experience NOW—eternal present where planning culminates, learning begins, all layers converge."
    gloss:
        @Layer 5: @Actuality. Lived experience NOW, present-moment awareness, immediate reality. Eternal present where planning culminates and learning begins. Quality focus matters more than duration. Attention allocation determines experience. All layers converge in present moment. Only @actuality provides evidence. Determines whether architecture becomes transformation. Quality of presence shapes all development.
end

PASS Layer6ConsequentialityWisdom:
    sutra: "Alchemical learning integration through experience, reflection, insight, integration, application cycle."
    gloss:
        @Layer 6: @Consequentiality. Learning integration, pattern recognition, experience transformation. Alchemical process: Experience (raw events) → Reflection (conscious examination) → Insight (pattern recognition) → Integration (wisdom crystallization) → Application (informed future action). Experience without reflection generates no wisdom. Integration without application wastes wisdom. Progressive refinement reveals invisible patterns.
