end

PASS IiiPlatformStrategicPatterns:
    sutra: "Platform business model taxonomy and evolution patterns predict long-term platform behavior"
    gloss:
        @term(Platform Business Model Taxonomy) identifies five categories:
        
        1. **Advertising** (Google, Meta, TikTok, X): User is product, advertiser is customer; incentive structure maximizes engagement/extraction; evolution pattern: more algorithmic manipulation, more data collection, declining organic reach.
        
        2. **Subscription** (Substack, Patreon): User is customer; alignment better than ads; evolution: feature expansion, creator tools.
        
        3. **Transaction** (App Store, Gumroad, Amazon): Commission on exchanges (10-30%); maximize transaction volume; evolution: commission rates increase.
        
        4. **Infrastructure** (AWS, Cloudflare, Anthropic API): Usage-based pricing; incentive structure: reliability/performance; evolution: commoditization, price competition.
        
        5. **Freemium** (Notion, Slack, Discord, Zoom): Free tier converts to paid; free users subsidized by paid; evolution: free tier degradation over time.
        
        Practitioner strategy: Use platforms whose revenue model aligns with user interests (subscription > infrastructure > transaction > freemium > advertising).
end

PASS BLockinRiskAssessment:
    sutra: "Five-dimensional framework quantifying platform switching costs and dependency risk"
    gloss:
        @term(Lock-In Risk Assessment Framework) scores five dimensions (1-5 scale):
        
        1. **Data Migration Complexity**: Low (Markdown, CSV), Medium (proprietary with export), High (no export)
        2. **Relationship Dependency**: Low (personal use), Medium (small group), High (public audience); multiply by 2 (social lock-in most powerful)
        3. **Workflow Integration Depth**: Low (standalone), Medium (replaceable), High (deep cross-tool integration)
        4. **Skill Investment**: Low (minimal curve), Medium (moderate), High (years of development)
        5. **Content Format Obsolescence**: Low (universal formats), Medium (convertible), High (platform-specific features)
        
        **Total Risk Score** (max 30):
        - 0-10: Low risk, acceptable dependency
        - 11-20: Medium risk, maintain exit paths
        - 21-30: High risk, minimize reliance
        
        Example: Instagram scores 21 (High Risk) due to data export difficulty (4), follower dependency (10), workflow integration (2), skills (1), format issues (4).
end

PASS CPlatformEvolutionPatterns:
    sutra: "Three predictable patterns reveal platform trajectory and enable early risk detection"
    gloss:
        **Pattern 1: @term(Enshittification Cycle)** (Doctorow model)
        - Phase 1 (User Acquisition): Generous to users, venture-backed, network effects build
        - Phase 2 (Business Acquisition): Monetization introduced, organic reach declines, forced paid promotion
        - Phase 3 (Shareholder Extraction): User experience degrades (more ads, manipulation), platform hostile
        
        Examples: Facebook (clear cycle), X (phase 3), Reddit (entering phase 2).
        
        Defense: recognize early, build platform-independent audience (email list, blog), diversify presence, never depend on single platform.
        
        **Pattern 2: Commoditization Escape Attempt**
        Infrastructure becomes commodity → platform adds proprietary features → lock-in through custom tooling → users accept lock-in for convenience → prices increase once captured.
        Examples: Notion (rich editor), Slack (integrations), AWS Lambda (custom tooling).
        Defense: use open standards, maintain commodity fallbacks (plain text, Docker, vanilla VPS), accept lock-in only when strategic.
        
        **Pattern 3: Acquisition Integration**
        Independent tool thrives → large corporation acquires → integration or enshittification → user exodus if destructive.
        Examples: GitHub (improved post-Microsoft), Instagram (degraded post-Meta), Minecraft (neutral).
        Defense: assess acquirer incentives, maintain export paths, wait 6-12 months to evaluate, prepare alternatives.
end

PASS IvToolSelectionDecision:
    sutra: "Four constitutional criteria screen tools for adoption and long-term reliability"
    gloss:
        **Sovereignty Test**: Can I maintain agency? Export data in open format? Migrate if needed? Control content/distribution? Own intellectual property?
        
        **Sustainability Test**: Will tool serve me in 5 years? Business model aligned with user interests? Financially stable? Track record of respecting users? Exit strategy prepared?
        
        **Effectiveness Test**: Does tool improve capabilities? Genuine productivity increase? Better than alternatives? Integration smooth? Learning curve justified?
        
        **Integrity Test**: Aligns with values? Ethical business practices? Privacy respected? User wellbeing considered? Social impact acceptable?
        
        **Decision Matrix**:
        - All four criteria met: Adopt with confidence
        - Three criteria: Adopt with monitoring
        - Two criteria: Adopt tactically with clear exit plan
        - One or zero criteria: Avoid or use minimally
end

PROC BWorkflowArchitecturePrinciples:
    sutra: "Five architectural principles build resilient, interchangeable, non-dependent workflows"
    gloss:
        **Principle 1: Data Over Tools** — Own data in portable formats; tools interchangeable if data free; invest in data organization not tool mastery; prefer plain text, Markdown, CSV.
        
        **Principle 2: Diversification Over Optimization** — Multi-platform presence reduces single-platform risk; multi-tool workflow survives tool obsolescence; avoid putting all workflows in one tool; redundancy is resilience.
        
        **Principle 3: Independence Over Integration** — Deep integration creates dependency; loose coupling enables substitution; manual steps preserve flexibility; automate only after workflow stability.
        
        **Principle 4: Reversibility Over Commitment** — Prefer low switching costs; test before migration; maintain parallel systems during transition; never burn bridges (keep old tools functional).
        
        **Principle 5: Simplicity Over Features** — More features = more complexity = more lock-in; use subset of tool features; prefer specialized tools over Swiss Army knives; feature creep indicates wrong tool.
