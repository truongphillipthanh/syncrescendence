PASS Canon31141FiveaccountArchitecture:
    sutra: "Exhaustive specifications for five Identity-Intelligence Complexes operationalizing Syncrescendent multi-account framework."
    gloss:
        Five IIC modalities aligned with developmental chains, each with distinct cognitive personality, teleological output, operational architecture, platform grammar, curation philosophy, and integration handoffs. Acumen (Information) → Coherence (Insight) → Efficacy (Expertise) → Mastery (Knowledge) → Transcendence (Wisdom) synthesis cascade. Total constellation requires 35-50 hours weekly; sequential 36-month activation protocol; quality assurance and maintenance rhythms specified.
end

PASS ComprehensiveIicSpecificationsAcumen:
    sutra: "Five IIC specifications: Acumen IIC (Strategic Reconnaissance Intelligence), Coherence IIC (Meta-Analytical Synthesizer), Efficacy IIC (Mission-Driven Executor), Mastery IIC (Pedagogical Architect), Transcendence IIC (Meta-Cognitive Orchestrator)."
    gloss:
        Each IIC specifies: cognitive personality, temporal orientation, guiding virtues, teleological thesis, operational architecture, content flow architecture, platform grammar specifications (YouTube, X, Substack, GitHub, AI assistants), feed curation philosophy, daily/weekly/monthly/annual rhythms, automation thresholds vs. human judgment domains, output specifications to other chains and public tiers. Each IIC produces distinct value: Acumen generates daily intelligence briefs; Coherence develops conceptual frameworks; Efficacy builds functional capabilities; Mastery creates teaching curricula; Transcendence provides meta-coordination and wisdom integration.
end

PASS ChainInformationPlanetaryAcumen:
    sutra: "Chain alignment: Five IICs distributed across five developmental chains with explicit functional compartmentalization and zero overlap."
    gloss:
        @term Acumen IIC aligned with Information Chain (sensing). @term Coherence IIC aligned with Insight Chain (sensemaking). @term Efficacy IIC aligned with Expertise Chain (skillbuilding). @term Mastery IIC aligned with Knowledge Chain (teaching). @term Transcendence IIC aligned with Wisdom Chain (being). Each modality handles distinct cognitive function, temporal orientation, content interaction mode. Integration through synthesis cascade: raw intelligence → frameworks → implementation → teaching → wisdom.
end

PASS PartIConstitutionalFoundation:
    sutra: "Core architectural principles, parent artifact relationship, prerequisites for implementation."
    gloss:
        Four reinforced principles: (1) Functional Compartmentalization—each IIC represents distinct intelligence modality with zero overlap in purpose. (2) Chain Alignment—each IIC maps to one of six developmental chains. (3) Platform Exhaustiveness—each IIC engages any platform through unique operational grammar. (4) Integration Through Synthesis—IICs feed each other through deliberate handoff protocols. Prerequisites: understand Seven-Layer Stack, establish foundational Syncrescendent practice, accept progressive implementation (one IIC per 6 months minimum), commit to maintenance discipline. Implementation timeline: Months 1-6 Acumen, 7-12 Coherence, 13-18 Efficacy, 19-24 Mastery, 25-36 Transcendence.
end

PASS APurposePositioning:
    sutra: "Five-Account Architecture provides exhaustive operational specifications complementing IIC Constellation Overview parent artifact."
    gloss:
        Exhaustive specifications delivered: complete cognitive personality specs per IIC, operational architectures and platform grammars for each account, teleological output specifications and integration handoffs, AI mediation thresholds and human judgment domains, feed curation philosophies and qualification criteria, automation configurations and maintenance protocols. Not theoretical—specifications represent operational intelligence systems refined through practice. Tactical implementation guidance integrated with architectural vision.
end

PASS BRelationshipToParent:
    sutra: "CANON-31141 provides tactical detail for CANON-31140 architectural principles; assumes familiarity with parent artifact, Seven-Layer Stack, and Syncrescendent fundamentals."
    gloss:
        [[CANON-31140-IIC-lunar-ACUMEN-planetary-INFORMATION]] establishes: architectural rationale for multi-account systems, five-modality framework with Guiding Virtues, high-level integration protocols, lifecycle management principles, mapping to canonical dimensions. CANON-31141 specifies: exhaustive operational details per IIC, platform-specific interaction protocols, content flow architectures and qualification systems, day-to-day maintenance rhythms, tactical feed curation guidance. Dependency: read parent first for conceptual foundation.
end

NORM CCoreArchitecturalPrinciples:
    sutra: "Functional compartmentalization, chain alignment, platform exhaustiveness, integration through synthesis mandated."
    gloss:
        (1) Functional Compartmentalization REQUIRED: Each IIC represents distinct intelligence modality with zero overlap in purpose. Different accounts handle different cognitive functions, temporal orientations, content interaction modes. (2) Chain Alignment REQUIRED: Acumen→Information, Coherence→Insight, Efficacy→Expertise, Mastery→Knowledge, Transcendence→Wisdom. (3) Platform Exhaustiveness PERMITTED: Each IIC engages any platform through unique operational grammar. What differs is filtering lens, interaction protocol, output destination. (4) Integration Through Synthesis MANDATED: IICs must feed each other through deliberate handoff protocols: Acumen→Coherence (Intelligence→Frameworks), Coherence→Efficacy (Frameworks→Implementation), Efficacy→Mastery (Capability→Teaching), Mastery→Transcendence (Expertise→Wisdom), Transcendence→Acumen (Purpose→Prioritization).
end

PASS DPrerequisitesForImplementation:
    sutra: "Foundational requirements before configuring any IIC: Seven-Layer Stack understanding, established Syncrescendent practice, progressive implementation commitment, maintenance discipline."
    gloss:
        (1) MUST understand Seven-Layer Stack ([[CANON-31130]]) before IIC activation. Each IIC implements all seven layers with intentional choices. Technology sovereignty principles, lock-in tolerances, exit strategies essential. (2) MUST establish foundational practice (Seven Pulses minimum). IICs amplify existing practice, not create it. Basic Syncrescendent rhythm operational, energy state awareness developed. (3) MUST accept progressive implementation. Start with ONE IIC (typically Acumen), achieve operational stability before adding complexity. Sequential activation over months, not simultaneous launch. (4) MUST commit to maintenance discipline. IICs require ongoing curation and refinement. Weekly synthesis sessions non-negotiable. Quarterly strategic reviews essential. Implementation Timeline: Month 1-6 Acumen only; Month 7-12 Add Coherence; Month 13-18 Add Efficacy; Month 19-24 Add Mastery; Month 25-36 Add Transcendence. Critical Principle: Each IIC MUST be producing value before activating next. Quality over speed; single well-functioning IIC beats five poorly-configured.
