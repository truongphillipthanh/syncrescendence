# Κ-31000: Information Chain (SN)

PASS InformationChainInformationOrbital:
    sutra: "Information Chain tracks perceptual sophistication through four progressive stages aligned with Acumen development."
    gloss:
        @Information Chain (CON) maps perception refinement from pattern detection toward embodied knowing. Generates refined perception as energy return to Syncrescendent Core. Orbital class: 🔗 Chain. Parent: CANON-00000. Child: CANON-31100-ACUMEN-planetary-INFORMATION.
end

PASS PerceptualDevelopmentThroughAcumen:
    sutra: "Perceptual development spirals from basic pattern recognition toward embodied knowing via Planetary Acumen."
    gloss:
        @Acumen (CON) cultivates atmospheric awareness through four progressive stages. Each stage advances perceptual capacity measurably, corresponding to consciousness evolution contribution.
end

PASS CelestialNavigation:
    sutra: "Information Chain siblings: Intelligence (CANON-30000), Insight (CANON-32000), Expertise (CANON-33000), Knowledge (CANON-34000), Wisdom (CANON-35000)."
    gloss:
        Parent: Syncrescendent Schema (CANON-00000). Information Chain positioned as perception substrate within causal sequence.
end

PASS Purpose:
    sutra: "Information Chain develops atmospheric awareness through four stages, generating refined perception for core consciousness evolution."
    gloss:
        Tracks perceptual sophistication development corresponding to Planetary Acumen. Advancement requires condition and capability evidence, not timeline pressure.
end

PASS FourstageTrajectory:
    sutra: "Four-stage trajectory: Pattern Recognition → Signal Extraction → Intuitive Discrimination → Embodied Knowing."
    gloss:
        Sequential progression from basic structure detection toward transparent, effortless, wisdom-informed perception. Each stage requires specific practices and advancement evidence before progression.
end

PASS Stage1PatternRecognition:
    sutra: "Stage 1 establishes basic structure detection, signal awareness, attention sovereignty, platform literacy."
    gloss:
        Key markers: identifies recurring patterns; detects signals; recognizes attention capture; navigates platforms competently. Practices: seven archaeological domains (Demographic, Psychological, Cultural, Historical, Technological, Political-Economic, Incentive); attention tracking; pattern documentation; signal-noise discrimination. Advancement evidence: improving pattern identification accuracy; signal detection improvement; attention sovereignty development; platform competence demonstration.
end

PASS Stage2SignalExtraction:
    sutra: "Stage 2 develops noise filtering, salience identification, strategic attention allocation, authentic platform presence."
    gloss:
        Key markers: distinguishes signal from noise consistently; identifies high-value sources; manages attention strategically; builds engaging platform presence. Practices: source quality curation; attention budgeting (deliberate focus allocation); platform cultivation; triadic perception integration (aesthetic/empirical/strategic). Advancement evidence: improving signal-to-noise ratio; accurate source assessment; rising engagement metrics; optimized attention allocation.
end

PASS Stage3IntuitiveDiscrimination:
    sutra: "Stage 3 activates pre-cognitive knowing, felt-sense accuracy, aesthetic intelligence, multi-modal integration, teaching capacity."
    gloss:
        Key markers: reliable intuitive signal detection (>70% accuracy verified); aesthetic intelligence operational; multi-modal perception integrated (visual/textual/social); teaches others successfully. Practices: intuition tracking (predictions vs. outcomes); aesthetic cultivation; cross-modal integration; teaching experiments. Advancement evidence: intuition accuracy >70%; aesthetic judgment aligns with expert consensus; teaching effectiveness demonstrated; multi-modal fluency.
end

PASS Stage4EmbodiedKnowing:
    sutra: "Stage 4 manifests transparent, automatic perception, novel signal recognition, wisdom integration, multigenerational teaching."
    gloss:
        Key markers: perception operates automatically without conscious effort; recognizes novel signals without prior training; wisdom-informed sensing; second-generation practitioners emerging. Practices: continuous presence cultivation; wisdom integration; advanced teaching; collective intelligence contribution. Advancement evidence: automatic competence across contexts; novel domain transfer; multigenerational teaching (students teach students); recognized perceptual authority.
end

PASS SynchronizationGuidance:
    sutra: "Maintain synchronization between Sensing stage and Technology, Coherence, Efficacy chains; avoid >2-stage imbalance."
    gloss:
        Imbalance indicators: Sensing >2 stages ahead of Embodiment = theoretical perception without grounding; >2 stages behind Coherence = signals without frameworks; >2 stages behind Efficacy = perception without strategic application. Healthy progression: Sensing advances with Technology (tools enable perception); Sensing slightly ahead of Coherence (detect before understanding); Sensing coordinated with Efficacy (perception informs strategy).
end

PROC MeasurementProtocol:
    sutra: "Monthly assessment and quarterly review measure honest stage placement and advancement criteria completion."
    gloss:
        Monthly assessment: (1) Identify current stage (evidence-based, not aspirational); (2) List specific advancement criteria met; (3) Identify practices serving current stage; (4) Verify synchronization with other chains. Quarterly review: evaluate stage progression; check cross-chain balance; assess practice effectiveness; verify advancement timeline realism.
end

PASS Conclusion:
    sutra: "Information Chain develops atmospheric awareness through four stages, with honest assessment enabling advancement."
    gloss:
        Perception spirals toward embodied knowing. Progress conditioned on capability and evidence, not timeline pressure. Current coordinates determine appropriate practice.
end

PASS Crossreferences:
    sutra: "Related canons: CANON-00005 (Core), CANON-00010 (Operations), CANON-00006 (Corpus), CANON-30000 (Intelligence substrate), CANON-32100 (Coherence cross-chain)."
    gloss:
        CANON-31100-ACUMEN-planetary-INFORMATION (child: Planetary Acumen). Feedcraft (CAP) and IIC (STR) support information chain operations.
