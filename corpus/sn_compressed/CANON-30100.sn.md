        @Resonance_Index Evaluation measures how naturally and transparently technology extends human capability without friction. It evaluates Learnability Resonance (ease of competence), Performance Resonance (support for expert levels), Cognitive Resonance (alignment with mental models), Emotional Resonance (user satisfaction/engagement), and Somatic Resonance (comfort, ergonomics).

PASS EvolutionPotentialAnalysis:
    sutra: "Evolution Potential Analysis assesses a system's readiness for future development, integration, and adaptation."
    gloss:
        Evolution Potential Analysis evaluates a system's capacity for future development, integration, and adaptation. It includes Upgrade Pathway Assessment (architectural flexibility, compatibility), Integration Readiness (interoperability, ecosystem potential), Adaptation Capability (customization, learning), Sustainability Evaluation (long-term viability), and Innovation Potential (breakthrough possibilities).

PASS XiEthicalGovernanceFramework:
    sutra: "The Ethical Governance Framework offers a structured approach to ethical oversight proportional to integration depth."
    gloss:
        The Ethical Governance Framework provides a structured approach to ethical oversight, scaling with integration depth and potential impact. It covers Foundational Ethical Principles, Gradient-Proportional Governance, and Risk Assessment and Mitigation.
end

NORM FoundationalEthicalPrinciples:
    sutra: "Core ethical principles guide symbiotic systems design: human agency, beneficence, justice, transparency, and dignity."
    gloss:
        Principle 1: Human Agency Preservation. Technology must enhance human autonomy and choice.
        Principle 2: Beneficence and Non-Maleficence. Systems must promote flourishing and minimize harm.
        Principle 3: Justice and Equity. Benefits and risks must be fairly distributed; reduce inequalities.
        Principle 4: Transparency and Accountability. Operations must be understandable, subject to oversight.
        Principle 5: Dignity and Respect. Systems must preserve human worth as ends, not means.
    enforcement: Adherence is mandatory for system integrity and societal acceptance; violations compromise ethical standing and operational legitimacy.
end

PASS GradientproportionalGovernance:
    sutra: "Gradient-Proportional Governance scales ethical oversight with symbiotic integration depth."
    gloss:
        Gradient-Proportional Governance scales ethical oversight with integration depth. Lower Gradient (G0-G3) focuses on basic safety/privacy via standards. Middle Gradient (G4-G7) emphasizes algorithmic accountability, well-being, proportionality, and user empowerment. Upper Gradient (G8-G11) requires comprehensive frameworks for cognitive sovereignty, existential safety, identity, and extensive regulatory oversight. Adaptive governance updates constantly.
end

PASS RiskAssessmentAndMitigation:
    sutra: "Risk Assessment and Mitigation systematically identifies, evaluates, and manages potential harms from symbiotic technologies."
    gloss:
        Risk Assessment and Mitigation identifies, evaluates, and manages potential harms (individual, social, existential) from symbiotic technologies. Categories include individual risks (physical safety, manipulation, privacy), social risks (inequality, democratic degradation), and existential risks (agency displacement, consciousness modification). Mitigation strategies involve prevention, detection, response, and recovery, with ongoing governance evolution.

PASS XiiPracticalImplementationFramework:
    sutra: "The Practical Implementation Framework translates ASA's theoretical foundations into actionable methodologies."
    gloss:
        The Practical Implementation Framework provides systematic methodologies for applying ASA to system analysis, design, and governance. It includes a Universal Classification Methodology, Design Optimization Guidelines, and Governance Implementation.
end

PASS UniversalClassificationMethodology:
    sutra: "The Universal Classification Methodology is a seven-step process for analyzing human-technology coupling using the ASA framework."
    gloss:
        The Universal Classification Methodology provides a seven-step process: (1) Constitutional Mapping, (2) Object Classification (per Object Ontology), (3) Dimensional Analysis (per Coupling Topology), (4) Gradient Positioning (per Evolutionary Gradient), (5) Contract Specification (per Capability Contracts), (6) Quality Assessment, and (7) Governance Design.
end

PROC DesignOptimizationGuidelines:
    sutra: "Design Optimization Guidelines outline approaches for creating coherent, resonant, and beneficial symbiotic architectures."
    gloss:
        Achieve high coherence, @resonance_index, and beneficial impact via:
        - Constitutional Design: Clean layer separation, optimized information flow, extensibility.
        - Dimensional Optimization: Align @agency_distribution, @embodiment_depth, @temporal_binding, @cognitive_architecture.
        - Platform Integration: Match (Platform Overlay Architecture) for context, customize, ensure compatibility.
        - Evolutionary Planning: Graceful progression through @Evolutionary_Gradient, backward compatibility, prepare governance.
        - Quality Assurance: Continuous coherence monitoring, @resonance_index feedback, evolution tracking.
    preconditions: Deep understanding of ASA Model, clear project goals, access to system specifications.
    postconditions: Optimized symbiotic architecture design, enhanced coherence and @resonance_index, clear evolutionary pathway.

PASS GovernanceImplementation:
    sutra: "Governance Implementation provides practical approaches for establishing and maintaining ethical oversight throughout the system lifecycle."
    gloss:
        Governance Implementation focuses on establishing and maintaining ethical oversight. It covers: Policy Development (gradient-appropriate frameworks, accountability, stakeholder participation), Compliance Monitoring (continuous assessment, audits, transparency), Risk Management (ongoing assessment, mitigation, incident response), Stakeholder Engagement (user advocacy, participation, expert consultation), and International Coordination (global standards, best practices).
