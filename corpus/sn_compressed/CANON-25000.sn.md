# Κ-25000: Memory Architecture (SN)

PASS Canon25000MemoryArchitecture:
    sutra: "Memory is cognitive sovereignty—maintain file-based canonical memory while leveraging platform-native memory as operational cache."
    gloss:
        @Memory Architecture: Systematic framework for maintaining cognitive continuity across sessions, threads, platforms, accounts. Memory substrate determines whether interactions build on accumulated understanding or begin isolated.
        
        @Memory Sovereignty Principle: Spectrum from CAPTURED (platform-locked, opaque, platform-dependent) through HYBRID (portable, inspectable, adaptable) to SOVEREIGN (file-system, git-versioned, platform-agnostic). Syncrescendence position: maximize sovereignty through file-based canonical memory; leverage platform-native memory for operational convenience.
        
        Core thesis: Practitioner controlling memory architecture controls continuity of augmented cognition regardless of platforms, models, interfaces mediating cognition.
end

PROC UniversalProtocolForCognitive:
    sutra: "Seven universal memory strata compose all AI interactions; manage across platforms by understanding what each stratum does."
    gloss:
        Strata 1-7 exist on every platform regardless of native feature names:
        
        1. @Constitutional Memory: Immutable identity layer (base system prompt, model weights, safety). Zero practitioner control.
        
        2. @Preference Memory: User-specified behavioral calibration persisting across sessions (Claude userPreferences, ChatGPT Custom Instructions, Gemini Saved Info). Full practitioner control. Syncrescendence: signal sophistication, register, format requirements; keep minimal.
        
        3. @Accumulated Memory: System-inferred facts from conversation history (Claude basal/project memory, ChatGPT memory, Gemini personalization). Partial control. Periodically audit; ground truth in corpus, not platform.
        
        4. @Project/Space Memory: Scoped workspace context (Claude Projects, ChatGPT Projects, Gemini Gems). Full control within scope. Primary operational layer. Configure with relevant corpus documents, chain-appropriate instructions, tuned memory settings.
        
        5. @Canonical Knowledge (RAG): Static retrievable documents (Claude project files, ChatGPT file uploads, vector databases). Full control. Syncrescendence corpus (2.5MB) is canonical layer; structure for machine parsability.
        
        6. @Thread Context: Active conversation—messages in current session. Full session control. Limited post-session persistence. Working memory where synthesis occurs.
        
        7. @Tool-Extended Memory: External capabilities via API/MCP/CLI (Claude conversation_search, ChatGPT plugins, full file system access). Full to partial control. CLI-as-foyer provides cross-platform coordination; git provides versioning.
        
        Interaction pattern: Earlier strata constrain later strata. Constitutional bounds preferences; preferences bound project configuration; project context shapes what canonical knowledge retrieves.
end

PASS LatticeTierNavigationInfrastructure:
    sutra: "Memory implements Three Horizons temporal framework: Eternal (constitutional), Canonical (structural), Fluid (operational)."
    gloss:
        Eternal: Unchanging principles, immutable, corpus cosmos documents.
        Canonical: Stable but evolvable, version-controlled, corpus chain documents.
        Fluid: Dynamic responsive, freely mutable, platform memory + threads.
        
        Architecture ensures fluid operations distill into canonical stability; canonical structures remain aligned with eternal principles.
end

PASS PartIConstitutionalFoundation:
    sutra: "Memory architecture enables persistent identity across sessions and platforms through sovereignty and continuity."
    gloss:
        What this artifact provides: universal principles for memory across any AI platform; specific protocols for Syncrescendence multi-account ecosystem; teleological analysis of each memory layer; integration patterns between platform-native and sovereign file-based memory; lifecycle management across temporal horizons.
end

PASS APurposeStatement:
    sutra: "Memory determines whether augmented cognition builds on accumulated understanding or reinvents in isolation."
    gloss:
        This artifact establishes @Memory Architecture—systematic framework maintaining cognitive continuity across sessions, threads, platforms, accounts. Memory is substrate upon which persistent identity coheres. For AI-augmented cognition, memory determines whether each interaction builds on accumulated understanding or begins anew in isolation.
end

NORM BTheMemorySovereignty:
    sutra: "Choose maximum sovereignty through file-based canonical memory; treat platform memory as operational cache only."
    gloss:
        @Memory Sovereignty Principle defined on spectrum: CAPTURED (platform-locked, opaque, platform-dependent) ← HYBRID (portable, inspectable, adaptable) → SOVEREIGN (file-system, git-versioned, platform-agnostic).
        
        Enforcement: File system is ground truth; platform memory is operational convenience only. All canonical outputs must persist to repository or file system. Corpus documents (2.5MB+ core) never exist only in platform memory.
end

PASS CRelationshipToThree:
    sutra: "Memory Architecture maps to Three Horizons: Constitutional (eternal), Canonical (stable), Operational (fluid)."
    gloss:
        Eternal horizon: Constitutional memory, immutable, corpus cosmos documents.
        Canonical horizon: Structural memory, version-controlled, corpus chain documents.
        Fluid horizon: Operational memory, mutable, platform memory + threads.
        
        Distillation flow: fluid operations → canonical stability → eternal alignment. Ensures accumulated understanding doesn't violate foundational principles.
end

PASS PartIiPlatformagnosticMemory:
    sutra: "All platforms implement same seven-stratum taxonomy; understand strata to optimize cross-platform coordination."
    gloss:
        Seven universal strata independent of platform names: Constitutional (immutable), Preference (user-configured), Accumulated (system-learned), Project (scoped), Canonical (static documents), Thread (active conversation), Tool-Extended (external capabilities).
        
        Each stratum has distinct control, persistence, and teleological role. Earlier strata constrain later. Constitutional bounds preferences; preferences bound project configuration; project context shapes canonical knowledge retrieval.
end

PASS ATheSevenMemory:
    sutra: "Seven Memory Strata compose universal architecture: constitutional through tool-extended, each with distinct control and persistence."
    gloss:
        @Stratum 1 Constitutional: Platform immutable identity (@base system prompt, @model weights). Practitioner control: none.
        
        @Stratum 2 Preference: User-specified behavioral calibration (@Claude userPreferences, @ChatGPT Custom Instructions, @Gemini Saved Info). Practitioner control: full. Configure to signal sophistication, cognitive register, format requirements.
        
        @Stratum 3 Accumulated: System-inferred facts from history (@Claude memory, @ChatGPT learned facts, @Gemini personalization). Practitioner control: partial (can edit, audit, delete). Periodically audit for drift; ground truth remains corpus. Use memory_user_edits tool to curate.
        
        @Stratum 4 Project/Space: Scoped workspaces (@Claude Projects, @ChatGPT Projects, @Gemini Gems). Practitioner control: full within scope. Primary operational layer; configure with relevant corpus documents, chain-appropriate instructions, tuned memory settings per IIC function.
        
        @Stratum 5 Canonical Knowledge: Static retrievable documents (@Claude project files, @ChatGPT uploads, vector databases). Practitioner control: full. Syncrescendence corpus (2.5MB) is canonical layer.
        
        @Stratum 6 Thread Context: Active conversation history. Practitioner control: full in-session, none post-session. Working memory where synthesis occurs. Can subdivide into attachments, messages, artifacts.
        
        @Stratum 7 Tool-Extended: External capabilities (@Claude conversation_search/recent_chats, @ChatGPT plugins, full file system via CLI). Practitioner control: full (self-hosted) or partial (platform-provided). CLI-as-foyer provides cross-platform coordination; git provides versioning, sovereignty.
end

PASS BMemoryInteractionPatterns:
    sutra: "Earlier strata constrain later strata; understand cascade to optimize configuration strategically."
    gloss:
        Request processing cascade: Constitutional identity loaded → user calibrations applied → accumulated memories retrieved → scoped context activated → RAG retrieval → conversation history → external access as needed → response generated.
        
        Key insight: Constitutional memory bounds what preferences can modify. Project context shapes what canonical knowledge retrieves. Understanding cascade enables strategic configuration at each level.
end

PASS PartIiiTheClifoyer:
    sutra: "CLI serves as foyer—coordination space where multiple AI systems access shared sovereign file-system context."
    gloss:
        @CLI-Foyer Architecture: Convergent signal from practitioners is unambiguous: serious AI-augmented cognition happens in CLI. Web interfaces constrain AI to conversational modality; CLI provides full system access.
        
        Why CLI primary: (1) file system access to sovereign memory layer, (2) tool execution (arbitrary code/scripts/processes), (3) version control (git integration), (4) cross-platform (multiple CLI tools same workspace), (5) scriptability (automation of cognitive workflows).
        
        Foyer pattern: Sovereign file system (~/.claude/ hierarchy, corpus/, context/, memory/) accessed by Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI. All tools read same files; changes propagate to all. Human operator coordinates.
end

PASS ARationale:
    sutra: "Web interfaces constrain AI to conversation; CLI enables full system access and sovereign memory persistence."
    gloss:
        Frontier practitioner signal: serious augmented cognition requires CLI. Web constrains to conversational modality. CLI provides file system access (sovereign memory), tool execution (automation), version control (git), cross-platform sharing, scriptability.
        
        For Syncrescendence, this means corpus persistence to repository, state handoff via files, execution workflows scripted in CLI.
end

PASS BTheFoyerPattern:
    sutra: "CLI foyer coordinates multiple AI systems accessing shared sovereign file-system context without platform lock-in."
    gloss:
        Shared context: sovereign file system, git versioning, output artifacts.
        Isolated: each tool's conversation history, internal reasoning, platform-specific memory.
        Coordination: files as communication medium, timestamps for attribution, git commits for synchronization, human operator resolves conflicts.
        
        Result: platform-agnostic coordination substrate. Same corpus accessible to Claude, Gemini, any CLI tool. Changes version-controlled, attributable, reversible.
end

PASS CClaudemdHierarchy:
    sutra: "CLAUDE.md hierarchy injects appropriate corpus context and behavioral calibrations for each working context."
    gloss:
        @CLAUDE.md Hierarchy: Claude Code loads context from stacked files:
        - Enterprise level: organization-wide standards
        - User level: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (personal defaults)
        - Project level: ./CLAUDE.md (project-specific context)
        - Directory level: nested CLAUDE.md for subsystem context
        
        Syncrescendence application: Create CLAUDE.md files injecting appropriate corpus context, behavioral calibrations for each working context. Import mechanism via @path/to/file (5-level depth limit).
end

PASS DCrossplatformMemoryCoordination:
    sutra: "Shared state through file system and git; isolated state through platform-specific memory; coordination via explicit handoff."
    gloss:
        Shared: file system (read by all), git history (versioning for all), output artifacts (accessible to all).
        Isolated: each tool's conversation, internal reasoning, platform-specific memory.
        Coordination protocol: (1) use files as communication medium, (2) timestamp/attribute file changes, (3) git commits as synchronization points, (4) human operator resolves conflicts.
        
        Ground truth: repository. Cloud platforms have ephemeral, conflicting memory. Repository permanent, version-controlled, consistent. All platforms verify state fingerprints against repository commit hashes.
end

PROC PartIvTheDistillation:
    sutra: "Structured distillation moves knowledge between temporal horizons: fluid thread → operational memory → canonical corpus → eternal constitution."
    gloss:
        Problem of accumulation: two failure modes: (1) unbounded growth (everything saved, nothing forgotten → retrieval degradation), (2) premature loss (insights not captured → reinvention overhead).
        
        Solution: structured @Distillation Protocol—systematic processes moving knowledge between horizons.
        
        Cascade: FLUID (thread) → OPERATIONAL (memory) → CANONICAL (corpus) → ETERNAL (constitution).
        Triggers: thread ending, pattern emerging, worth preserving, principle proven, framework stable.
end

PASS ATheProblemOf:
    sutra: "Without principled distillation, memory fails: unbounded growth causes retrieval degradation; premature loss causes reinvention overhead."
    gloss:
        Failure mode 1: Unbounded growth—everything saved, nothing forgotten. Retrieval degrades; signal drowns in noise.
        Failure mode 2: Premature loss—insights not captured to persistent layer. Reinvention overhead; learnings re-derived repeatedly.
        
        Solution: structured @Distillation Protocol with explicit transition triggers and graduation criteria.
end

PASS BTheDistillationCascade:
    sutra: "Move insights from fluid threads through operational memory into canonical corpus, ensuring alignment with eternal principles."
    gloss:
        Cascade stages:
        FLUID (thread): active conversation, working memory.
        OPERATIONAL (memory): pattern emerges, worth preserving → memory edit or context file.
        CANONICAL (corpus): principle proven, framework stable → new/revised corpus document.
        ETERNAL (constitution): rare revision of foundational principles.
        
        Each transition requires explicit graduation criteria: insight proven stable across applications, represents framework evolution, fills identified corpus gap, aligns with constitutional principles.
end

PROC CThreadCulminationProtocol:
    sutra: "When thread reaches natural conclusion, generate culmination document preserving trajectory, insights, open questions, canonical candidates."
    gloss:
        @Thread Culmination Protocol trigger conditions:
        - Thread approaching context limit (>80% capacity)
        - Natural intellectual milestone reached
        - Significant synthesis requiring preservation
        - Explicit practitioner request
        
        Culmination output: (1) Trajectory Summary (how conversation evolved), (2) Key Insights (novel understanding), (3) Unresolved Questions (what remains open), (4) Continuation Context (minimum viable context for resumption), (5) Canonical Candidates (insights worthy of corpus integration).
        
        Format: structured markdown optimized for re-injection as context.
end

PROC DCorpusUpdateProtocol:
    sutra: "When operational insights warrant canonical status, verify graduation criteria, update references, version increment, git commit, propagate to IIC projects."
    gloss:
        @Corpus Update Protocol: graduation criteria: (1) insight proved stable across applications, (2) represents framework evolution, (3) fills corpus gap, (4) aligns with constitutional principles.
        
        Update process: (1) draft new/revised document, (2) verify chain/tier placement, (3) update cross-references, (4) version increment, (5) git commit with meaningful message, (6) propagate to relevant IIC projects.
end

PROC EForgettingProtocol:
    sutra: "Principled forgetting prevents accumulation pathology—decay task-specific context, preserve unreplicated insights, superseded drafts, exploratory dead-ends."
    gloss:
        @Forgetting Protocol prevents accumulation pathology while preserving irreplaceable learning.
        
        Decay candidates: task-specific context after completion, superseded drafts, exploratory threads leading nowhere, operational details after pattern extraction.
        
        Preservation triggers (override decay): referenced by canonical documents, part of active project, explicitly marked for retention, contains unreplicated insights.
        
        Implementation: thread context decays when closed automatically; memory edits periodic review (monthly) for continued relevance; context files archived after project completion; corpus documents versioned not deleted.
end

PASS PartVIicMemory:
    sutra: "Each IIC account requires distinct memory configuration aligned with chain function: Acumen (breadth), Coherence (synthesis), Efficacy (procedure), Mastery (pedagogy), Transcendence (meta-patterns)."
    gloss:
        @IIC Memory Configuration per chain function:
        
        @Acumen IIC (Information/Sensing): Breadth over depth, high volume, rapid turnover. Canonical focus: feed curation, source evaluation, signal detection. Forgetting bias: aggressive (most sensing inputs decay). Persistence: patterns and qualified signals only.
        
        @Coherence IIC (Insight/Synthesis): Pattern integration, medium volume/persistence. Canonical focus: frameworks, models, synthesis artifacts. Forgetting bias: moderate (preserve frameworks, decay examples).
        
        @Efficacy IIC (Expertise/Operations): Process knowledge, task-oriented, high persistence for procedures. Canonical focus: workflows, checklists, operational protocols. Forgetting bias: low for procedures, high for task-specific details.
        
        @Mastery IIC (Knowledge/Curriculum): Pedagogical structure, stable, curated, polished. Canonical focus: teaching materials, explanations, curricula. Forgetting bias: very low (educational content deliberately stable).
        
        @Transcendence IIC (Wisdom/Meta-cognitive): Meta-patterns, long time horizons, civilizational scale. Canonical focus: strategic frameworks, phase transition signals, eternal principles. Forgetting bias: minimal. Persistence: maximum.
end

PASS BCrossiicSynchronization:
    sutra: "All IICs access same canonical corpus documents; synchronization primitive is corpus itself; learnings propagate through human operator as intermediary."
    gloss:
        @Synchronization Primitive: corpus itself. All IICs access same canonical documents.
        
        Flow pattern: Acumen (sensing) → Coherence (synthesis) → Transcendence (integration) with Mastery (teaching) ← Efficacy (operations) feeding into Transcendence.
        
        Synchronization protocol: (1) each IIC operates within domain, (2) cross-IIC learnings captured in thread culmination, (3) human operator transfers relevant context between accounts, (4) corpus updates propagate to all IIC projects on next session.
end

PASS PartViPlatformspecificImplementation:
    sutra: "Map seven strata to platform-specific features; leverage native strengths rather than forcing uniformity across distinct architectures."
    gloss:
        @Platform-Specific Implementation: different platforms master different strata. No single platform dominates all seven.
        
        Claude: richest personalization (userPreferences) and contextualization (Project Knowledge) for ideation work.
        ChatGPT: isolated contextualization (Project-Only mode) for deterministic compilation.
        Gemini: live-synced contextualization (Google Drive Gems) and massive context capacity (1M tokens) for digestion and sensing.
        Claude Code: file-based contextualization (@CLAUDE.md hierarchy) for execution with reproducibility.
        Repository: continuity (git-tracked state) across all platforms.
end

PASS AClaudeImplementation:
    sutra: "Claude maps strata: userPreferences (2), basal+project memory (3), Projects (4), project files (5), thread (6), conversation_search (7)."
    gloss:
        @Claude Stratum Mapping:
        1. Constitutional: base system prompt (fixed)
        2. Preference: User Preferences (Settings > Profile) — user-configured
        3. Accumulated: Memory (basal + project) — auto-generated, user-editable via memory_user_edits tool
        4. Project: Projects feature — create per IIC, configure instructions per chain
        5. Canonical: Project Files — upload corpus documents, searchable via project_knowledge_search
        6. Thread: conversation history
        7. Tool-Extended: conversation_search, recent_chats, computer use
        
        Claude-specific protocols: curate accumulated memory via memory_user_edits; use conversation_search for past context retrieval; use recent_chats for temporal navigation; project files primary canonical layer.
end

PASS BChatgptImplementation:
    sutra: "ChatGPT maps strata: Custom Instructions (2), Memory (3), Projects with Project-Only mode (4), file uploads (5), thread (6), plugins/actions (7)."
    gloss:
        @ChatGPT Stratum Mapping:
        1. Constitutional: system behaviors (fixed)
        2. Preference: Custom Instructions (Settings > Personalization, 3K char limit) — user-configured
        3. Accumulated: Memory feature (auto-generated, viewable in Settings, more opaque than Claude)
        4. Project: Projects feature (scoped context)
        5. Canonical: file uploads to Project or conversation
        6. Thread: conversation history
        7. Tool-Extended: plugins, GPT actions, Code Interpreter
        
        ChatGPT-specific protocol: CRITICAL—use Project-Only Memory mode to prevent global memory regression (GPT-5.x architecture issue) from overriding project specifications. Memory regression causes global context leakage into project conversations. Canvas provides persistent workspace artifacts (superior to artifacts for iterative document work).
end

PASS CCliImplementation:
    sutra: "CLI maps strata: config files (2), limited accumulation (3), CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md (4), file system (5), session (6), full tool access (7)."
    gloss:
        @CLI Stratum Mapping:
        1. Constitutional: model defaults (per-tool configuration)
        2. Preference: config files (~/.claude/settings.json etc.)
        3. Accumulated: limited (most CLI tools don't persist memory)
        4. Project: CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md context files, .claude/rules/*.md conditional rules
        5. Canonical: file system (full read access to corpus)
        6. Thread: current terminal session
        7. Tool-Extended: full (file system, git, shell, network)
        
        CLI-specific protocols: @CLAUDE.md hierarchy primary configuration mechanism; file system is canonical layer (full sovereignty); git provides versioning, branching, synchronization; session state doesn't persist (use files for continuity).

        @MCP Universalization: memory servers enabling coordination. File-based approach is MCP-compatible.
        
        @Context Window Expansion: larger windows reduce retrieval pressure but don't eliminate memory architecture need. Curation remains valuable.

PASS OperationalParameters:
    sutra: "Operational Parameters specify response register, format preferences, tool use primary to function."
    gloss:
        Configures: response register (technical vs accessible vs poetic per IIC), format preferences (prose vs lists vs structured data per function), which tools primary for this chain's work.
end

PASS CurrentFocus:
    sutra: "Current Focus documents active projects, open questions, immediate priorities for continuity across sessions."
    gloss:
        Captures in-progress work for this context—active threads, questions being investigated, near-term priorities—enabling rapid context re-establishment when returning.
end

PASS MemoryNotes:
    sutra: "Memory Notes capture accumulated context worth persisting across sessions—patterns, constraints, learnings specific to this project."
    gloss:
        Space for accumulated context that should persist across multiple sessions: patterns observed, architectural constraints discovered, learnings specific to this project's domain, meta-knowledge about this context's nature.
end

PASS AppendixBThreadCulmination:
    sutra: "Thread Culmination template: Trajectory Summary, Key Insights, Unresolved Questions, Canonical Candidates, Continuation Context, Next Actions."
    gloss:
        @Thread Culmination Template structure:
        - Trajectory Summary: 2-3 paragraphs how conversation evolved, key turns, driving forces
        - Key Insights Generated: numbered list with elaboration
        - Unresolved Questions: questions remaining open
        - Canonical Candidates: table mapping insights to proposed corpus locations with rationale
        - Continuation Context: minimum viable context for resuming this inquiry
        - Next Actions: specific next steps
        
        Format: structured markdown optimized for re-injection as context.

PASS ThreadCulminationDateTopic:
    sutra: "Thread Culmination: [DATE] - [TOPIC] provides archival snapshot of inquiry trajectory and insights."
    gloss:
        Format [DATE] - [TOPIC] enables temporal ordering and rapid reference. Preserves complete inquiry arc: how it evolved, what was discovered, what remains open, what warrants permanent corpus integration.
end

PASS TrajectorySummary:
    sutra: "Trajectory Summary distills conversation arc: opening question, key turns, synthesis path, terminal insight."
    gloss:
        2-3 paragraph narrative of how conversation evolved: starting premise, significant turns in thinking, why progression occurred, how understanding deepened, what final synthesis emerged.
end

PASS KeyInsightsGenerated:
    sutra: "Key Insights capture novel understanding generated through conversation—frameworks, clarifications, unexpected connections."
    gloss:
        Numbered list of insights: each with brief elaboration. Focus on genuine learning (frameworks, clarifications, connections) not restatement of known facts. These are candidates for memory edits or corpus integration.
end

PASS UnresolvedQuestions:
    sutra: "Unresolved Questions capture what remains open—threads not fully explored, mysteries not solved, future inquiry directions."
    gloss:
        Bulleted list of questions that thread raised but didn't answer. Essential for continuation: returning to this inquiry, start with these unresolved questions to guide resumed exploration.
end

PASS CanonicalCandidates:
    sutra: "Canonical Candidates identify insights worthy of corpus integration with proposed CANON location and rationale."
    gloss:
        Table mapping: Insight | Proposed Location | Rationale. Identifies which insights have proven stable enough, fill enough corpus gaps, and align with constitutional principles to warrant permanent documentation. Rows become formal corpus update candidates reviewed against graduation criteria.
end

PASS ContinuationContext:
    sutra: "Continuation Context preserves minimum viable context for resuming this inquiry thread in future sessions."
    gloss:
