# Κ-25000: Memory Architecture (SN)

PASS Canon25000MemoryArchitecture:
    sutra: "Memory is cognitive sovereignty; systematic framework for persistence across sessions, platforms, and accounts."
    gloss:
        @Memory Architecture establishes principled persistence for AI-augmented cognition. Memory determines whether interactions build upon accumulated understanding or begin anew. Core thesis: practitioner who controls memory architecture controls continuity of augmented cognition regardless of platforms/models/interfaces.
        Provides: universal principles applicable across AI platforms; protocols for multi-account ecosystem; teleological analysis of memory layers; integration patterns between platform-native and sovereign file-based memory; lifecycle management across temporal horizons.
end

PROC UniversalProtocolForCognitive:
    sutra: "Seven-layer memory taxonomy spans constitutional through tool-extended strata, universal across platforms."
    gloss:
        Preconditions: AI platform interaction required; practitioner agency over configuration.
        Steps:
        1. Understand @Seven Memory Strata across all platforms
        2. Configure platform-native memory (preferences, projects, custom instructions)
        3. Establish sovereign file-based memory (repository, CLAUDE.md)
        4. Route canonical knowledge through corpus documents
        5. Implement distillation lifecycle (thread → memory → corpus → constitution)
        Postconditions: unified memory architecture enabling seamless handoffs between platforms.
end

PASS LatticeTierNavigationInfrastructure:
    sutra: "CLI-foyer pattern coordinates sovereign file system with multiple platform CLIs for cross-system persistence."
    gloss:
        @CLI-Foyer Architecture treats file system as primary coordination space. Multiple CLI tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI) access shared ~/syncrescendence/ workspace. @Memory Sovereignty Principle: file system is ground truth; platform memory is operational cache.
        Synchronization primitive: shared corpus documents. Git provides versioning. Human operator resolves cross-platform conflicts.
end

PASS PartIConstitutionalFoundation:
    sutra: "Memory as cognitive sovereignty spans captured-to-sovereign spectrum; Syncrescendence maintains file-based canonical with platform-native operational cache."
    gloss:
        @Memory Sovereignty Principle positions systems on spectrum: CAPTURED (platform-locked, opaque) ↔ SOVEREIGN (file-system, git-versioned, auditable). Three Horizons alignment: Eternal = Constitutional Memory (immutable); Canonical = Structural Memory (version-controlled); Fluid = Operational Memory (freely mutable).
end

PASS APurposeStatement:
    sutra: "Framework maintains cognitive continuity across sessions, threads, platforms, and accounts via systematic memory management."
    gloss:
        Memory Architecture provides: universal principles for any platform; Syncrescendence ecosystem protocols; teleological analysis of each layer; platform integration patterns; temporal horizon lifecycle management.
end

NORM BTheMemorySovereignty:
    sutra: "Maintain maximum sovereignty through file-based canonical memory while leveraging platform-native memory for operational convenience."
    gloss:
        Rationale: Practitioner-controlled memory determines persistent identity and cognitive continuity. Platform-locked memory degrades sovereignty.
        Enforcement: File system = ground truth. Platform memory = operational cache. Versioning via git. Regular audit of accumulated memory for drift.
end

PASS CRelationshipToThree:
    sutra: "Three Horizons framework aligns with memory strata: Eternal/Constitutional, Canonical/Structural, Fluid/Operational across immutability and location."
    gloss:
        Eternal (unchanging) → Constitutional Memory (immutable) → Corpus cosmos documents
        Canonical (stable, evolvable) → Structural Memory (version-controlled) → Corpus chain documents
        Fluid (dynamic) → Operational Memory (freely mutable) → Platform memory, threads
        Distillation ensures fluid operations eventually crystallize into canonical stability while canonical structures remain aligned with eternal principles.
end

PASS PartIiPlatformagnosticMemory:
    sutra: "Seven-layer taxonomy spans Constitutional through Tool-Extended Memory, applicable across all platforms regardless of implementation."
    gloss:
        @Seven Memory Strata (universal across platforms):
        Layer 1 - @Constitutional Memory: immutable identity layer (model weights, base system prompt, platform defaults). Practitioner: no control.
        Layer 2 - @Preference Memory: user-specified behavioral calibrations (Claude Custom Instructions, ChatGPT Custom Instructions, Gemini Saved Info). Practitioner: full control.
        Layer 3 - @Accumulated Memory: system-generated inferences from history (Claude Basal/Project Memory, ChatGPT Memory, Gemini Personalization). Practitioner: partial control (view, edit, delete; generation automated).
        Layer 4 - @Project/Space Memory: scoped context for workspaces (Claude Projects, ChatGPT Projects, Gemini Gems, Perplexity Spaces). Practitioner: full control within scope.
        Layer 5 - @Canonical Knowledge RAG: static documents for retrieval (Claude Project Files, ChatGPT File uploads, vector databases). Practitioner: full control (curate, structure).
        Layer 6 - @Thread Context: active conversation, universal across platforms. Practitioner: full within session; cannot modify post-session on most platforms.
        Layer 7 - @Tool-Extended Memory: external capabilities via MCP/APIs/file system (Claude MCP servers, ChatGPT Plugins, CLI file access). Practitioner: full for self-hosted; partial for platform-provided.
end

PASS BMemoryInteractionPatterns:
    sutra: "Earlier strata constrain later strata; understanding cascade enables strategic configuration."
    gloss:
        Memory strata cascade: Constitutional (immutable) → Preferences (applied) → Accumulated (retrieved) → Project (activated) → Canonical (RAG) → Thread (active) → Tool-Extended (external).
        Key insight: Earlier layers constrain later layers. Constitutional bounds preferences. Project context shapes canonical retrieval. Distillation moves knowledge downward-in-layers (fluid → operational → canonical → eternal).
end

PASS PartIiiTheClifoyer:
    sutra: "CLI-as-foyer coordinates sovereign file system with multiple platform CLIs, enabling cross-platform memory coordination via shared files and git versioning."
    gloss:
        Rationale: CLI enables full system access. Web constrains to conversational modality. File system access provides sovereign memory layer. Version control enables time travel through memory states. Multiple CLI tools can access same workspace.
        @CLI-Foyer Architecture treats shared ~/syncrescendence/ directory as coordination space. Multiple AI systems (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI) access same files. Shared state: file system contents, git history, artifacts. Isolated state: each tool's conversation history and internal reasoning.
end

PASS ARationale:
    sutra: "CLI provides file system access, tool execution, version control, cross-platform capability, scriptability that web interfaces cannot."
    gloss:
        Web interfaces constrain to conversational modality. CLI enables: read/write to sovereign memory; arbitrary code execution; git integration for versioning; multiple CLI tools accessing shared workspace; automation of cognitive workflows.
end

PASS BTheFoyerPattern:
    sutra: "File system serves as coordination space where multiple AI systems access shared context via git-versioned files."
    gloss:
        Foyer pattern: ~/syncrescendence/ contains corpus/ (canonical documents), context/ (active context files), memory/ (distilled learnings), .claude/ (CLAUDE.md hierarchy). Multiple CLI tools access shared files. Human operator coordinates. Git commits synchronize state.
        Coordination: shared file system as communication medium; timestamp/attribute file changes; git commits as synchronization points; human operator resolves conflicts.
end

PASS CClaudemdHierarchy:
    sutra: "CLAUDE.md hierarchy (enterprise → user → project → directory) injects appropriate corpus context and behavioral calibrations per working context."
    gloss:
        Claude Code loads context from CLAUDE.md files in layers:
        1. Enterprise-level: organization-wide standards
        2. User-level: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (personal defaults)
        3. Project-level: ./CLAUDE.md (project-specific context)
        4. Directory-level: nested CLAUDE.md files for subsystem context
        Syncrescendence protocol: create CLAUDE.md files injecting corpus documents and chain-appropriate instructions for each working context.
end

PASS DCrossplatformMemoryCoordination:
    sutra: "File system provides shared state (contents, git history, artifacts); isolated state (conversation history, internal reasoning) per tool."
    gloss:
        Shared state: file system contents readable by all platforms; git history accessible to all; output artifacts accessible to all.
        Isolated state: each tool's conversation history; each tool's internal reasoning; platform-specific memory features.
        Coordination protocol: files as communication medium; timestamp/attribution of changes; git commits as synchronization points; human operator resolves conflicts.
end

PROC PartIvTheDistillation:
    sutra: "Distillation cascade moves knowledge from fluid threads through operational memory to canonical corpus to eternal constitution."
    gloss:
        Preconditions: thread reaching natural conclusion, context limit, or milestone; sustained insight worthy of preservation; framework evolution identified.
        Problem of accumulation: unbounded growth (retrieval degradation) vs. premature loss (reinvention overhead).
        Solution: @Distillation Protocol systematically moves knowledge between temporal horizons.
        Postconditions: fluid operations crystallized into canonical stability; canonical structures aligned with eternal principles; forgetting prevents accumulation pathology.
end

PASS ATheProblemOf:
    sutra: "Without principled distillation, memory systems face unbounded growth (retrieval degradation) or premature loss (reinvention overhead)."
    gloss:
        Failure modes: (1) everything saved → nothing forgotten → retrieval degradation; (2) important insights lost → reinvention overhead.
        Solution: structured distillation with lifecycle management across temporal horizons.
end

PASS BTheDistillationCascade:
    sutra: "Knowledge flows from fluid threads through operational memory to canonical corpus to eternal constitution via structured distillation."
    gloss:
        FLUID (Thread) → OPERATIONAL (Memory) → CANONICAL (Corpus) → ETERNAL (Constitution)
        Triggers: thread concludes; pattern emerges; principle proven; framework stable.
        Outputs: thread culmination; memory edit; corpus update; constitution revision (rare).
end

PROC CThreadCulminationProtocol:
    sutra: "At thread conclusion, capture trajectory, insights, questions, continuation context, and canonical candidates."
    gloss:
        Triggers: context limit (>80% capacity); natural intellectual milestone; significant synthesis; practitioner request.
        Steps:
        1. Generate trajectory summary (conversation evolution, key turns)
        2. Extract key insights (novel understanding generated)
        3. Document unresolved questions (what remains open)
        4. Prepare continuation context (minimum viable for resumption)
        5. Identify canonical candidates (insights worthy of corpus integration)
        Format: structured markdown optimized for re-injection as context.
        Postconditions: culmination document created; context preserved; ready for corpus integration evaluation.
end

PROC DCorpusUpdateProtocol:
    sutra: "Operational insights meeting stability/gap-filling/framework criteria graduate to canonical corpus via version-controlled updates."
    gloss:
        Graduation criteria:
        - Insight stable across multiple applications (not task-specific)
        - Represents genuine framework evolution (not local learning)
        - Fills identified gap in corpus coverage
        - Aligns with constitutional principles
        Steps:
        1. Draft new/revised document
        2. Verify @chain/@tier placement
        3. Update cross-references
        4. Increment version number
        5. Git commit with meaningful message
        6. Propagate to relevant @IIC projects
        Postconditions: canonical document added/updated; cross-references maintained; distributed to dependent systems.
end

PROC EForgettingProtocol:
    sutra: "Principled forgetting prevents accumulation pathology; decay candidates aged unless explicitly preserved."
    gloss:
        Decay candidates: task-specific context post-completion; superseded drafts; exploratory threads yielding nothing; operational details post-pattern-extraction.
        Preservation triggers (override decay): referenced by canonical documents; part of active project; explicitly marked for retention; unreplicated insights.
        Implementation: thread context decays automatically (thread closes); memory edits reviewed monthly; context files archived post-project; corpus documents versioned (not deleted).
end

PASS PartVIicMemory:
    sutra: "Each @IIC chain requires distinct memory configuration aligned with function: Acumen (breadth), Coherence (synthesis), Efficacy (procedures), Mastery (pedagogy), Transcendence (meta)."
    gloss:
        Acumen IIC (sensing): high volume, rapid turnover; fade bias aggressive; only patterns/signals persist.
        Coherence IIC (synthesis): medium volume/persistence; preserve frameworks, fade examples.
        Efficacy IIC (operations): procedure persistence high, task-detail persistence low.
        Mastery IIC (pedagogy): very low fade bias; educational content deliberately stable.
        Transcendence IIC (meta): minimal decay; meta-patterns accumulated longest timescales.
end

PASS APeriicMemoryConfiguration:
    sutra: "Acumen prioritizes breadth; Coherence prioritizes synthesis; Efficacy prioritizes procedures; Mastery prioritizes pedagogy; Transcendence prioritizes meta-patterns."
    gloss:
        Each @IIC configured for distinct function:
        Acumen: info/sensing; high volume, rapid decay; preserve only patterns
        Coherence: insight/synthesis; preserve frameworks, fade examples
        Efficacy: expertise/operations; high procedure persistence, task-detail decay
        Mastery: knowledge/curriculum; low fade; stable educational content
        Transcendence: wisdom/meta; minimal decay; long-timescale accumulation
end

PASS BCrossiicSynchronization:
    sutra: "Corpus documents serve synchronization primitive; cross-IIC learnings captured in thread culminations and transferred by operator."
    gloss:
        Synchronization mechanism: all @IIC accounts access same canonical corpus documents.
        Flow: Acumen (sensing) → Coherence (synthesis) → Transcendence (integration); Mastery (teaching) ← Efficacy (operations) ← Transcendence.
        Protocol: each @IIC operates within domain; cross-IIC learnings captured in thread culmination; operator transfers context between accounts; corpus updates propagate to all projects.
end

        Implication: important outputs should go to Project Knowledge (persistent visible) or repository (permanent)
end

PASS IiiChatgptMemoryArchitecture:
    sutra: "ChatGPT implements five-layer hierarchy: global custom instructions, global memory, project configuration, conversation context, canvas persistence."
    gloss:
        Global instructions establish baseline (two fields: "know about you," "respond to you")
        Global memory: passive learning from all conversations, account-wide scope
        Projects: isolated workspaces with Project-Only Memory mode (prevents global bleed)
        Canvas: persistent workspace artifacts surviving sessions
        Problem: memory regression in GPT-5.x; global memory overrides project context unpredictably
        Mitigation: use Project-Only Memory mode for COMPILER role
end

PASS Layer1GlobalCustom:
    sutra: "Global custom instructions establish baseline personalization: two-field system for identity and response style."
    gloss:
        Location: Settings → Personalization → Custom Instructions
        Fields: "What would you like ChatGPT to know about you?", "How would you like ChatGPT to respond?"
        Teleology: baseline personalization without explicit configuration for each conversation
end

PASS Layer2GlobalMemory:
    sutra: "ChatGPT observes conversations and extracts persistent facts, building cumulative user model across all conversations."
    gloss:
        Mechanism: automatic fact extraction from conversation history
        Scope: all conversations unless project restricts
        Persistence: permanent until manually deleted
        Problem: passive learning can drift from intent
        Mitigation: audit regularly; Project-Only Memory mode for deterministic contexts
end

PASS Layer3ProjectspecificConfiguration:
    sutra: "Projects create isolated workspaces with custom instructions, file uploads (25-40, 512MB each), memory mode toggle."
    gloss:
        Components: custom instructions, file uploads, project memory mode
        Capacity: 25-40 files, 512MB per file
        Critical control: Project-Only Memory mode restricts context to project files/history
        Teleology: prevent global memory bleed; enable specification-driven behavior
end

PASS Layer4ConversationContext:
    sutra: "ChatGPT threads persist indefinitely with progressive context eviction; can resume month-old threads; different from Claude's harder limits."
    gloss:
        Behavior: threads continue indefinitely; older context evicts; thread structure persists
        Implication: extended compilation tasks can span sessions
        Advantage: COMPILER role can dispatch specification, receive partial output, return later to continue
end

PASS Layer5CanvasWorkspace:
    sutra: "Canvas provides side-by-side document/code editor with session-persistent artifacts, enabling iterative refinement beyond conversation scope."
    gloss:
        Persistence: Canvas content persists across sessions
        Teleology: iterative refinement of work products; unique to ChatGPT
        COMPILER strength: document production surface where artifacts mature
end

PASS IvGeminiMemoryArchitecture:
    sutra: "Gemini implements five-layer hierarchy: saved info, personal intelligence (connected apps), gems (custom personas), conversation context (1M tokens), NotebookLM."
    gloss:
        Unique strength: Personal Intelligence connects Gmail/Drive/Calendar/Photos; Gems link to live Google Drive files (auto-updating).
        1M token context window: largest in industry (750k words; entire LOTR trilogy).
        NotebookLM: zero-hallucination grounded responses with citations.
        Architecture: enables fastest state sync for DIGESTOR role via Drive connection.
end

PASS Layer1SavedInfo:
    sutra: "Explicit persistent preferences established through natural language instruction rather than passive learning."
    gloss:
        Mechanism: explicit—"Remember I prefer concise responses"
        Scope: applies globally
        Persistence: permanent until edited
        Tradeoff: more effort to establish, but clearer control
end

PASS Layer2PersonalIntelligence:
    sutra: "Connected Google Apps (Gmail, Drive, Photos, Search, YouTube) provide ground truth for responses, distinctive to Gemini
