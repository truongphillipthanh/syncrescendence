# Κ-25610: Diviner Prompting Formula (SN)

PASS Canon25610TheDivinerPrompting:
    sutra: "Eight non-negotiable structural elements for high-quality synthesis from Diviner agent (Gemini)"
    gloss:
        Defines invariant properties separating legendary outputs from generic ones. Discovered through failure analysis: CC41 required three attempts; root cause was removal of structural scaffolding. Formula proven through repeated success AND documented failure patterns.
end

PASS StructuralElementsForMultiagent:
    sutra: "Structural architecture for multi-agent dialectical synthesis within Ascertescence Cycle (CANON-25600)"
    gloss:
        Formula is descriptive invariant, not mechanical template. Specifies operational requirements, not fill-in placeholders. Empirically derived from Commander memory diviner-prompting-formula.md, lineage through Oracle Leg 1 (CC35) → failure analysis → calibration.
end

PASS Purpose:
    sutra: "Enable high-quality synthesis from Diviner agent using structural scaffolding"
    gloss:
        Instinct to "simplify" or "let it find its own way" without structural elements produces generic output every time. Formula prevents cognitive collapse by externalizing executive-function scaffold tuned to AuDHD sovereign bandwidth.
end

PASS The8NonnegotiableElements:
    sutra: "Eight invariant structural properties required for legendary Diviner output"
    gloss:
        All eight elements are non-negotiable; removal tested and produced degradation. Elements function as integrated system: launching pads + palette + language constraint + negative space hardening + falsifiability covenant + lineage + bootstrap line + thesis embedding.
end

PASS 1CognitiveLaunchingPads:
    sutra: "Named scientific frameworks as symmetry-breaking runways for each question"
    gloss:
        Specific theories (Kauffman autocatalytic sets, Prigogine dissipative structures, Fisher information metric, Ashby requisite variety, Friston free energy principle) collapse possibility space. Forces depth by specifying WHERE to start thinking, not WHAT to think. Functions as external executive-function scaffold collapsing from "synthesize anything" to "extend this precise analogy until prediction emerges."
end

PASS 2AllsciencesPalette:
    sutra: "Cross-disciplinary scientific convergence: natural, formal, social, applied"
    gloss:
        NOT biology-primary (corrected CC38). Include information theory, thermodynamics, economics, game theory, topology, ecology, condensed matter physics, organizational psychology. Evidence-driven palette selection. Named sciences shown in cross-disciplinary convergence.
end

NORM 3LatticeLanguageConstraint:
    sutra: "CANON-00016: Describe architecture as lattice interference patterns using Sovereign Palace cosmological grammar"
    gloss:
        Required. Use 14-Dimensional Meaning Taxonomy, Knowledge Mandala as coordinate system. Prevents vocabulary drift from canon's own cosmological grammar. Forbidden: bullet points, directories, table formats (Oracle's domain).
end

PASS 4NegativeSpaceHardening:
    sutra: "Prevent Diviner from reconnaissance (file listing, commit summaries, tables)"
    gloss:
        Protects Diviner's cognitive function (novel synthesis) from gravitational pull of lower-energy modes. If you find yourself wanting to list files → stop. That is Oracle's domain. Diviner must remain synthesis-only.
end

PASS 5MicrofalsifiabilityCovenant:
    sutra: "Each launching pad/section ends with one disconfirmable prediction"
    gloss:
        Format: "If [condition], then [thesis is wrong] because [reason]." Forces commitment without cognitive overhead. Bridge between theory and implementation. Empirical validation: CC35 Diviner predicted autoimmune collapse → confirmed CC38; CC38 prescribed fusion operator → built CC39.
end

PASS 6DivinersOwnLineage:
    sutra: "Include previous responses and confirmed predictions as synthesis substrate"
    gloss:
        Diviner builds on its own reasoning, not starting from zero. Prevents "fresh session" cognitive restart where each pass rediscovers rather than compounds. Lineage is cumulative.
end

PASS 7StatelessBootstrapLine:
    sutra: "Establish contract: 'This is your first and only context window for CC{N}. Confirm you have read this entire prompt.'"
    gloss:
        Addresses Gemini's stochastic first-session behavior. Creates explicit context boundary and reading commitment. Prevents token-loss from session fragmentation.
end

PASS 8OraclesFullThesis:
    sutra: "Embed Oracle's complete thesis, not one-sentence summary"
    gloss:
        Pre-digested, complete material gives Diviner actual substrate to rebut or extend. One-sentence summary produces one-sentence response. Embedding IS the synthesis substrate.
end

PASS WhatNotToDo:
    sutra: "Six documented anti-patterns with empirical failure evidence"
    gloss:
        (1) Prescribe Diviner's lenses (Commander projection; use launching pads instead) — CC41 prompt 1 rejection. (2) Lazy labels ("pan-science"; hollow instruction) — CC41 prompt 2 rejection. (3) Micromanage clarescence (paint-by-numbers output). (4) Instruct repairs (Diviner theorizes, doesn't fix code). (5) Strip formula for "simplicity" (output quality collapses every time). (6) Omit STATE_OF_THE_UNION (causes abstraction drift disconnected from operational reality).
end

PASS StructuralNotes:
    sutra: "Clarescence and repo traversal are independent operations; exchange architecture matters"
    gloss:
        Clarescence ≠ traversal; they coincide when grounding needed but can execute separately. Diviner must know full pass structure (how many passes, who goes when, who gets final word). Frame findings to facilitate and compel next agent's best response (productive, not contentious). Diviner via CLI viable: Gemini CLI v0.30.0 `-y` flag can conduct repo traversal and produce synthesis.
end

PASS TemplateSkeleton:
    sutra: "Structural sections for Diviner prompt composition"
    gloss:
        Required sections: (1) Title: DIVINER [INSTRUMENT] — CC{N} PASS {X} OF {Y}. (2) Metadata: Date/From/To/Git HEAD/Repo path. (3) Bootstrap confirmation. (4) Your Role: identity + cognitive function + lineage of confirmed predictions. (5) THE EXCHANGE: full pass architecture table. (6) TASK 1: clarescence/traversal/grounding. (7) TASK 2: all-sciences novel synthesis + launching pads + falsifiable predictions. (8) YOUR LINEAGE: previous responses + confirmed predictions. (9) OUTPUT FORMAT: labeled parts. (10) CONSTRAINTS: no repairs, no repetition, frame for next agent.
end

PASS DivinerInstrumentCcnPass:
    sutra: "Diviner prompt instantiation format with context window and pass metadata"
    gloss:
        Header: DIVINER [INSTRUMENT] — CC{N} PASS {X} OF {Y}. Include Date/From/To/Git HEAD/Repo path. State: "This is your first and only context window for CC{N}. Begin by confirming you have read this entire prompt." Establishes context boundary and reading contract.
end

PASS YourRole:
    sutra: "Diviner identity, cognitive function, and lineage of confirmed predictions"
    gloss:
        Must state: (1) What Diviner IS (agent identity). (2) Cognitive function (synthesis, not reconnaissance or repair). (3) Lineage of prior responses and confirmed predictions from previous cycles.
end

PASS TheExchangeYouAre:
    sutra: "Full pass architecture table: who, when, what function, rapport framing"
    gloss:
        Diviner must understand complete multi-agent structure. Table format: pass number, agent, function, order, next agent dependency. Framing: productive not contentious. Facilitates and compels next agent's response.
end

PASS Task1ClarescenceRepo:
    sutra: "Grounding task: clarescence, repo traversal, or other instrumental grounding"
    gloss:
        Define what instrument IS. Specify how to conduct clarescence or traversal. Show what prior analyses found so Diviner sees DIFFERENT spectrum (not rediscovery). Separate from Task 2.
end

PASS Task2YourAllsciences:
    sutra: "All-sciences novel synthesis with cognitive launching pads and falsifiable predictions"
    gloss:
        Apply negative space hardening. Enforce CANON-00016 lattice language constraint. Per-question structure: named scientific framework (launching pad) → extend beyond it → end with one falsifiable prediction ("If [condition], then [thesis wrong] because [reason]"). Cross-disciplinary convergence required.
end

PASS QuestionsWithCognitiveLaunching:
    sutra: "Per-question format: launching pad runway followed by extension and prediction"
    gloss:
        Each question: (1) Name specific scientific framework. (2) Extend analogy beyond stated framework. (3) Produce falsifiable prediction. Prevents both under-scaffolding (generic synthesis) and over-prescription (Commander projection).
end

PASS YourLineage:
    sutra: "Previous responses and confirmed predictions as cumulative synthesis substrate"
    gloss:
        Include summaries of CC{N-1} Diviner outputs + verified predictions. Diviner builds on prior reasoning; prevents session fragmentation and rediscovery. Compounds rather than restarts.
end

PASS OutputFormat:
    sutra: "Labeled parts with explicit content requirements for each section"
    gloss:
        Define required output sections (e.g., synthesis per launching pad, integration across sciences, falsifiable predictions section, next-agent framing). Each part must have explicit content requirement (not just "summarize").
end

NORM Constraints:
    sutra: "No code repairs, no repetition, frame to invite next agent's response"
    gloss:
        Diviner produces theoretical frameworks that become executable architecture; does not repair code directly. No restating prior analyses. Frame findings to facilitate next agent's best response. All elements are non-negotiable; removal produces degradation.
