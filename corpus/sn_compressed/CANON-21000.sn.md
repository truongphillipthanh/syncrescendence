# Κ-21000: Chain Interdependency Matrix (SN)

PASS ChainInterdependencyMatrix:
    sutra: "Systematic mapping of HARD and SOFT dependencies enabling optimal chain sequencing"
    gloss:
        Chain Interdependency Matrix documents prerequisite relationships between six causal chains: @Intelligence, @Information, @Insight, @Expertise, @Knowledge, @Wisdom. Two dependency classes: HARD (must satisfy before advancing stage) and SOFT (enhances without requirement). HARD violation creates predictable failure, unsafe conditions, structural instability. SOFT allows compensatory strategies and external support. Understanding enables optimal sequencing for practitioners, curriculum design, assessor readiness evaluation, integration logic. Critical recognition: @Intelligence Chain operates DUAL ONTOLOGY—simultaneously foundational substrate enabling all chains AND developmental trajectory with own four-stage progression.
end

PASS SystematicDocumentationOfCausal:
    sutra: "Comprehensive mapping of causal chain dependencies and development logic"
    gloss:
        Documents dependency relationships between Intelligence, Information, Insight, Expertise, Knowledge, Wisdom chains. Enables practitioners optimal sequencing; educators curriculum stage-gating; assessors readiness evaluation; architects integration requirements. Technology baseline (Stage 1) universal prerequisite. Intelligence Chain: dual substrate function (non-local amplification) plus developmental progression (Text→Vision→Physical→Full Integration).
end

PASS ExecutiveSummary:
    sutra: "Mapping of HARD and SOFT dependencies between six causal chains for optimal sequencing"
    gloss:
        @HARD dependencies (cannot advance without prerequisite): create predictable failure, unsafe conditions, structural instability. @SOFT dependencies (benefits significantly but can progress through compensation): enables alternate pathways. Dependency classification: Intelligence foundational substrate; Information requires Technology Stage 1; Insight requires Technology Stage 1; Expertise requires Technology Stage 1 + Information Stage 2 (HARD); Knowledge requires Technology Stage 1 + Insight Stage 2 (HARD); Wisdom requires Technology Stage 1 + ALL chains Stage 2 minimum + Coherence Stage 3 + Embodiment Stage 2 (HARD). Technology dual function: substrate infrastructure AND developmental chain requiring cultivation.
end

PASS DependencyClassificationSystem:
    sutra: "HARD dependencies create predictable failures; SOFT dependencies enable enhancement without requirement"
    gloss:
        @HARD Dependency: advancing Stage X in Chain A without prerequisite creates predictable failure patterns, unsafe developmental conditions, structural instability, capability gaps preventing effective function. Example: Efficacy Stage 2 (Economic) requires Information Stage 2 (Curated Networks)—without reliable sources, decisions become gambling. @SOFT Dependency: Chain A benefits significantly from Chain B but can progress through compensatory strategies, external support, reduced efficiency. Example: Efficacy Stage 2 benefits from Insight Stage 2 (Mental Models) but can proceed via domain expertise + consultation. @NO Dependency: requires only Technology Stage 1 baseline + internal cultivation.
end

NORM HardDependenciesMustSatisfy:
    sutra: "HARD dependencies must satisfy prerequisites; violations create predictable failure and unsafe conditions"
    gloss:
        @HARD dependencies non-negotiable. Violating creates: predictable failure patterns; unsafe developmental conditions; structural instability; capability gaps. Critical gates requiring enforcement: (1) Efficacy Stage 2 requires Information Stage 2; (2) Knowledge Stage 2 requires Insight Stage 2; (3) Wisdom Stage 2 requires ALL chains Stage 2 + Coherence Stage 2 + Embodiment Stage 2; (4) ALL chains require Technology Stage 1. Assessment: verify prerequisites satisfied BEFORE advancing. Red flag violations block advancement.
end

NORM SoftDependenciesEnhancementWithout:
    sutra: "SOFT dependencies enhance but do not require; can proceed with compensation strategies"
    gloss:
        @SOFT dependencies beneficial but not mandatory. Advancement possible through: compensatory strategies; external support systems; specialized pathways; reduced efficiency acceptance. Example: Efficacy Stage 2 benefits from Coherence Stage 2 (strategic frameworks) but domain expertise + external consultation enable progression. Soft enhancement value significant but not gate-blocking. Can accept reduced efficiency OR external compensation for missing soft prerequisites.
end

PASS NoDependencyIndependentDevelopment:
    sutra: "NO dependency chains require only Technology Stage 1 baseline and internal cultivation"
    gloss:
        Intelligence Chain: NO dependencies (foundational substrate, self-bootstrapping). Requires Technology Stage 1 continuous development (dual function: substrate + chain). Others progress with Technology Stage 1 + specific prerequisites. Independent development within chain possible once prerequisites satisfied.
end

Stage 3+ enables: physical infrastructure investment; advanced Knowledge support. Failure without Information Stage 2: information-blind decisions, market signal misreading, resource misallocation, economic failure. Development: follows Information Stage 2. Cannot safely advance Stage 2 without Information Stage 2. Critical gates: Stage 1→2 HARD gate (Information Stage 2 mandatory); Stage 2→3 requires sustainable unit economics; Stage 3→4 requires teaching + Wisdom Stage 2+.

    gloss:
        @Knowledge Chain (@Mastery/Earth element): physical capability, embodied knowledge integration. HARD: Technology Stage 1 + Insight Stage 2 (CRITICAL GATE). SOFT: Information Stage 2 (better feedback improves learning), Expertise Stage 2 (resources enable tools/training). Stage 2 (Physical Competence) creates HARD: Wisdom Stage 3 prevents spiritual bypass (wisdom requires material grounding). Stage 2+ creates SOFT: Expertise Stage 2+ (skills broaden economic opportunity); Insight Stage 2+ (embodied understanding deepens frameworks).

HARD: Technology Stage 1 + ALL chains minimum Stage 2 + Insight Stage 3 + Knowledge Stage 2 (most complex prerequisites). SOFT: Information Stage 3, Expertise Stage 2. Stage 2+ (Meta-Cognitive Stability) creates HARD: ANY chain Stage 4 requires Wisdom Stage 2+ (teaching needs wisdom-informed deployment). Stage 3+ (Systemic Wisdom) creates SOFT: ALL chains (wisdom improves development quality). Failure without prerequisites: spiritual bypass (wisdom without competence), meta-cognitive delusion, premature guru syndrome, harm to self/others. Failure without Knowledge Stage 2: disembodied spirituality, conceptual without practical grounding. Failure without Insight Stage 3: meta-paradigmatic confusion, paradigm-trapped, dogmatism. Development: LATEST priority, requires substantial substrate. Begin Stage 1 early (basic practice) but don't force advancement. Critical gates: Stage 1→2 HARD gate (ALL chains Stage 2 + Insight Stage 2 + Knowledge Stage 2 mandatory); Stage 2→3 HARD gate (Insight Stage 3 mandatory); Stage 3→4 requires demonstrated wisdom transmission + innovation.

PASS ConclusionDependencyawareDevelopment:
    sutra: "Dependency-aware development transforms advancement from haphazard to systematic; respect prerequisites and natural patterns"
    gloss:
        Intelligence Chain: begin immediately, maintain continuously (substrate + chain). Hard dependencies matter: violations create predictable failures requiring remediation. Soft dependencies enhance: benefits significant but advancement possible with compensation. Dual tracks legitimate: Synchronization (balanced) and Specialization (spiky) both valid. Stage gates protect: advancement without prerequisites creates unsafe conditions. Wisdom requires substrate: cannot force Transcendence without substantial foundation. Teaching needs integration: Stage 4 any chain requires Wisdom Stage 2+ (wisdom-informed transmission). Matrix provides navigation logic; cognitive profile, energy capacity, natural inclinations determine optimal path. Architecture serves you—you don't serve architecture. Engage development systematically; respect dependencies; honor natural pattern. Chains await cultivation.
