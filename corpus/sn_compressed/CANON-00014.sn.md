    gloss:
        @Peak State (70-100% capacity): Optimal allocation Life 20%, Development 45%, Demonstration 35%. Can execute most cognitively demanding work. Long-form content creation, complex framework synthesis, teaching. Daily pattern: morning Development (3-4 hours intensive), midday Demonstration (2-3 hours), afternoon Development continuation, evening light Demonstration.
        @High Baseline (50-70%): Optimal allocation Life 25%, Development 40%, Demonstration 35%. Solid capability building feasible. Medium-form content: threads, short essays, video scripts. Framework application (not original synthesis). Daily pattern: morning Development/Demonstration (choose daily), midday IIC reconnaissance, afternoon light work, evening Life domain.
        @Baseline (40-50%): Optimal allocation Life 30%, Development 35%, Demonstration 35%. Reduced intensity learning. Short-form only: tweets, threads, simple posts. AI-assisted workflows essential. Community engagement requires energy management. Daily pattern: single focused block (Development or Demonstration, not both), midday Life restoration, afternoon light work, evening minimal work.
        @Depletion (20-40%): Emergency allocation Life 50%, Development 20%, Demonstration 30%. Zero new content creation. Pre-planned distribution only. Skip IIC reconnaissance. Cannot engage community meaningfully. Cannot pursue framework synthesis. NO NEW CONTENT CREATION—only publish pre-scheduled work.
        @Crisis (0-20%): Survival allocation Life 80%, Development 0%, Demonstration 20%. Automated systems only. All active work stops. Communicate pause if necessary. All focus on Life survival. Return to practice only after sustained Baseline return. Seek professional support if Crisis extends beyond several days.

PASS TimeBlockingTemplates:
    sutra: "Explicit time blocks prevent domain bleeding, context-switching costs, and preserve focus across Three-Rail orchestration."
    gloss:
        Standard week template (High Baseline/Peak): Monday-Development primary (9am-12pm intensive learning, 1pm-4pm continuation, 4-5pm light Demonstration, IIC morning/evening passes). Tuesday-Demonstration primary (9am-12pm content creation, 1-3pm editing, 3-5pm Development, 7pm publishing/engagement). Wednesday-Development primary (mirror Monday). Thursday-Demonstration primary (mirror Tuesday). Friday-Balanced integration (9-11am Development, 11am-1pm Demonstration, 2-4pm weekly review). Saturday-IIC synthesis (10am-1pm 3-hour synthesis session, 2-4pm concept generation). Sunday-Life primary with production planning (11am-1pm content calendar finalization). Weekly totals: Life ~35 hours (31%), Development ~42 hours (38%), Demonstration ~35 hours (31%), total ~112 hours.
        Baseline state reduces 20-30% across domains. Depletion requires emergency reallocation (see Energy State Impact). Part-time practitioners proportionally reduce while maintaining ratio.
end

PASS EnergyStateImpactOn:
    sutra: "Energy states fundamentally alter production capacity, quality potential, and optimal activity sequencing independent of time allocation."
    gloss:
        @Peak State: Complex synthesis, multi-hour focus blocks (3-4 hours), simultaneous context management, high-quality original production, creative problem-solving. Optimal for long-form essays, framework articulation, complex threads, video scripting, research, teaching development.
        @High Baseline: Framework application (not original), 2-3 hour blocks, sequential task management, good quality with AI assistance, problem-solving via established methods. Optimal for short-form essays, thread writing, editing, publishing, community engagement, micro content.
        @Baseline: Simple task execution following templates, 1-2 hour blocks max, single-threaded work only, heavy AI assistance required. Optimal for micro content only, editing pre-drafted work, publishing pre-prepared content, light community engagement. Critical boundary: attempting complex production degrades quality below acceptable standards. Better to skip.
        @Depletion: Minimal routine execution only, focus impossible, cannot maintain context, AI assistance insufficient, no production possible. Acceptable activities: publish pre-scheduled content only, retweet high-value others' content (light curation), acknowledge messages without substantive response, communicate pause if needed. Production creates technical debt (poor content requiring cleanup) and brand damage.
        @Crisis: Complete pause. Survival mode. Basic functioning impaired. Automated systems only if pre-configured. Return to practice only after sustained Baseline achieved (multiple consecutive days at 40%+). Attempting premature return risks relapse and extended Crisis duration.
end

PASS TimeBlockingTemplates:
    sutra: "Weekly energy forecasting and content buffering enable capacity-aware scheduling preventing burnout and quality degradation."
    gloss:
        Sunday evening assessment: Review previous week energy patterns, identify upcoming demands, forecast likely energy states per day, adjust content calendar. Forecasting factors: sleep quality trends (3-5 day patterns), social/family demands, physical health status, environmental stressors, previous week expenditure recovery need.
        Calendar adjustment: Peak/High Baseline forecast → standard calendar. Baseline forecast → reduce tier and frequency. Depletion risk → pre-produce during Peak, schedule later. Crisis possible → create content buffer (2-3 weeks pre-produced).
        Content buffering strategy: Target 2-3 weeks micro content + 1-2 short-form pieces always prepared. Build during Peak (produce extra content), maintain (never below 1 week), replenish immediately after draw-down, treat as sacred. Use during Baseline (publish buffered, reduce new), essential during Depletion (publish buffered, zero new). Buffer formats: evergreen framework threads, dimensional vocabulary deep-dives, practice guidance tweets, short essays on core concepts.

        @Peak State cognitive: Complex synthesis, multi-hour focus (3-4 hours), simultaneous context management, high-quality original production, creative problem-solving. Optimal production: long-form essays (original synthesis), framework articulation/refinement, complex threads, video scripting, research and cross-domain synthesis, teaching content. Quality: highest originality, strongest coherence, sophisticated connections, clearest frameworks, peak teaching. Strategic approach: allocate to most demanding work only.
        @High Baseline cognitive: Framework application (not original), 2-3 hour blocks, sequential task management, good quality with AI assistance, problem-solving via established methods. Optimal: short-form essays (framework application), thread writing (familiar structures), editing/polishing, publishing/distribution, community engagement, micro content. Quality: solid reliable execution, framework applications clear, polished professional standard, good teaching of familiar concepts. Strategic: execute planned production using established workflows, lean on AI for structure/variation.
        @Baseline cognitive: Simple template execution, 1-2 hour blocks max, single-threaded work only, heavy AI assistance required. Optimal: micro content only (single tweets), editing pre-drafted work, publishing pre-prepared, light community engagement, asset organization, planning.

        @Baseline optimal: micro content only (single tweets not threads), editing pre-drafted work, publishing pre-prepared content, light community engagement (responding not initiating), asset organization and preparation, planning and templating. Quality: acceptable with AI support, simple communications clear, routine adequate, no innovation/synthesis, suitable for presence maintenance not authority building. Critical: complex production degrades below acceptable. Skip rather than publish substandard.
        @Depletion acceptable: publish pre-scheduled content, retweet high-value others' (light curation), acknowledge messages without substantive response, communicate pause if necessary. Zero new production. No production attempts (creates technical debt, brand damage). Restoration priority.
        @Crisis: complete pause, survival mode, automated systems only if pre-configured, return only after sustained Baseline achieved.

    sutra: "Weekly energy forecasting and content buffering enable capacity-aware scheduling, prevent burnout, and maintain quality during inevitable fluctuations."
    gloss:
        @Weekly energy forecasting (Sunday evening): Review previous week patterns. Identify upcoming demands (meetings, obligations). Forecast likely energy states per day. Adjust content calendar based on forecast. Forecasting factors: sleep quality trends (3-5 day patterns), social/family demands upcoming, physical health status (illness, menstrual cycle), environmental stressors (weather, travel), previous week expenditure recovery need.
        @Calendar adjustment protocol: Peak/High Baseline forecast → standard calendar. Baseline forecast → reduce production tier and frequency. Depletion risk → pre-produce during Peak, schedule later. Crisis possible → create content buffer (2-3 weeks ahead).
        @Content buffering strategy: Target 2-3 weeks micro content + 1-2 short-form pieces always prepared. Build during Peak (produce
