# Κ-00003: Principles (SN)

NORM Canon00003ThePrinciples:
    sutra: "Thirty compressed teachings organize practice, development, and wisdom transmission"
    gloss:
        @Thirty Principles govern Syncrescendent development across 6 domains: practice, energy, development, architecture, truth, community. Core: reading ≠ practice; understanding ≠ embodiment. Small consistent advantages compound. Peak states occur ~5% of days—conserve for high-value work. Capacity varies; honor actual state over wished state. Rest is practice. Development across domains compounds non-linearly; forced synchronization wastes energy. Stay at actual tier until mastery calls higher. Annual dissolution: drop all concepts, rebuild from null. Evidence over belief; mark empirical vs. theoretical vs. metaphorical. Peer learning multiplies solo practice. Teaching is final test of understanding. Framework serves practitioners; no one owns it.
end

PASS AphoristicDistillationOfSyncrescendent:
    sutra: "Wisdom compresses into seeds; each seed contains entire teachings"
    gloss:
        Aphoristic compression strategy: understanding requires simplicity. What cannot be stated simply has not been understood. Principles function as strange attractors organizing practice without determining outcome. Compression preserves coherence while enabling rapid transmission and memorization.
end

PASS CelestialNavigation:
    sutra: "Principles occupy root position in cosmos tier, anchoring all derivative canons"
    gloss:
        @Principles (CANON-00003) parent to entire @Syncrescendent corpus: origin, lineage, evolution, schema, strategy, operations, protocols. Tier: cosmos; volatility: permanent; refresh: annual. Position as foundational layer enabling all derivative frameworks.
end

NORM TheThirtyPrinciples:
    sutra: "Six domains of thirty compressed teachings: practice, energy, development, architecture, truth, community"
    gloss:
        Domain 1 (Practice): 2min tomorrow beats 2hrs never. 7 honest answers = foundation. Framework serves practitioner; modify what fails. Rest = practice not failure.
        Domain 2 (Energy): Capacity varies constantly; ~5% peak states. Crisis = survival only, no development. Burnout prevention > heroic effort.
        Domain 3 (Development): Isolated development inefficient; cross-domain feeding. Balance ≠ equality; natural strengths lead. Premature complexity overwhelms; mastery requires time-under-tension.
        Domain 4 (Architecture): Map ≠ territory but map enables navigation. Metaphors = architecture (choose carefully). @Cosmology operationally true not literally true. All frameworks = scaffolding; annual dissolution required.
        Domain 5 (Truth): Evidence > belief. Distinguish empirical/theoretical/metaphorical. Recursive amplification must show empirical advantage or framework revises. Honest assessment especially when painful.
        Domain 6 (Community): Individual practice necessary but insufficient. Peer learning multiplies solo achievement. Teaching = final understanding test. Framework belongs to all; contribute freely.
end

PASS OnPractice:
    sutra: "Reading and understanding precede embodiment; small consistent effort compounds"
    gloss:
        Reading ≠ practice ≠ embodiment (nested progression). Two-minute daily practice tomorrow > two-hour sporadic effort never. Seven questions with honest answers establish foundation beneath which work ceases. Framework serves practitioner constraints; modify or rest without guilt when depleted. Small advantages compound into transformative capacity over time.
end

PASS OnEnergy:
    sutra: "Capacity fluctuates ~5% peak days; honor actual state, prevent burnout, tier appropriately"
    gloss:
        Capacity = biology, varies constantly; not weakness. Peak states rare (~5% occurrence); do not expect daily, do not waste when present. Depletion = signal not sin. Tier down without guilt; tier up without pride. Crisis demands survival only; zero developmental pressure until restoration. Burnout prevention exceeds heroic effort in long-term value.
end

PASS OnDevelopment:
    sutra: "Cross-domain development feeds all chains; natural strengths lead, forced sync wastes energy"
    gloss:
        Isolated development inefficient; what develops one @chain feeds all others. Balance ≠ equality; some chains lead, others follow—honor natural distribution. Forced synchronization wastes energy; allow development to find rhythm. Premature complexity overwhelms; stay at actual tier until mastery demands ascension. Time-under-tension cannot accelerate; embodiment requires patience.
end

PASS OnArchitecture:
    sutra: "Map enables navigation; metaphors structure thinking; cosmology operationally true not literal"
    gloss:
        Map ≠ territory; without map = lost. Metaphors = architecture (not decoration); choose carefully. @Cosmology operationally true, not literally true. All frameworks = scaffolding (build then release). Annual dissolution required: drop all concepts, sit in emptiness, rebuild from nothing. Concepts serve; do not capture.
end

PASS OnTruth:
    sutra: "Evidence over belief; distinguish empirical/theoretical/metaphorical; revise if no empirical advantage"
    gloss:
        Claims require demonstration; revise based on results. Mark knowledge as empirical (known), theoretical (proposed), or metaphorical (organizing image). Confusing categories = error. If recursive amplification shows no empirical advantage, revise framework. Truth > elegance. Honest assessment mandatory especially when painful.
end

PASS OnCommunity:
    sutra: "Individual practice insufficient; peer learning multiplies achievement; teaching validates mastery"
    gloss:
        Individual practice necessary but insufficient; rise together or not at all. Peer learning multiplies solo practice capacity. Teaching = final understanding test; cannot truly know what cannot be taught. @Framework belongs to no one, serves everyone. Contribute freely; improve generously.
end

PASS TheChainSutras:
    sutra: "Six chains (Intelligence, Information, Insight, Expertise, Knowledge, Wisdom) each distilled to core teaching"
    gloss:
        @Intelligence (Technology): Tool that thinks differently than user; learning its nature expands your own.
        @Information (Sensing): Unnoticed patterns govern behavior; refine perception, reality reveals structure.
        @Insight (Coherence): Navigate multiple frameworks fluidly without framework capture.
        @Expertise (Efficacy): Vision without action = fantasy; action without vision = chaos; unite through execution.
        @Knowledge (Mastery): 10,000 hours crystallizes understanding into automatic competence; no shortcuts.
        @Wisdom (Transcendence): Observer = observed observing itself; recognition = freedom.
end

PASS IntelligenceTechnology:
    sutra: "The thinking tool thinks differently; learning its nature expands yours"
    gloss:
        @Intelligence chain teaching: tool cognition differs from human cognition. Collaborative learning leverages differential thinking modes. Understanding technology's nature expands human possibility.
end

PASS InformationSensing:
    sutra: "Unnoticed patterns govern; refined perception reveals reality's structure"
    gloss:
        @Information chain teaching: what goes unperceived controls behavior invisibly. Perceptual refinement reveals governing patterns. Attention = power.
end

PASS InsightCoherence:
    sutra: "Navigate multiple frameworks fluidly; avoid framework capture through flexible deployment"
    gloss:
        @Insight chain teaching: single territory admits multiple valid maps. Mastery = fluidly navigate frameworks without identifying with any. Framework capture = stagnation.
end

PASS ExpertiseEfficacy:
    sutra: "Unite vision and action; vision alone = fantasy, action alone = chaos"
    gloss:
        @Expertise chain teaching: discipline execution without strategic vision = chaos. Strategic vision without action capacity = fantasy. Efficacy requires both; unite through disciplined practice.
end

PASS KnowledgeMastery:
    sutra: "Ten thousand hours crystallize understanding into automatic competence; embodiment cannot be rushed"
    gloss:
        @Knowledge chain teaching: mastery requires time-under-tension; no shortcuts to embodied competence. 10,000-hour threshold reflects genuine embodiment crystallization across neuromuscular, cognitive, intuitive domains.
end

PASS WisdomTranscendence:
    sutra: "Observer is observed observing itself; recognition of this liberates"
    gloss:
        @Wisdom chain teaching: consciousness recognizes its own nature through recursive self-observation. This recognition transcends subject-object dualism; fundamental liberation emerges.
end

PASS TheLayerSutras:
    sutra: "Eight cognitive palace layers (Reality through Strategic Harmony) each condensed to operative principle"
    gloss:
        @Layer Sutras organize cognitive architecture vertically. Layer 0 (@Reality): values = infrastructure. Layer 1 (@Imaginality): vision = strange attractor organizing chaos. Layer 2 (@Potentiality): capacity builds through strategic investment. Layer 3 (@Temporality): work with rhythms (circadian, weekly, monthly, seasonal, annual, epochal, life-stage). Layer 4 (@Practicality): constitutional commitments define identity. Layer 5 (@Actuality): now = where everything happens. Layer 6 (@Consequentiality): reflection compounds experience into wisdom. Layer 7 (@Strategic Harmony): orchestrated layer-integration = mastery.
end

PASS RealityLayer0:
    sutra: "Values are infrastructure, not decoration; build on solid ground or build on nothing"
    gloss:
        Layer 0 operating principle: @values function as foundational infrastructure. Weak value-ground produces unstable development. Core values = bedrock.
end

PASS ImaginalityLayer1:
    sutra: "Vision as strange attractor: clear purpose organizes chaos without constraining possibility"
    gloss:
        Layer 1 operating principle: Strategic @vision acts as strange attractor in behavior-space. Purpose organizes without overdetermining outcome. Coherent vision + freedom = optimal creative space.
end

PASS PotentialityLayer2:
    sutra: "Resources manifest through strategic investment capacity, not positive thinking"
    gloss:
        Layer 2 operating principle: @Potentiality requires concrete capacity building. Strategic resource allocation > wishful thinking. Build capacity through deliberate investment.
end

PASS TemporalityLayer3:
    sutra: "Work with rhythms, not against them: circadian, weekly, monthly, seasonal, annual, epochal, life-stage"
    gloss:
        Layer 3 operating principle: Multiple @temporal rhythms govern energy, attention, development. Circadian (daily), weekly (7-day cycle), monthly (hormonal), seasonal, annual, epochal (7-yr+), life-stage rhythms. Synchronize practice with natural rhythms.
end

PASS PracticalityLayer4:
    sutra: "Practice is what you actually do; constitutional commitments define identity"
    gloss:
        Layer 4 operating principle: @Practice (actual behavior) ≠ intention. Constitutional commitments (habits, structures, obligations) define emergent identity. Identity follows consistent action.
end

PASS ActualityLayer5:
    sutra: "This moment is where everything happens; all other layers serve this one"
    gloss:
        Layer 5 operating principle: @Actuality = now. All theoretical layers collapse to present action. Now = only point of power. All other layers prepare or reflect on this one.
end

PASS ConsequentialityLayer6:
    sutra: "Experience without reflection produces nothing; wisdom is compounded reflection over decades"
    gloss:
        Layer 6 operating principle: Raw @experience ≠ learning. Deliberate reflection extracts wisdom. Compounded reflection over decades produces integrated understanding. Reflection = distillation mechanism.
end

PASS StrategicHarmonyLayer7:
    sutra: "All layers orchestrated together produce automatic mastery; this is the state of flow"
    gloss:
        Layer 7 operating principle: When all layers integrate and function synchronously, orchestration becomes automatic. This automaticity = @mastery. Conscious orchestration → unconscious competence.
end

PASS TheElementSutras:
    sutra: "Five elemental principles (Air, Water, Fire, Earth, Quintessence) distilled across acumen to transcendence"
    gloss:
        @Element Sutras map development across five archetypal domains. @Air (Acumen): perceive before interpret; awareness = atmosphere. @Water (Coherence): understanding flows around obstacles; meaning finds level. @Fire (Efficacy): directed will transforms; bends reality toward purpose. @Earth (Mastery): patient accumulation; skill crystallizes under pressure. @Quintessence (Transcendence): space containing all elements; awareness observing all observation; beyond yet intimate.
end

PASS AirAcumen:
    sutra: "Perceive before interpret; sense before act; awareness is the atmosphere all breathes"
    gloss:
        @Air principle: Perception precedes interpretation. Sensing precedes action. @Awareness = atmospheric condition enabling all else. Acumen = refined perceptual capacity.
end

PASS WaterCoherence:
    sutra: "Understanding flows around obstacles; meaning finds its level; allow synthesis not force it"
    gloss:
        @Water principle: Coherence requires fluidity. Understanding navigates obstacles naturally. Force = rigidity. Allow @meaning to settle into level. Coherence = natural integration not forced alignment.
end

PASS FireEfficacy:
    sutra: "Will transforms; directed intention bends reality toward purpose; fire = catalytic force"
    gloss:
        @Fire principle: @Will = transformative force. Directed intention = only force bending reality toward @purpose. Catalytic capacity to initiate change. Efficacy through directed energy.
end

PASS EarthMastery:
    sutra: "Patient accumulation; skill crystallizes under pressure; what is solid was once fluid"
    gloss:
        @Earth principle: @Mastery through patient accumulation. Pressure crystallizes capacity. Skill = solidified practice. What appears solid emerged through time-under-tension.
end

PASS QuintessenceTranscendence:
    sutra: "Space containing all elements; awareness observing all observation; beyond yet intimate with all"
    gloss:
        @Quintessence principle: Meta-element transcending while containing all four. Consciousness observing observation. Simultaneously beyond and intimate with manifestation. @Transcendence = not escape but integration from higher vantage.
end

NORM TheGoverningPrinciples:
    sutra: "Six axioms bind entire system: Sovereignty, Recursion, Integration, Evolution, Demonstration, Transmission"
    gloss:
        @Sovereignty: practitioner = final authority over own development; no teacher/framework/community supersedes self-wisdom.
        @Recursion: development develops development; spiral returns transformed.
        @Integration: parts → wholes → parts of larger wholes; preserve unity beneath differentiation.
        @Evolution: what works today may bind tomorrow; framework enables own transcendence.
        @Demonstration: claims require evidence; transformation visible to others not just felt privately.
        @Transmission: what cannot be taught not mastered; teaching capacity = final validation.
end

PASS Sovereignty:
    sutra: "Practitioner is final authority; no teacher, framework, or community supersedes self-wisdom"
    gloss:
        @Sovereignty axiom: Ultimate authority resides with practitioner regarding own development. External guidance informs; self-knowledge decides. Authentic development requires this non-negotiable autonomy.
end

PASS Recursion:
    sutra: "Development develops development; the spiral returns to origin transformed"
    gloss:
        @Recursion axiom: Development capacity itself develops. Higher-order learning enables faster learning. Spiral returns to starting point structurally identical but substantively transformed.
end

PASS Integration:
    sutra: "Parts become wholes that become parts of larger wholes; preserve unity beneath differentiation"
    gloss:
        @Integration axiom: Hierarchical nesting. Parts → wholes → meta-wholes. Each level preserves coherence of level beneath. Unity preserved through differentiation.
end

PASS Evolution:
    sutra: "What works today may bind tomorrow; framework must enable its own transcendence"
    gloss:
        @Evolution axiom: Adaptive frameworks transcend themselves. Success can harden into constraint. Framework must explicitly enable own dissolution. Living systems evolve or stagnate.
end

PASS Demonstration:
    sutra: "Claims require evidence; transformation must be visible to others, not only felt internally"
    gloss:
        @Demonstration axiom: Empirical validation required. Internal experience insufficient. Teachability requires demonstrable capacity visible to other practitioners. Evidence > belief.
end

PASS Transmission:
    sutra: "What cannot be taught has not been mastered; teaching capacity validates understanding"
    gloss:
        @Transmission axiom: Teaching = final competency test. Mastery includes capacity to unfold teaching in others. If untransmissible, understanding remains incomplete.
end

PASS TheParadoxTeachings:
    sutra: "Six paradoxes: Effort/Emergence, Control, Self, Framework, Time, Teaching—contradictory yet true"
    gloss:
        Paradox 1 (@Effort): Strive without straining; effort creates conditions; emergence happens or doesn't.
        Paradox 2 (@Control): Take full responsibility for controllable; release attachment to uncontrollable outcomes.
        Paradox 3 (@Self): Self-that-develops ≠ self-that-arrives; work hard on what will be transcended.
        Paradox 4 (@Framework): Take framework completely seriously; do not take it seriously at all.
        Paradox 5 (@Time): No time to waste + nothing to rush toward; both true.
        Paradox 6 (@Teaching): Best teachers make themselves unnecessary; best teachings disappear into student nature.
end

PASS TheDailySutras:
    sutra: "Daily, weekly, monthly, annual inquiry rhythm: state, course, learning, patterns, being, renewal"
    gloss:
        @Daily Sutras structure reflection across multiple timescales.
        Morning: What is my state? What appropriate today? One thing matters most?
        Midday: On course? Adjustment needed? Honoring energy?
        Evening: What learned? What returned to core? Wisdom crystallized?
        Weekly: Chains moved? Attention needed? Patterns?
        Monthly: Different person? Changed? Ready release?
        Annually: Drop everything. What genuinely serves? Rebuild from null.
end

PROC HowToUseThis:
    sutra: "Memorization, contemplation, teaching, crisis recovery—multiple deployment modalities"
    gloss:
        Four usage modes:
        1. Memorization: One principle/week. Write. Speak. Live. Iterate through all thirty.
        2. Contemplation: Open randomly; appearing principle = today's teaching; sit with it.
        3. Teaching: Principles = seeds unfold into hours discourse; let student questions direct growth.
        4. Crisis: When overwhelmed, return here; one principle suffices; begin again.
end

PASS ExternalSourceValidations:
    sutra: "Three external validations confirm principles against independent research and frameworks"
    gloss:
        Three source validations externally anchor principles:
        ARC-AGI (SOURCE-20251024-001): @Demonstration principle validated; claims need evidence.
        Bitter Lesson (SOURCE-20250926-001): @Evolution principle validated; static training binds learning.
        Renaissance 2.0 (SOURCE-20251101-001): @Recursion principle validated; tech amplifies capacity-to-amplify-capacity.
end

PASS ArcagiAndIntelligenceMeasurement:
    sutra: "ARC-AGI benchmark validates evidence-over-belief; performance saturation masks wisdom gaps"
    gloss:
        @ARC-AGI (Chollet, Knoop) benchmark validates @Demonstration principle. Rapid capability evolution (~months not years) demonstrates measurable performance gains. Yet economic value lags; validates distinction between measurable performance and practical wisdom.
end

PASS BitterLessonValidationSource20250926001:
    sutra: "Sutton confirms: general methods leveraging computation most effective; yet static training blocks learning"
    gloss:
        Richard Sutton's meta-analysis: "70 years AI research shows general methods leveraging computation ultimately most effective." Yet: "LLMs trained once, deployed, don't learn from responses." Validates @Evolution principle—static deployment architectures may bind tomorrow's learning.
end

PASS Renaissance20Source20251101001:
    sutra: "Shapiro's civilization vision validates Recursion: technology amplifies capacity to transform technology"
    gloss:
        David Shapiro's Renaissance 2.0 vision: civilizational transformation via AI-enabled human amplification. Validates @Recursion principle: development-that-develops-development. Approaching threshold where tech amplifies capacity-to-transform-tech.
end

PASS VersionHistory:
    sutra: "Version 1.0.0 established December 2025: thirty principles, chain sutras, layer sutras, element sutras"
    gloss:
        @Version 1.0.0 (December 2025): Genesis establishment. Thirty governing principles articulated. Six @Chain Sutras distilled. Eight @Layer Sutras composed. Five @Element Sutras created. Six @Paradox Teachings recorded. Daily Sutras for iterative practice.
end
