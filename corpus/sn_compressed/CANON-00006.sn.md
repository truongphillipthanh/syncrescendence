    sutra: "After 6-12 months Tier 1: add all chains and planetary bodies, transcendence horizon, modal progression, comprehensive evaluation, specialized lunars (1-2 year engagement)."
    gloss:
        **Additional Reading** (~60,000 words):
        11-14. All remaining four chains + planetary bodies (completing Intelligence, Information, Insight, Expertise, Knowledge, Wisdom + Acumen, Coherence, Efficacy, Mastery and their specialized lunars).
        15. @CANON-35100 Transcendence Ring (~10,000 words): Ultimate developmental horizon, civilizational infrastructure, network coordination.
        16. @CANON-00012 Modal Sequence (~10,000 words): Technology-aligned strategic progression (Abstraction→Simulation→Embodiment→Transcendence).
        17. @CANON-00007 Evaluation (~18,000 words): Complete falsification criteria, validation architecture, beta cohort design, founder effect detection, failure modes.
        18. Selected lunars (specialized practices as relevant to needs): @CANON-31110-120 Acumen lunars, @CANON-32110-120 Coherence lunars, @CANON-33110 Efficacy lunar, @CANON-34110-120 Mastery lunars, @CANON-35110 Transcendence lunar.
        
        **Daily Practice**: 40-90 minutes (multi-chain synthesis, recursive amplification recognition).
        
        **Focus**: Synthesizing across chains, recognizing how development in one chain accelerates others, identifying personal recursive amplification patterns.
        
        **Minimum Duration**: 1-2 years before Tier 3 mastery engagement.
        
        **Not yet**: All lunars/satellites simultaneously (overwhelming), both supplements (tactical only after operational mastery), complete Seven-Layer Stack operational deployment.
end

PASS Tier3MasteryContribution:
    sutra: "After 1-2 years Tier 2: add schema navigation, contribution protocols, all specialized systems, both supplements, complete revisitation toward teaching and framework evolution."
    gloss:
        **Additional Reading** (~70,000+ cumulative):
        19. @CANON-00000 Schema (~15,000 words): Complete internalization of dimensional framework, navigation taxonomy, artifact cross-references, terminology precision.
        20. @CANON-00011 Artifact Protocol (~12,000 words): Contribution guidelines, quality standards, peer review, versioning, community role emergence.
        21. All remaining lunars systematically (complete specialized practice exposure across all chains).
        22. All satellites (tactical implementations of lunar systems).
        23. Both operational supplements fully: [[CANON-31110-FEEDCRAFT]]-supplement (Acumen IIC 18,500 words), CANON-00006-supplement (Content Production 28,400 words).
        24. Complete revisitation of all previous documents through mastery lens (pattern recognition, emergent insights, systems-level understanding).
        
        **Daily Practice**: 60-120 minutes (mastery-level synthesis, contribution work, potential teaching/framework evolution).
        
        **Characteristics**: Teaching capability (Degree 5-Transmission), multi-chain fluency at expert level, operational mastery of all systems, contribution to corpus evolution, potential second-generation teacher emergence, leading organizational replication.
        
        **Eternal Practice**: Tier 3 represents ongoing mastery development, not endpoint. Continuous revisitation with deepening understanding. Contribution to framework evolution ongoing.
