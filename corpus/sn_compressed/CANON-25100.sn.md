# Κ-25100: Context Transition Protocol (SN)

PROC Canon25100ContextTransitionProtocol:
    sutra: "Unified interface for cognitive continuity across sessions via three adaptive modes."
    gloss:
        @term Context Transition Protocol: Single interface enabling AI-mediated determination of optimal handling (culmination, continuation, compression) based on context analysis. Principal maintains strategic sovereignty; AI determines operational execution.
        
        Design principle: Terminal architecture thesis establishes AI mediates complexity. Practitioner invokes protocol; system analyzes context and produces appropriate output.
        
        Constitutional relationship: Operates at session boundaries. Produces artifacts optimized for transition type: hybrid cases supported (e.g., culmination + continuation).
end

PASS UnifiedInterfaceForCognitive:
    sutra: "Single command triggers multi-mode analysis and artifact generation."
    gloss:
        Principal invocation options: "Handle context transition", "Close this session", "Continue from [prior work]", "Context is getting long—compress", or implicit triggers (capacity > 80%, natural conclusion, extended temporal gap).
        
        System response: (1) analyze context state, (2) determine mode(s), (3) generate artifact(s), (4) present for review.
        
        Practitioner does not select mode; AI does.
end

PASS PartIConstitutionalFoundation:
    sutra: "Protocol establishes session continuity without operational micromanagement."
    gloss:
        Core thesis: context transitions = single category with multiple modes. Protocol operates at session boundaries, mid-stream (if capacity constrained), and handles hybrid cases.
        
        Relationship to @term Terminal Architecture: AI functions as librarian determining cognitive state restoration needs.
end

PASS APurposeStatement:

PASS PartViiiFutureEvolution:
    sutra: "Anticipated enhancements, MCP integration path, success metrics."
    gloss:
        Enhancements: auto-injection (CLI loads artifacts automatically), semantic linking (by topic not time), cross-platform sync (portable across AI systems), proactive transitions (AI initiates before limits).
        
        @term MCP integration: transition artifacts as MCP resources, cross-platform injection via MCP, standardized format across platforms.
        
        Metrics: time-to-productivity after start, context restoration completeness (follow-up questions needed), compression ratio vs. fidelity maintained, canonical graduation rate.

    gloss:
        Auto-injection: CLI tools automatically load relevant transition artifacts at session start.
        
        Semantic linking: transition artifacts linked by topic/theme, not just chronological time.
        
        Cross-platform sync: transition artifacts portable across AI platforms with minimal adaptation.
        
        Proactive transitions: AI initiates transitions before capacity limits reached (predictive).

PASS BMcpIntegrationPath:
    sutra: "Model Context Protocol integration enabling standardized cross-platform transitions."

        When MCP achieves universality: transition artifacts exposed as MCP resources, cross-platform context injection via MCP, standardized transition format across platforms.
        
        Enables: any MCP-compatible platform to consume transition artifacts natively.
end

PASS CMeasurement:
    sutra: "Four quantitative metrics evaluating transition protocol effectiveness."
    gloss:
        Time-to-productivity: seconds elapsed from session start to productive engagement (compare baseline vs. with/without transition artifact).
        
        Context restoration completeness: follow-up clarification questions needed (lower = better artifact).
        
        Compression ratio achieved vs. semantic fidelity: tokens reduced vs. quality maintained (track correlation).
        
        Canonical graduation rate: artifacts promoted to corpus (indicator of protocol-driven framework evolution).

PROC PartIxOraclePedigree:
    sutra: "Decision archaeology and multi-model coordination history for repository-centric workflows."
    gloss:
        Purpose: track historical lineage (Oracle 0 → current), document decisions and rationale, integrate across platforms.
        
        Distinguishes from handoff: handoff for session init (push context), pedigree for decision archaeology (pull context), multi-model coordination, long-term analysis.
        
        Components: thread_id, campaign, phase, date; decisions (id, principal words, interpretation, lenses applied, score, outcome); artifacts produced; handoff state (open threads, blockers, ready).
        
        Locations: summaries (ARCH-ORACLE_ARC_SUMMARY.md), decisions (ARCH-ORACLE_DECISIONS.md), intentions (ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md), execution (EXECUTION_LOG-*.md).
        
        Cross-platform: tracks decisions across Claude (Oracle/Alpha/Beta), Gemini, ChatGPT with platform-specific implications and verification checklist.

PASS APurpose:
    sutra: "Oracle pedigree tracks decision archaeology and multi-model coordination."
    gloss:
        Lineage tracking: Oracle 0 → current thread; enables historical understanding.
        
        Decision archaeology: what was decided, why, across what lenses, what was outcome.
        
        Multi-model integration: decisions tracked across platforms (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT), not just single system.
        
        Repository-centric: pulls context via pedigree metadata rather than pushing via handoff documents.
end

PASS BPedigreeVsHandoff:
    sutra: "Complementary mechanisms: handoff for continuity, pedigree for archaeology."
    gloss:
        Handoff documents: useful for session init prompts, context restoration across model resets, cross-platform sync (push context).
        
        @term Oracle Pedigree: supersedes handoff for decision archaeology (pull context), multi-model coordination history, repository workflows, long-term pattern analysis.
        
        Relationship: both can coexist; serve different functions.
