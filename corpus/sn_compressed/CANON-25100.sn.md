# Κ-25100: Context Transition Protocol (SN)

PROC Canon25100ContextTransitionProtocol:
    sutra: "Unified interface for cognitive continuity managing mode selection across session boundaries."
    gloss:
        @Context Transition Protocol: Manages cognitive continuity at session boundaries via automatic mode selection. Principal invokes once; AI determines mode(s) and generates appropriate artifact.
        
        Core function: Analyze context state → determine mode(s) → generate unified transition artifact.
        
        Principal command: Any of "Handle context transition," "Close this session," "Continue from [work]," "Compress context," or implicit triggers (>80% capacity, natural conclusion, temporal gap).
        
        System response: Analyze context → determine mode(s) → generate artifact → present for review.
        
        Relationship to @Terminal Architecture: AI mediates complexity. Practitioner maintains strategic sovereignty without operational micromanagement.
end

PASS PartIConstitutionalFoundation:
    sutra: "Protocol establishes single unified interface replacing multiple separate transition protocols."
    gloss:
        Purpose: Establish unified interface for managing cognitive continuity across sessions, threads, platforms. Single interface with AI-determined optimal handling based on context analysis.
        
        Relationship to @Terminal Architecture (Editorial thread Dec 2025): AI mediates; practitioner doesn't choose between culmination/continuation/compression. System analyzes and produces appropriate output.
        
        Design principle: Context transitions are single category with multiple modes. AI is librarian determining what's needed.
end

PASS PartIiContextAnalysis:
    sutra: "State variables guide automatic mode selection via context analysis framework."
    gloss:
        @State Variables assessed: Position (thread start/mid/end), Capacity (% window used), Value Density (insights generated), Continuation Need (will work resume), Temporal Gap (time since last session), Complexity (handoff richness).
        
        Mode Selection Logic:
        - IF thread ending OR explicit close: INCLUDE culmination_mode if significant insights; INCLUDE continuation_mode if work resumes
        - IF context > 70% capacity AND thread continuing: INCLUDE compression_mode
        - IF thread starting AND prior context exists: INCLUDE continuation_mode as injection
        
        GENERATE composite_artifact(selected_modes)
end

TERM CModeDefinitions:
    sutra: "Three modes addressing distinct transition functions: culmination, continuation, compression."
    gloss:
        @Culmination Mode: Trigger: thread ending with value. Output: captured insights, canonical candidates, historical record. Question: What was learned? What persists?
        
        @Continuation Mode: Trigger: thread boundary where work resumes. Output: state restoration, entry points, prerequisite context. Question: What state must be restored? Entry point?
        
        @Compression Mode: Trigger: context approaching limits mid-stream. Output: preserved essentials, regeneration guides. Question: What survives? What regenerates?
        
        @Transition Artifact: Unified adaptive template with sections activated based on selected modes. Always includes: Context State Summary, Next Actions. Conditionally includes: Synthesis (culmination), Continuation State (continuation), Compression (compression).
end

PASS PartIiiTheTransition:
    sutra: "Unified artifact structure with mode-specific sections adapted to transition type."
    gloss:
        @Unified Structure: Single adaptive template. Always included: Context State Summary, Next Actions. Mode-conditional sections:
        
        SYNTHESIS [Culmination Mode]: Trajectory (work evolution), Key Insights (elaboration + implication), Canonical Candidates (proposed location/status), Unresolved Questions.
        
        CONTINUATION STATE [Continuation Mode]: Essential Context (minimum viable state), Entry Point (framing for resumption), Resource Pointers (corpus/artifact links).
        
        COMPRESSION [Compression Mode]: Compressed State (single paragraph), Preserved Elements (critical items), Regeneration Guide (expand pointers), Discarded Elements (audit trail).
        
        Mode Interaction Patterns: End + resume = Culmination + Continuation (full synthesis + entry point); Mid-work capacity limit = Compression (compressed state + regeneration); New session on prior work = Continuation consumption (entry point as injection); Conclusion only = Culmination only; Quick checkpoint = Continuation only.
        
        Quality Criteria: Stands alone (readable without original), mode-appropriate (relevant sections only), actionable (clear next steps), auditable (preserved/discarded documented), efficient (no empty sections).
end

PASS PartIvCliIntegration:
    sutra: "CLI integration enables explicit invocation and implicit triggering with file system/git persistence."
    gloss:
        @Command Interface: Explicit: "Handle context transition" (any variant). Implicit triggers: Context > 80% capacity, natural conclusion detected, extended silence detected.
        
        Context injection at session start: load prior transition artifact as continuation context via CLI flag.
        
        @File System Integration: Default locations: ~/syncrescendence/context/{active, archive, templates}, corpus/. Workflow: AI generates → save to active/ → on close move to archive/ with timestamp → on new session load relevant archived artifacts.
        
        @Git Integration: Artifacts version-controlled. Enables time-travel through cognitive states. Query history: git log context/archive/, git diff across transitions.
end

PASS PartVCrossiicApplication:
    sutra: "Per-IIC profiles customize artifact emphasis; cross-IIC handoff via metadata-enhanced continuation."
    gloss:
        @Per-IIC Transition Profiles: Acumen = Compression-heavy (signal qualification, pattern alerts); Coherence = Culmination-heavy (framework synthesis); Efficacy = Continuation-heavy (task state, procedure); Mastery = Culmination + archival (pedagogical); Transcendence = Full composite (strategic synthesis).
        
        @Cross-IIC Handoff: Source IIC generates transition artifact with continuation mode framed for target's function. Principal transfers via file system or copy/paste. Target receives context injection calibrated to its cognitive personality.
        
        Handoff Metadata addendum: Source, Target, rationale, target task, translation notes for target's mode.
end

PROC ASessionLifecycleWith:
    sutra: "Session lifecycle: inject context → work with analysis → compress if needed → close with artifact → archive."
    gloss:
        Session Start: INJECT prior transition artifact (continuation mode) into context.
        
        Work Session: WORK with ongoing context analysis. IF capacity > 70%: COMPRESS mid-session (compression mode).
        
        Session Close: CLOSE with end-session transition (culmination + continuation as appropriate).
        
        Archive: STORE artifact, git commit.
        
        Triggers: Automatic (>80% capacity, natural conclusion, extended gap, significant insight). Explicit (principal requests "close," "checkpoint," "switch IIC," "prepare continuation"). Principal can override (skip synthesis, compress more, include specific elements).
end

PASS BAutomaticVsExplicit:
    sutra: "Automatic triggers detect session endpoints; explicit triggers enable principal control."
    gloss:
        @Automatic Triggers (AI detects and offers): Context utilization > 80%, natural conclusion detected (goal/question resolved), extended conversation gap (likely ending), significant insight generated (worth capturing).
        
        @Explicit Triggers (Principal requests): "Let's close this session," "Checkpoint here," "Switch to [other IIC]," "Prepare continuation for later."
        
        Principal Override: AI proposes; principal disposes. Options: culmination only, skip synthesis, aggressive compression, preserve specific elements.
end

PASS CPrincipalOverride:
    sutra: "Principal retains sovereign control over transition execution and artifact content."
    gloss:
        Override options available: "Just culmination, I won't continue this," "Skip synthesis, only continuation context," "Compress more aggressively," "Include [specific element] I need preserved."
        
        Design principle: AI proposes mode and structure; principal approves, modifies, or rejects.
end

PASS PartViiDistillationInterface:
    sutra: "Transition artifacts graduate to corpus; forgetting interface enables hygiene."
    gloss:
        @Distillation Interface: Transition Artifact (Fluid) → Canonical Candidate (principal review) → Stable across 3+ sessions → New/revised canonical document → Propagated to all IICs.
        
        Graduation Criteria: Insight proven stable across 3+ sessions, represents framework evolution (not task-specific), fills corpus gap, aligns with constitutional principles, principal approves.
        
        Forgetting: Archive (default: keep for reference), Prune (low-value deletable), Merge (consolidate related), Graduate (insights to canonical). Monthly hygiene: review, prune, consolidate.
end

PASS PartViiiFutureEvolution:
    sutra: "Enhanced CLI auto-injection, MCP portability, cross-platform semantic linking anticipated."
    gloss:
        Anticipated Enhancements: Auto-injection of relevant artifacts, semantic linking by topic, cross-platform portability, proactive transitions before capacity limits.
        
        MCP Integration Path: Transitions as MCP resources, cross-platform injection via MCP, standardized format across platforms.
        
        Success Metrics: Time to productive state post-session, context restoration completeness (follow-up questions needed), compression ratio vs. semantic fidelity, canonical graduation rate.
end

PROC PartIxOraclePedigree:
    sutra: "Oracle Pedigree tracks decision archaeology, multi-model integration, repository-centric lineage."
    gloss:
        @Oracle Pedigree Protocol: Provides historical lineage (Oracle 0 → current), decision archaeology (what decided/why), multi-model integration tracking.
        
        Purpose: As work moves repository-centric, pedigree supersedes handoff for decision archaeology, multi-model coordination history, long-term pattern analysis.
        
        @Handoff Artifacts retain use for: Session initialization, context restoration across model resets, cross-platform sync (push context).
        
        @Oracle Pedigree supersedes handoff for: Decision archaeology (pull), multi-model history, repository workflows, pattern analysis.
        
        Pedigree Components per session: thread_id, campaign, phase, date, decisions (id, principal_words, interpretation, lenses_applied, score, outcome), artifacts_produced, handoff_state (open threads, blockers, readiness).
        
        @Pedigree Location: Distributed across ARCH-ORACLE_ARC_SUMMARY.md (lineage), ARCH-ORACLE_DECISIONS.md (archaeology), ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md (active intentions), EXECUTION_LOG-*.md (implementation).
        
        @Cross-IIC Handoff: Captures platforms involved, decision point, principal's words, platform-specific implications (role/action per platform), verification checklist.
        
        Maintenance: During session capture principal's words verbatim, document interpretation, record 18-lens evaluation if strategic, note artifacts. Post-session update summaries, decisions, intentions, commit with pedigree reference. Across sessions pedigree enables any Oracle to understand full history; pattern analysis reveals themes; anti-patterns visible.
end

PASS AppendixAQuickReference:
    sutra: "Templates for minimal, standard, and cross-IIC transitions with mode-specific sections."
    gloss:
        @Minimal Transition (Light Touch): State: [one sentence]. Key point: [most important]. Resume with: "[exact prompt]".
        
        @Standard Transition (Most Sessions): Modes: [active]. State: [2-3 sentences]. Insights if culminating: [1+ key insight]. Continuation if resuming: Entry point + context needed list. Next: [action list].
        
        @Handoff Transition (Cross-IIC): Topic, For target, Context compressed, Entry prompt for target.
end

PROC AppendixBMigrationFrom:
    sutra: "Existing separate protocols remain valid; unified interface applies going forward."
    gloss:
        Existing culmination, continuation, compression artifacts remain valid. Going forward use unified interface; system produces needed combination.
        
        Prior artifacts loadable as continuation context—serve same function.
