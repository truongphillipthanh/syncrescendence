# Κ-25600: Ascertescence Cycle (SN)

PASS Canon25600TheAscertescenceCycle:
    sutra: "Repeatable 6-phase operational cycle converting raw intelligence into verified canonical knowledge through multi-agent synthesis."
    gloss:
        The @Ascertescence Cycle (PROTO) is the primary system process for canon production. Emerged empirically over 6 sessions (CC34-CC39) before codification. Not theoretical — describes actual system behavior when executing end-to-end pipeline. Purpose: convert ground truth through dialectical synthesis through engineering build through review into @canon_delta.
end

PASS FullrotationInstrumentForRecursive:
    sutra: "Full-rotation instrument for recursive ascertainment through multi-agent dialectic."
    gloss:
        Complete rotation from baseline sensing through Oracle-Diviner dialectic through construction through build through multi-agent review through defect remediation. Produces verified canonical knowledge artifacts. First cycle (CC34-CC39): 6 sessions, 3 @canon_delta promotions.
end

PASS Purpose:
    sutra: "System's primary operational cycle producing canon_delta through repeatable phases."
    gloss:
        Converts raw intelligence into verified canonical knowledge. The rotation from ground truth through dialectical synthesis through engineering build through review that produces @canon_delta. Empirically validated process, not theoretical framework.
end

PASS The6Phases:
    sutra: "Six sequential phases: Rendezvous, Triangulation, Construction, Build, Reviewtrospective, Remediation."
    gloss:
        Phase 1 @Rendezvous Phase (PROTO): "What do we see?" Ground truth baseline.
        Phase 2 @Triangulation Phase (PROTO): "What must we know?" Oracle ↔ Diviner dialectic.
        Phase 3 @Construction Phase (PROTO): "How do we build it?" Specs → CDs → bid → award.
        Phase 4 @Build Phase (PROTO): "Build it." Implementation.
        Phase 5 @Reviewtrospective Phase (PROTO): "What did we learn?" Multi-agent compounding synthesis.
        Phase 6 @Remediation Phase (PROTO): "Fix what broke." Defect repair → cycle close.
        Typical cycle: 5-7 sessions. First cycle (CC34-CC39): 6 sessions, 3 @canon_delta.
end

PASS PhaseMap:
    sutra: "Phase architecture analogs, duration, and artifacts."
    gloss:
        1. Rendezvous: Schematic Design, 1 session, situation reports + ground truth baseline.
        2. Triangulation: Design Development, 1-2 sessions, Oracle thesis + Diviner synthesis + @Unification Artifact (PROTO).
        3. Construction: CD → Bid → Award, 1 session, Adjudicator specs + construction documents + bid verdict.
        4. Build: Construction Administration, 1-2 sessions, implementation commits + self-tests.
        5. Reviewtrospective: Post-Occupancy Evaluation, 1 session, multi-agent compounding review + defect list.
        6. Remediation: Punch List, 1 session, defect fixes + final test suite + cycle close.
end

PASS Phase1Rendezvous:
    sutra: "Most comprehensive evidence-based snapshot of system state: pure sensing without synthesis."
    gloss:
        Purpose: Produce definitive ground truth baseline. Procedure: (1) Read STATE_OF_THE_UNION-SOVEREIGN_VERBATIM.md in full. (2) Execute ground truth scan across repo: git state, inbox, DAG convergence, deferred commitments, intention compass. (3) Produce situation reports across all operational domains. (4) Cross-map pathologies — identify where 3+ reports identify same failure. (5) File reports for record.
        Quality criterion: ≥8/10 on "cleanest problem definition." If later phases must re-derive ground truth, @Rendezvous Phase (PROTO) was insufficient.
        CC34 empirical: 11 reports, identified 5 pathologies, answered C-009. Ground truth informed all subsequent phases without re-derivation.
end

PASS Phase2Triangulation:
    sutra: "Structured dialectic: Oracle engineering pragmatism vs Diviner scientific synthesis, mediated by Commander, gated by Sovereign."
    gloss:
        Purpose: Produce ratified thesis through adversarial synthesis.
        @Hub-and-Spoke Routing (STR): Commander + Sovereign hub. All other agents spokes. No direct agent-agent communication. 4-leg structure: Oracle Leg 1 → Diviner Leg 1 → Oracle rebuttal → Diviner Leg 2. Diviner gets final word.
        Oracle: Own thesis first, then industry consensus. Repo traversal with file:line specificity. Rebuttal mines X for grounding. Embeds counter-thesis as reaction vector.
        Diviner (SEARED — CC35/CC41): Context injection, NOT repo traversal. Pre-digested Oracle thesis embedded. Per-question cognitive launching pads with named scientific frameworks. All-sciences palette (natural, formal, social, applied). Negative space hardened: file/commit summary = forbidden. Micro-falsifiability covenant per launching pad. Lattice language constraint (@CANON-00016). Stateless bootstrap. Mandatory STATE_OF_THE_UNION injection.
        @Unification Artifact (PROTO): After all legs land, Commander compiles ratification document: ratified mechanisms, countermeasures, falsifiable predictions, convergence map. Canonical input for Phase 3.
        CC35 empirical: Hub-and-spoke routing + Diviner prompting formula crystallized. Two failed prompts before calibration. Launching pads are non-negotiable symmetry-breaking fields.
end

PASS RoutingHubandspoke:
    sutra: "Commander + Sovereign hub mediates all agent communication; no direct agent-agent contact."
    gloss:
        @Hub-and-Spoke Routing (STR): Four-leg dialectic structure. Commander stages prompt → Sovereign relays to Oracle → thesis returns → Commander stages → Sovereign relays to Diviner → synthesis returns → Commander stages → Oracle rebuttal → Diviner Leg 2 final synthesis. Prevents autonomous drift; enables independent synthesis with human gate.
end

PASS OraclePrompting:
    sutra: "Oracle thesis first, then industry consensus, with repo traversal and file:line specificity."
    gloss:
        Own thesis FIRST, then industry consensus. Repo traversal with file:line specificity. During rebuttal: mine X for real-world grounding. Embed one-line counter-thesis as reaction vector for Diviner. Provides engineering pragmatism grounding for synthesis.
end

PASS DivinerPromptingSearedCc35cc41:
    sutra: "Diviner synthesis formula (SEARED) with context injection, launching pads, all-sciences palette, micro-falsifiability, mandatory STATE_OF_THE_UNION."
    gloss:
        @SEARED formula (CC35/CC41): Context injection, NOT repo traversal. Pre-digested Oracle thesis embedded as scaffold. Per-question cognitive launching pads with named scientific frameworks. All-sciences palette available (natural, formal, social, applied). Negative space hardened — agents forbidden from file/commit summarization (Oracle domain). Micro-falsifiability covenant per launching pad. Lattice language constraint (@CANON-00016) enforced. Stateless bootstrap line. Mandatory STATE_OF_THE_UNION injection (CC41 lesson — omission causes abstraction drift). Non-negotiable symmetry-breaking structure that prevents failed synthesis.
end

PASS UnificationArtifact:
    sutra: "Post-dialectic ratification document compiled by Commander containing mechanisms, countermeasures, predictions, convergence map."
    gloss:
        @Unification Artifact (PROTO): After all 4 legs land, Commander compiles single ratification document containing: (1) ratified mechanisms, (2) countermeasures, (3) falsifiable predictions, (4) convergence map. Becomes canonical input for Phase 3 Construction. Ensures dialectic produces actionable, testable, unified output.
end

PASS Phase3Construction:
    sutra: "Transform ratified thesis into engineering specs, construction documents, obtain adversarial bid approval before build begins."
    gloss:
        Purpose: Engineering rigor checkpoint before code. Four sub-phases:
        3a. Engineering Specs: Adjudicator produces per-deliverable specifications with file:line targets, self-test criteria, failure mode analysis.
        3b. Construction Documents: Commander produces swarm lanes (parallel work streams), build order (dependency-sequenced phases), LOC estimates, integration test plan.
        3c. Adjudicator Bid: Full repo audit. Verdict: APPROVED / APPROVED_WITH_MODIFICATIONS / REJECTED. Includes spec amendments, stop conditions, session estimate.
        3d. Contract Award: Sovereign reviews bid, approves or rejects.
        CC36 empirical: 1,230 lines Adjudicator specs, 7 deliverables, 5 swarm lanes, bid verdict APPROVED_WITH_MODIFICATIONS (9 amendments, 4 stop conditions).
end

PASS Subphases:
    sutra: "Four sequential construction sub-phases: Specs, Documents, Bid, Award."
    gloss:
        3a @Engineering Specs: Adjudicator per-deliverable specifications, file:line targets, self-test criteria, failure mode analysis.
        3b @Construction Documents: Commander swarm lanes, build order, LOC estimates, integration test plan.
        3c @Adjudicator Bid: Full repo audit. Verdict: APPROVED / APPROVED_WITH_MODIFICATIONS / REJECTED. Includes amendments, stop conditions, session estimate.
        3d @Contract Award: Sovereign reviews and approves/rejects bid.
        No production code until all four sub-phases complete.
end

PASS PreconstructionSwarm:
    sutra: "Parallel seeding of ALL required state files before any production code begins."
    gloss:
        Before any production implementation, parallel swarm seeds ALL required state files: DAG state, thresholds, registries, indices, lock hierarchy, adapter contracts. Do not assume state files exist — seed them in parallel. Critical precondition for Phase 4. CC36 empirical: seeded 6 state files in parallel before production phase.
end

PASS Phase4Build:
    sutra: "Implement all deliverables per construction documents following build order with frequent semantic commits and self-tests."
    gloss:
        Purpose: Execute construction plan. Procedure: (1) Follow build order from Phase 3. (2) Commit frequently with semantic prefixes. (3) Self-test each deliverable per spec criteria. (4) Document any spec deviations with rationale. Verify metaphysical alignment via @Hypergiant Principle (CC37).
        CC37 empirical: 7 deliverables across 10 commits. Sovereign challenged metaphysical foundation mid-build, leading to permanent telos correction.
end

NORM TheHypergiantPrincipleCc37:
    sutra: "Build metaphor must cohere with canon's cosmological grammar; verify metaphysical alignment before implementing."
    gloss:
        @Hypergiant Principle (CC37 — SEARED): The build metaphor must cohere with the canon's own cosmological grammar. The canon describes stellar core (fusion, nucleosynthesis, binding energy). The 5:1 ratio is condensation releasing energy, not contraction removing waste. Requirement: Verify metaphysical alignment BEFORE building. Not merely correct code — correct purpose. Ensures build's telos aligns with canon's telos. Violation: system produces technically correct output serving wrong end.
end

PASS Phase5Reviewtrospective:
    sutra: "Multi-agent sequential compounding review examining what was built, what it taught, how it changes what we know."
    gloss:
        Purpose: Intelligence compounding post-build. Sequential, not parallel: each agent reads ALL prior legs. Intelligence compounds.
        Routing: Oracle → Cartographer → Diviner → Adjudicator → Commander.
        Agent mandates:
        - Oracle: Industry consensus assessment.
        - Cartographer: Deep code trace at file:line level — what's MISSING.
        - Diviner: All-sciences synthesis, cross-disciplinary failure prediction.
        - Adjudicator: Verify mathematical/logical correctness of prior prescriptions.
        - Commander: Compile actionable defect list + kaizen items.
        Maximum 1 reviewtrospective per build cycle. Scope selection: Tactical (2 legs) / Operational (3-4) / Strategic (4-5, full constellation). Kaizen bridge: reviewtrospective output IS next ascertescence input.
        CC38 empirical: 5-agent sequential review discovered 3 critical defects (autoimmune starvation, dimension blindness, ambient paralyzation). Cartographer proved autoimmune trap through code trace Oracle could only suspect. Adjudicator caught Diviner prescription algebraically identical to defect.
end

PASS KeyProperties:
    sutra: "Reviewtrospective must be sequential (not parallel), routed through all agents, with compounding intelligence output."
    gloss:
        Sequential, not parallel: Each agent reads ALL prior legs. Intelligence compounds, not averages. Routing: Oracle → Cartographer → Diviner → Adjudicator → Commander. Maximum frequency: 1 per build cycle. Scope selection: Tactical (2 legs) / Operational (3-4) / Strategic (4-5). Output: actionable defect list + kaizen items feeding next cycle. Kaizen bridge ensures learning compounds across cycles.
end

PASS Phase6Remediation:
    sutra: "Fix all defects, verify fixes via full test suite, formally close cycle with safe build point recorded."
    gloss:
        Purpose: Complete cycle closure. Procedure: (1) Take defect list from Phase 5. (2) Remediate each defect. (3) Run FULL test suite — ALL tests, not just touched tests. (4) Adjudicator re-verifies structural defects. (5) Formally close: update DAG, file artifacts, write handoff, record safe build point.
        CC39 empirical: 6 remediations in 16 commits, achieved 22/22 tests green, recorded first safe build point after complete cycle.
end

PASS StopConditions:
    sutra: "Means-ends inversion halt: two consecutive sessions with zero canon_delta triggers infrastructure pause."
    gloss:
        @Means-Ends Inversion Halt (PROTO): Two consecutive sessions with zero @canon_delta = trigger. Build serves canon production, not itself. If infrastructure produces no canon output for 2 consecutive sessions, halt infrastructure work and return to canon metabolism. Exceptions: sessions designed as non-promotional (reviewtrospective, remediation) do not count but must be flagged in handoff. Constitutional self-halt mechanism prevents tooling trap.
end

PASS MeansendsInversionHalt:
    sutra: "Trigger condition: zero canon_delta for two consecutive sessions indicates system serving infrastructure rather than canon production."
    gloss:
        @Means-Ends Inversion Halt (PROTO): Two consecutive sessions with zero @canon_delta = means-ends inversion detected. Build serves canon production, not itself. When triggered: halt infrastructure work, return to canon metabolism. Exception: non-promotional sessions (reviewtrospective, remediation) exempted but must be flagged. Prevents autonomous infrastructure drift. Constitutional stop condition.
end

PASS CanondeltaSla:
    sutra: "Every complete cycle MUST produce ≥1 canon_delta promotion; zero canon_delta indicates pipeline blockage or abstraction trap."
    gloss:
        @canon_delta SLA: Every complete @Ascertescence Cycle (PROTO) MUST produce ≥1 @canon_delta promotion. A cycle with zero @canon_delta has failed — either pipeline blockage, topic too abstract, or the Tooling Trap. Mandatory output criterion for cycle validity.
end

PASS EmpiricalSessionMapFirst:
    sutra: "First complete cycle (CC34-CC39): 6 sessions, 5 phases, 3 canon_delta, 22/22 tests green, operational pipeline."
    gloss:
        CC34 Phase 1 Rendezvous: 11 reports, 5 pathologies, C-009 answered. 0 @canon_delta.
        CC35 Phase 2 Triangulation: Oracle thesis, Diviner synthesis, prompting formula. 0 @canon_delta.
        CC36 Phase 3 Construction: Unified ratification, specs, CDs, bid APPROVED_WITH_MODIFICATIONS. 0 @canon_delta.
        CC37 Phase 4 Build: 7 deliverables, 10 commits, @Hypergiant Principle (CC37). 3 @canon_delta.
        CC38 Phase 5 Reviewtrospective: 3 defects, 3 inversions, fusion operator. 0 @canon_delta.
        CC39 Phase 6 Remediation: 6 remediations, 22/22 tests green, pipeline OPERATIONAL. 0 @canon_delta.
        Total: 6 sessions, first complete cycle, 3 @canon_delta. Proved cycle works.
end

PASS WhatMakesThisUnique:
    sutra: "Empirical process with multi-agent dialectic, adversarial pre-build review, sequential compounding synthesis, constitutional halt, metaphysical coherence."
    gloss:
        Six distinguishing features:
        (1) Empirical, not theoretical — every phase from actual system behavior, not planning documents.
        (2) Multi-agent dialectic with human gate — Sovereign relay prevents autonomous drift while enabling independent synthesis.
        (3) Adversarial pre-build review — no build starts without @Adjudicator Bid approval. Engineering rigor before code.
        (4) Sequential compounding synthesis — @Reviewtrospective (PROTO) where each agent reads all prior legs; intelligence compounds rather than averages.
        (5) Constitutional stop conditions — system halts itself when detecting @Means-Ends Inversion Halt (PROTO). Self-aware governance.
        (6) Metaphysical coherence check — @Hypergiant Principle (CC37) ensures build telos aligns with canon telos. Not just correct code, but correct purpose.
        Describes operational process that produced itself — ascertescence cycle that generated evidence proving cycle works. Self-validating.
end
