end

PASS DailyPracticesEnergyadapted:
    sutra: "Energy-state-aware reconnaissance, synthesis, and articulation rhythm adapts capacity to perceptual work demands."
    gloss:
        Three-phase daily practice: reconnaissance (signal collection), synthesis (pattern integration), articulation (platform contribution). Adjusts across four capacity states. Peak state emphasizes all three phases fully. Baseline simplifies. Depletion maintains minimal continuity. Crisis suspends work entirely.

Resolution: @Automated Stream (80%)—curated subscriptions (YouTube, Substack, Twitter lists), AI pre-screening, systematic Priority Band qualification, strategic notifications. @Serendipitous Stream (20%)—Friday horizon scanning 2-3hr, browse recommendations, explore tangents, discover new sources. Serendipity protocol: capture valuable discoveries, add to automated stream, monthly assessment of serendipity value. Why: algorithms optimize engagement not intellectual development; filter bubbles miss paradigm shifts; innovation from unexpected connections. Balance check: if no serendipitous value in 3 months, increase exploration time.
end

PASS EFeedCurationFourdimensional:
