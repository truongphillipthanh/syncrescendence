PASS ChainCorrespondenceSensingInformation:
    sutra: "Acumen corresponds to the Information Chain, synchronizing its stage progression with chain levels."
    gloss:
        @Planetary Acumen corresponds to the `Information Chain`, specializing in sensing development, signal detection, and pattern recognition. Its `@Four-Stage Architecture` synchronizes with Information Chain levels: Stage 1 = Level 1-Initial, Stage 2 = Level 2-Intermediate, Stage 3 = Level 3-Advanced, Stage 4 = Level 4-Mastery.
end

PASS RelationshipToCausalChain:
    sutra: "Acumen synchronizes with the Information Chain's stages and has dependencies on and synergy with other chains."
    gloss:
        @Planetary Acumen aligns with the `Information Chain`; its stages (1-4) directly match the Chain's levels (1-Initial to 4-Mastery) for pattern recognition, signal extraction, intuitive discrimination, and embodied knowing.
        Cross-Chain Dependencies: @Intelligence Chain for infrastructure, @Insight Chain for interpretation (via @Acumen → @Coherence handoff), @Expertise Chain for action, @Knowledge Chain for curriculum, and @Wisdom Chain for purpose alignment.

PASS RecursiveImprovement:
    sutra: "Recursive improvement uses quarterly self-assessment and evolution triggers for continuous Acumen refinement."
    gloss:
        @Acumen's `@Recursive Improvement` process involves `Quarterly Self-Assessment` and `Evolution Triggers`. Self-assessments check perceptual acuity, platform metrics, prediction accuracy, attention optimization, domain exploration balance, @Acumen IIC compartmentalization, @Seven-Layer Technosphere Stack effectiveness, and `dual-stream intelligence` balance. Evolution triggers (e.g., declining accuracy, platform stagnation, @Acumen IIC fragmentation, stack friction) prompt bias correction, strategy revision, boundary strengthening, or configuration adjustments.
end

PASS SelfassessmentQuarterly:
    sutra: "Quarterly self-assessments verify perceptual acuity, platform metrics, and Acumen IIC functionality."
    gloss:
        `Self-Assessment (Quarterly)` for @Acumen involves verifying:
        1. Perceptual acuity improvement.
