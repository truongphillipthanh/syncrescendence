# Κ-24000: Omni-Quality Cultivation (SN)

PASS Canon24000Priority5Omniquality:
    sutra: "Four-dimensional progressive approximation framework for comprehensive goodness across ethics, knowledge, capability, and presence."
    gloss:
        @Omni-Quality Cultivation: Capacity to serve all stakeholders while integrating knowledge, generating volitional effectiveness, and maintaining conscious presence across temporal-spatial-dimensional scales. Lattice tier, parent CANON-20000. Structured as four progressive omni-qualities, each with stage-gated development.
end

PASS ProgressiveApproachArchitecture:
    sutra: "Progressive approximation by orthogonal scale, level, degree, and stage dimensions, tracked via practitioner self-assessment."
    gloss:
        Scale [1-4] tracks practitioner sophistication (Micro/Meso/Macro/Omni). Level [1-5] tracks sequential causal-chain advancement (prerequisite-dependent). Degree [1-5] applies to Coherence/Transcendence chains only (lunar mastery). Stage [1-5] tracks organizational maturity. Phase tracks chronological business progression. Assessment includes external validation, not self-report only.
end

PASS FrameworkIntegration:
    sutra: "Omni-Quality integrates four cultivation domains with six causal chains and three integration dimensions."
    gloss:
        Omni-Quality encompasses @Omnibenevolence Cultivation, @Omniscience Cultivation, @Omnipotence Cultivation, @Omnipresence Cultivation. Omnipotence spans six causal chains: Technology, Sensing, Coherence, Efficacy, Embodiment, Transcendence. Omnipresence spans @Temporal Integration, @Spatial Integration, @Dimensional Integration (Cognitive Palace layers 1-7).
end

PASS OrthogonalDimensionsApplied:
    sutra: "Two progression models: Synchronization (balanced all-chain development) vs. Specialization (focus-chain depth with baseline maintenance)."
    gloss:
        Synchronization: Best for neurotypical/generalists, develop all chains Level 2+ simultaneously. Specialization: Best for neurodivergent/specialists, advance 2-3 chains Level 3+ while maintaining Level 1 baseline in others. Both require Technology chain prioritized (enables others). Advancement requires external validation, not self-assessment alone.
end

PASS CelestialNavigation:
    sutra: "CANON-24000 orbits CANON-20000 (Cognitive Palace) lattice; siblings include Dimensional Coordinators (20010), Meta-Systems (20020), Chain Matrix (21000), Interference Dynamics (22000), Lunar Navigation (23000), Memory Architecture (25000)."
    gloss:
        Parent: CANON-20000-PALACE-lattice. Independent progression develops at own pace. All siblings lattice-tier, supporting omni-quality development through complementary frameworks.

    gloss:
        @Omniscience Cultivation = foundation knowledge + integrative understanding + sophisticated synthesis + wisdom teaching.
        Prerequisite: Intelligence Chain Level: 1-Initial minimum (AI collaboration enables knowledge amplification).
        Stage 1 (months 1-6): Multi-domain exposure (4+ fields), framework literacy (3-5 major models), synthesis practices, epistemic humility. Assessment: Articulate cross-domain connections? Framework conversant?
