In the middle of the desert, miles from any city, are two HUGE concrete tubes. They’re part of a giant machine running the most precise experiment humans have ever built… 

Each tube is 4 kilometers long, and inside there’s a big metal pipe. And at the end of each pipe, scientists place some of the smoooooothest mirrors ever made. And then they fire a powerful laser that gets split down each tube, bouncing it back and forth… building up more and more power… until… they bring those beams back together… to discover something that just 100 years ago scientists thought was impossible to find!

Finding it took hundreds of scientists and over a billion dollars. But what did we find?? And what’s the cutting edge we’re finding NOW that makes those scientists want to build… AN EVEN BIGGER ONE?

Let me show you…

Hey, welcome to the joke down low!

What did Gravity say to Light?
Nothing, it just waved!

Find a way to use “wave” in a comment to let me know you’re a real one who made it to the end of the description :)
