# Claude Workflow Thread: Best Way to Work with Claude

**Post 1 of 3**

this is hands-down the best way to work with Claude right now...

whenever you start a new project (startup, content, side hustle, anything...)

open a fresh chat with Opus 4.5, turn on extended thinking and dump everything about your project

then prompt this:
"ask me 5 questions that would help you have a complete understanding of this project"

answer those questions (spend a lot of time here)

then hit it with:
"you're my co-founder. create a master plan with a knowledge base directory for each section. attach context markdown files to every part. you're building the skeleton that Claude Code will use to build everything 10x faster. suggest skills to integrate, automations to build or any tool that'd 10x our speed. suggest when to use a project or Claude Code"

Claude will create every file you need, simply import them into Claude Code

from there you build systems and your project alongside it, use it like a Claude chat

it'll tell you when to spin up Claude Projects for specific tasks: deep research, writing, working with MCPs...

one planning session replaces weeks of figuring things out on your own

this is what working WITH AI looks like
