## Description (no transcript available)

This is the story of how complexity learned to build itself. A journey from the first cells that discovered teamwork, through the algorithms hidden in slime and swarms, to the moment simple rules became the architecture of everything alive.

Beauty this strange deserves a closer look.

Microscopic worlds. Bioluminescent life. Alien flora.
The same vivid biology from Omni films; transformed into high-resolution wallpapers for your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

Your lock screen doesn't need another sunset. It needs a reminder that life is stranger than fiction.

ABOUT OMNI
Stories about life, matter, and the mystery in between. Omni is a cinematic science channel dedicated to exploring the hidden beauty of biology and the fundamental questions of existence. We create long-form documentaries that reveal the patterns, processes, and phenomena most people never get to see.

From the microscopic to the cosmic, from evolutionary adaptations to the nature of consciousness itself; we transform complex science into visual narratives that feel like discovery, not lecture.
Every film asks: what have we been missing? What does life look like when you truly see it?
