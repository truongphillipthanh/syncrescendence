What's really happening with AI visibility tools in the enterprise? The common story is that AI-powered dashboards give leadership clarity — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why the single pane of glass is a trap:
• Why AI makes fake legibility even cheaper than real legibility 
• How tiger teams are the actual production engine of your company 
• What happens when leaders mistake AI omniscience for control 
• Why a five-person pod now outproduces traditional thirty-person teams

For leaders and builders, the opportunity is massive — but only if you use AI to amplify tiger teams instead of suffocating them with vapor metrics.
