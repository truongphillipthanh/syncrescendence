## Description (no transcript available)

Hala Taha sits down with Dr. Fei-Fei Li, one of the world’s most influential AI scientists, often called the Godmother of AI. As a Stanford Professor and Co-Director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI, Dr. Li has spent her career exploring how artificial intelligence can both empower and endanger humanity.
Dr. Li breaks down how AI systems learn, what they can and cannot do, and why ethics must be at the core of every technological breakthrough. She explains the difference between AI and machine learning, the evolution of computer vision, and how “human-centered AI” can preserve dignity, purpose, and creativity in an automated world.
This conversation dives deep into the philosophical and societal impact of AI, from how machines “see” the world to how technology might reshape jobs, democracy, and even consciousness itself. Dr. Li also discusses her new book The Worlds I See, sharing personal stories of her immigrant journey, caregiving for her parents, and how those human experiences shaped her scientific vision.
If you want to understand the future of artificial intelligence, and what it means to stay human in an increasingly automated world, this episode is a must-watch.
