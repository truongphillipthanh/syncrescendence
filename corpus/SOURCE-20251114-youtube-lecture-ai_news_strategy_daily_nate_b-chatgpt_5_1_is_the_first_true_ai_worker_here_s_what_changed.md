What's the real story with ChatGPT 5.1?
The common story is that 5.1 is “warmer,” but the reality is more complicated.

Chapters:
00:00 Introduction to ChatGPT 5.1
02:33 Enhanced Instruction Following
04:57 Dual Brain Functionality
07:33 Prompting as Specifications
09:38 Configurable Behavior and Personality

14:27 Reliability and Safety Improvements
16:19 Workflows Over One-off Tricks
18:22 New AI Literacy: Specifications and Judgment

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why ChatGPT 5.1 feels like the first truly agentic build model:
• Why sharper instruction-following now behaves like a real spec
• How instant vs thinking creates new latency–reasoning tradeoffs
• What spec-driven prompting unlocks for workflows and tools
• Where reliability, verification, and judgment matter most

Teams that learn to write simple specs and apply real judgment will outperform everyone still treating AI as a parlor trick.
