## Cross-References & Relationships

### Chain Dependencies (declared in frontmatter)

| Child Chain | Depends On |
|-------------|------------|
| CANON-32000 | CANON-00000, CANON-21000, CANON-31000 |
| CANON-32100 | CANON-32000, CANON-32110, CANON-32120 |
| CANON-32110 | CANON-32100, CANON-32000 |
| CANON-33110 | Intelligence Chain Level 1 (hard dependency) |
| CANON-35000 | CANON-30000, CANON-31000, CANON-32000, CANON-33000, CANON-34000 |

### Cross-Chain Synchronization Rules (from CANON-32000)

- Insight >2 stages ahead of Information = understanding without grounding
- Insight >2 stages ahead of Knowledge = theory without practice
- Insight >2 stages behind Wisdom = frameworks without wisdom integration
- Healthy: Insight slightly ahead of Expertise, coordinated with Wisdom

### Elemental-Chain-Modality Correspondence

| Element      | Chain     | Planetary   | Modality           | Energy Coil Output      |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Water        | INSIGHT   | Coherence   | Meaning-Making      | Refined understanding   |
| Fire         | EXPERTISE | Efficacy    | Intention-Formation | Economic vitality        |
| Earth        | KNOWLEDGE | Mastery     | Embodiment          | Crystallized capability  |
| Quintessence | WISDOM    | Transcendence| Strategic Harmony  | Harmonic resonance       |

### Sibling Chains (contextual, from CANON-32000 and CANON-35000)

- CANON-30000: INTELLIGENCE chain (substrate for all)
- CANON-31000: INFORMATION chain (signals requiring interpretation)

## Notable Patterns

### Pattern 1: Five Degrees Framework Reused Across Lunar Systems
- CANON-32110 (Coherence Synthesis): Five Degrees of Meaning-Making Integration
- CANON-35110 (Transcendence Synthesis): Five Degrees of Meta-Cognitive Integration
- Both use: Recognition → Exploration → Commitment → Integration → Transmission
- Both declare Degree progression INDEPENDENT of chain Level/Stage progression
- Pattern likely extends to other lunar systems outside this range

### Pattern 2: Four-Stage Trajectories Structurally Parallel
All four chains use four stages with the same progression logic:
- Stage 1: Foundation/conceptual entry
- Stage 2: Development/practice initiation
- Stage 3: Meta-cognitive/automatic competence
- Stage 4: Wisdom/teaching/transmission
Stage 4 in all cases requires multigenerational evidence (students demonstrating advancement)

### Pattern 3: Satellite Files Contain Operational Specifics
Ring/σ, planetary, and lunar files hold ontological/epistemological content.
Satellite files (33111, 33112, 35121) contain concrete operational data:
- Dollar figures, timelines, production schedules, medical/psychological pattern names
- This creates a clean ontology-praxis separation in the hierarchy

### Pattern 4: Neurodivergent Module Positioned Under Ring/σ, Not Planetary
CANON-35120 (Neurodivergent) is a lunar under the Transcendence Ring (35100), not under a planetary body.
This positions universal human variation adaptation as a system-level architectural concern, not a domain-specific one.
Implication: energy state management (Peak/Baseline/Depletion/Crisis) is global infrastructure.

### Pattern 5: WISDOM Chain Depends on All Other Chains
CANON-35000 lists CANON-30000, 31000, 32000, 33000, 34000 as dependencies.
WISDOM is explicitly described as "emerging last" — it is the terminal synthesis, not a parallel track.
The Ring/σ (Transcendence) orbital class reflects this: it contains the entire system rather than orbiting within it.

### Pattern 6: Operational Status Gradient
- operational (34000, 35000): Mature, usable
- partial (32000, 33110): Partially deployed
- theoretical (32100, 33000, 33100): Designed but not yet instantiated
Higher chain-level files tend to be more theoretical; lower satellite files tend to be operational.

### Pattern 7: Modal Sequence as Temporal Backbone
The Modal 1-4 sequence (Abstract → Simulated → Physical → Transcendent) appears in:
- CANON-34110 (Curriculum stages)
- CANON-35200 (Gaian Field Node as Modal 3-4 target)
- CANON-32120 (Meta-Analytical Framework alignment)
It functions as the system's temporal development map across all chains.

### Pattern 8: Metahumanism as Deepest Dependency
CANON-35210 (Metahumanism) is the deepest file in the hierarchy (lunar under lunar under ring).
It contains the philosophical substrate — 12 epistemic strata, 7 spiritual planes, Frankfurt volition hierarchy.
Its position at the bottom of the tree rather than the top inverts traditional ontological architecture:
the philosophical foundation is derived last, not assumed first.
