# I (finally) fixed my biggest problem with AI coding

I can crank out 10+ prototypes a day but somehow sharing my work is harder than its ever been.

The multiplayer canvas is gone.

Now it's desktop folders, screen recordings, and PRs.

You're telling me I have to use a bunch of engineering tools just to share a quick concept with my PM?

It's the final_v4_updated era all over again.

@sdothaney nailed it in the AI Design Field Report:

> "When you're using Claude Code or Cursor, we're actually now back in local space. It's more friction to share things again."

Thankfully those days are over.

I have a new workflow for sharing AI prototypes and it's changing everything about how I design 👇

## /share

Right now I'm working on a new landing page for @Inflight…

When I'm ready, all I have to do is type `/share` 👀

(Description: Screenshot showing a terminal interface with a file browser at the top reading "ridderingand/landing-page" with origin/main branch. Below is a "Brighten gradient" section with a "Share file" button. A large "/share" button appears on the right. The interface displays "10 tool calls, 9 messages" and includes the message "V2 has been shared successfully. Here's your Inflight link:" followed by "https://www.inflight.co/v/83b16931-f249-4d27-8162-5c4fc27b2f08". A note states "This version captures the updated gradient colors on the 'collaborate' text (lighter blue tones).")

That's it.

Claude spins up an @Inflight prototype which creates a feedback guide for stakeholders.

Artifact + context + feedback → one link I can drop in Linear, Slack, or wherever I work.

(Description: Screenshot of a split-screen interface showing code editor on the left with HTML/CSS content and an Inflight design preview on the right displaying a collaborative interface titled "Inflight is the fastest way for designers to collaborate in code." with an email input field reading "you@email.com" and text "Join 2,000+ designers and get early access".)

And if I need to explain my thinking, I can record a quick walkthrough.

Stakeholders can play with my prototype, share their thoughts, and I have everything I need to kick off the next version.

Every `/share` creates a snapshot. So when someone asks "can I see that other direction again?" it's right there in version history.

## About that landing page...

(Description: Video player showing a screencast of a web interface with a dropdown menu open, displaying options: "Preview Window Concept", "Shader Background", "Rotating Cards", and "New Version". The Claude terminal shows HTML code with syntax highlighting. Timeline shows 0:03 / 0:09 duration.)

I've only just started using `/share` and it already feels like the missing piece in my design practice.

Oh and btw I finished that landing page :)

Check it out and [get early access here](https://www.inflight.co/share) ✌️

The page shows an email input field with placeholder "you@email.com" and text "Join 2,000+ designers and get early access". A code editor window is visible on the left side with HTML/CSS code highlighted, and a preview area on the right showing design elements. Timeline shows 0:05 duration.)
