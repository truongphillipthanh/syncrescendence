What's really happening with AI agents and the dream of a personal chief of staff? The common story is that agents are already mainstream — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why 2026 is the breakthrough year for always-on personal AI agents:
• Why the 2026 hardware cycle finally enables consumer-ready agents 
• How memory scaffolding solves the persistent "amnesiac agent" problem 
• What a perpetually-on mini-me executive assistant actually requires 
• Where the critical UX layer is still missing today

Chapters:
00:00 Why 2026 is the year for personal AI agents 
01:30 The hardware upgrade cycle that changes everything 
02:28 Agents can finally sustain attention for hours 
03:30 Solving the amnesiac agent problem with scaffolding 
04:50 Defining work your agent can actually execute 
05:30 MCP, skills, and autonomous computer use 
07:09 The missing UX layer: your always-on right pane 
08:30 Why you need to be organized to delegate 
09:32 Two-part architecture: translation layer + task execution 
10:30 LLM work product is finally good enough 
11:15 Who will build the mini-me first?

All the technical pieces exist — perpetual agents, model context protocol, browser use, file manipulation. What's missing is an intuitive interface that translates your messy intentions into organized task lists an agent can execute. The business that solves this changes where people spend their time.

For operators and builders, the opportunity is significant — but capturing it demands new skills in task formulation and intentional delegation.
