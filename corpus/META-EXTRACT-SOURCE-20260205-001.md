## Claim (10)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-001-0001
**Lines**: 10-12
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.60

> AI arrived just in time to offset shrinking workforces and decades of weak productivity, and it fixes the economic math rather than breaking it.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-001-0002
**Lines**: 12-14
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Jobs don't disappear due to AI; instead, tasks shift, and AI amplifies differences by making good people better and great people unusually effective.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-001-0004
**Lines**: 22-25
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.80

> For roughly 50 years, real economic progress has underperformed historical norms, with productivity growth falling well below postwar levels and declining birth rates, indicating that the economic math stopped working.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-001-0005
**Lines**: 27-28
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.70

> AI is not a threat to human work but a lever that reshapes it.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-001-0008
**Lines**: 43-43
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.70

> AI accelerates the process of tasks shifting within jobs.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-001-0009
**Lines**: 45-47
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Panic about mass job loss misses the point because when population shrinks and productivity rises together, remaining human labor becomes more valuable, not less, due to scarcity.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-001-0010
**Lines**: 53-55
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> AI magnifies differences among individuals, making good people better and great people unusually effective, thus widening the gap.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-001-0012
**Lines**: 78-78
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Rarity comes from the overlap of multiple skills, not from dominance in a single skill.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-001-0014
**Lines**: 92-93
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Capitalism rewards things that are rare and valuable, and individuals become rare by combining skills that rarely coexist.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-001-0015
**Lines**: 95-97
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.70

> AI dramatically lowers the cost of combining skills, making adjacent skills like coding, writing, analysis, and design more accessible, thus collapsing the barrier to stacking.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-001-0007
**Lines**: 34-36
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Jobs are bundles of tasks, and tasks are fluid; when technology changes, tasks move, but jobs survive longer than any single task inside them.

## Framework (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-001-0011
**Lines**: 65-72
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The 'talent stack' is an individual strategy for an AI-driven economy, involving becoming very good (top 25%) at multiple things rather than trying to be the best in the world at a single thing.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-001-0013
**Lines**: 82-88
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The talent stack has two layers: 'cornerstone' skills that define output (e.g., writing + humor, engineering + systems thinking, design + taste) and 'commercialization' skills that turn output into leverage (e.g., business literacy, distribution, work ethic, risk tolerance).

## Praxis Hook (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-001-0003
**Lines**: 14-16
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The winning strategy in an AI-driven economy is the talent stack: combine multiple top 25% skills plus commercialization, because rarity comes from overlap, not being the best at one thing.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-001-0006
**Lines**: 28-30
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Stacking complementary skills, rather than chasing singular mastery, is the most reliable way to stay valuable in an AI-driven economy.

## Prediction (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-001-0016
**Lines**: 99-100
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The future does not belong to narrow specialists defending titles but to people who deliberately build combinations of skills.
