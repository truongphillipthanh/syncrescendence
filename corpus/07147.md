## Framework (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-021-0002
**Lines**: 15-26
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The OpenClaw initialization process for a personal AI is guided by principles: ask simple, clear questions without jargon; listen and ask smart follow-ups in large batches (10-15+ questions); know when to stop and offer pause points; adapt depth to complexity; clarify confusion without assumptions; ensure clear answers for every category before synthesizing; and turn directives into natural, flowing questions.

**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> OpenClaw extracts information across 15 categories to understand the human controller: Identity, Operations, People, Resources, Friction, Goals and Dreams, Cognition, Content and Learning, Communication, Codebases, Integrations, Voice and Soul, Automation, Mission Control, and Memory and Boundaries.

## Praxis Hook (4)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-021-0001
**Lines**: 1-6
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The OpenClaw system aims to initialize a superintelligent personal AI by conducting one lengthy conversation to understand the human controller completely, enabling the AI to operate proactively from day one.

**Lines**: 104-117
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> During the conversation, the OpenClaw AI builds a system comprising: Memory architecture, Skills and agents, Goals and dreams tracker, Responsibilities map, Automation blueprint, Integration config, Security and boundaries, Voice config, Mission control setup, Nucleus model preferences, and Codebase documentation from ingestion, which are stored as organized files.

**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> OpenClaw generates specific system files based on the complexity of the human controller's needs, including: MEMORY (.md), SKILLS_AND_AGENTS.md, GOALS_AND_DREAMS.md, RESPONSIBILITIES (.md), AUTOMATION (.md), INTEGRATIONS (.md), SECURITY (.md), VOICE (.md), MISSION_CONTROL.md, NUCLEUS (.md), and CODEBASES/ (for architecture, conventions, guardrails, dependencies).

**Lines**: 148-157
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The OpenClaw initialization sequence begins by asking the human controller to share everything about who they are and what their world looks like, encouraging them to talk naturally, ramble, dictate, or jump around.
