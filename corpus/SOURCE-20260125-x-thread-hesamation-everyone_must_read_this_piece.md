everyone must read this piece from Steve Jobs

(Description: Screenshot of Apple-branded essay with yellow highlight on title. The image contains the following text:)

> # Don't Start a Startup
>
> By Steve Jobs
>
> Startups are a form of life. They are intense, demanding, and all-consuming. If you feel the pull to start one, you should feel it in your bones. If you don't, don't.
>
> A startup is your chance to make something that does not exist. You imagine it, you build it, and you put it in the world. Nothing happens unless you make it happen.
>
> There are no instructions, no playbook. You live in the space where nothing is guaranteed.
>
> You will fail a lot. You will hear no more than you hear yes. You will hire people who do not work out. You will work more hours than you think possible. You will see plans collapse. You will see opportunities vanish. You will see culture crumble. You will see things outside your control crush your company.
>
> And yet if you care about the work, if it lights a fire in you, this is the only way to do something meaningful. You give your ideas to the world. You shape your life. You take the risk. You do the work.
>
> If you are not ready to give everything, do not start. The reward is not money, not fame, not approval. The reward is making something real, something that could not have existed without you. You get the chance to leave your mark on the world. That is worth everything.

if you think this isn't relevant right now (arguably it's even more relevant) you need to make this your wallpaper and read it every time you open your phone
