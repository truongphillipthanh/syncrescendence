Claude Cowork is a brand new tool from Anthropic that lets you collaborate with AI on a shared set of files. Instead of just talking, it can read your documents, do research, ask follow-up questions, and create real deliverables like Word docs, spreadsheets, and summaries.

In this video, I walk you through exactly how it works with two real-life examples: analyzing a 45,000-word book manuscript and planning a family road trip in Mexico. I also share the do's and don'ts I've learned after using it hands-on.
