## Description (no transcript available)

Join Tesla Owners Silicon Valley for an exclusive, in-depth behind-the-scenes look at the Vegas Loop! I spent 47 minutes riding LED-lit tunnels in a Tesla Model Y running Full Self-Driving (Supervised), touring active Prufrock boring machine sites, and sitting down with Steve Davis, President of @theboringcompany4601

Fresh from CES 2026, where the Loop transported 90,000+ passengers (peaking at 6,600+ riders/hour) and served 22,000+ trips to/from key spots like Resorts World, Encore, and Westgate — pushing total passengers past 3.5 million since 2021.

Key highlights:
FSD Underground: Zero-intervention rides through tunnels and seamless transition to surface streets
Airport Phased Rollout: Limited rides live now (100/130 vehicles airport-ready); Phase 2 tunnels opening soon; direct terminal station as the "holy grail"
Massive Expansion: 68 miles of tunnels, 104 stations, privately funded at ~$10M/mile — core Strip build starts fall 2026, targeting 2027 completion
Fleet Growth: Scaling to 160 → 250–300 vehicles; Robovans for high-occupancy surges (games, concerts)
Prufrock Power: High-speed boring (target 1 mile/week), handling groundwater realities in the desert
Future Vision: Suburbs (Henderson, Summerlin), potential Hyperloop links (e.g., Reno)

This isn't concept art — it's a real, operational system beating Strip traffic with fast, fun, emissions-free point-to-point Tesla rides.Would you choose the Loop over surface gridlock?
