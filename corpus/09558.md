## Description (no transcript available)

Mark Chen is one of the most influential people in artificial intelligence, and this episode is a rare look inside his world. As the Chief Research Officer at OpenAI, Chen helps decide which ideas get compute, which research threads scale, and how a 500-person lab navigates constant recruiting raids, model races, and the pressure to invent the next paradigm. We talk about the soup-delivering recruiting wars, how OpenAI thinks about staying ahead of Meta and Google, and what it actually feels like to rank 300 internal research projects when everyone believes theirs is the one that matters.

We also get into Chen’s path from math competitions and high-frequency trading to the early days of OpenAI, and how he ended up helping lead the company through its most chaotic moments. He talks about the breakthrough in reasoning models, the renewed focus on pre-training, the scientific discoveries GPT-5 Pro is already making, and why he thinks fully autonomous AI research is closer than people realize. This is a candid, high-bandwidth conversation with one of the key people shaping the direction of modern AI.
