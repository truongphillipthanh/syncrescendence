## Description (no transcript available)

Edward Frenkel is a professor of mathematics at UC Berkeley, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and winner of the Hermann Weyl Prize. He is also the author of Love and Math—part memoir, part masterclass in mathematical storytelling—which became a New York Times bestseller and has been published in 20 languages.

In this conversation recorded on 12 December 2025, Prof. Frenkel joins London Institute Fellow Yang-Hui He and our chief science writer Ananyo Bhattacharya for a wide-ranging discussion on the nature of mathematics: from his own intellectual journey to the mysteries of the Langlands programme—often described as mathematics’ “Theory of Everything”—and the enduring power of human intuition and creativity in the age of AI.
