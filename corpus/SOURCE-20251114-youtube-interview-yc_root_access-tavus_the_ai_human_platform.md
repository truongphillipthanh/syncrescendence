## Description (no transcript available)

Tavus is building real-time AI humans — systems that can see you, hear you, and respond with natural expression, emotion, and context. What began as personalized video has grown into a full platform used by companies from startups to the Fortune 10.

The team recently raised a $40M Series B to advance this vision, introducing PALs: agentic AI humans that can perceive, reason, and act on their own.

In this conversation with YC’s Diana Hu, founders Hassaan Raza and Quinn Favret share how they made the leap from generative video to real-time AI humans, the foundational models behind rendering and perception, and why they believe AI humans will become the next major interface for work and communication.
