_______________________
What's really happening with AI agents and long-running memory? The common story is that smarter models solve agent failures — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on what Anthropic revealed about why agents actually work:

 • Why generalized agents behave like amnesiacs with tool belts
 • How domain memory turns chaotic loops into durable progress
 • What the initializer and coding agent pattern actually does
 • Where the real moat lies in harness design, not model intelligence

For builders and operators, the strategic insight is clear: the competitive advantage is not a smarter AI but well-designed domain memory and testing loops.
