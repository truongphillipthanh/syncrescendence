## Objective

You are idle. Run a quick health self-check:
1. Verify your CLI is responsive
2. Check git status for uncommitted work
3. Check your INBOX for any missed tasks
4. Report any issues found

Write a brief status to your RESULT file. If everything is fine, just confirm you're operational.

## Expected Output

- Write results to `-OUTBOX/ajna/RESULTS/RESULT-ajna-20260217-idle_health_report.md`
- Or commit directly if you have write access
