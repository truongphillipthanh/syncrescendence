“We use a Palantir algorithm to pick sepsis up earlier and get patients on a treatment pathway. It’s resulted in a 68% reduction in 48 hour mortality... in the last two years, that's resulted in 700 additional patients being able to leave the hospital.”

Watch as Tampa General Hospital Senior Vice President & Chief Transformation Officer Dr. Peter Chang demos Modern Hospital OS — the Foundry-built operating system that customizes care for their patients.
