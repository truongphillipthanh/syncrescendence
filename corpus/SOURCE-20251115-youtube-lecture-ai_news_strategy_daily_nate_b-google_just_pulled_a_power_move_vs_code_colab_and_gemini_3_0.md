What’s really mattered this week?
The AI noise was all about GPT 5.1's new 'warm' personality. The truth is more complicated than that.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on the new shape of AI strategy and capability shifts across the industry:
• Why an AI-driven espionage campaign collapses the barrier to advanced attacks
• How GPT-5.1’s adaptive reasoning changes prompt engineering and execution
• What Cursor’s valuation says about agentic development and automation at work
• Where Gemini 3.0’s shadow release hints at the next state-of-the-art jump

The takeaway: operators and teams now face both accelerated leverage and accelerated risk as large language models drive real autonomy.
