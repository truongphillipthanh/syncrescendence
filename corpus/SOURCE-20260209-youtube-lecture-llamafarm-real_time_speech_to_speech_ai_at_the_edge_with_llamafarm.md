# Real-Time Speech-to-Speech AI at the Edge with LlamaFarm

**Channel**: LlamaFarm
**Published**: 2026-02-09

## Description (no transcript available)

Running a full speech-to-speech pipeline (ASR, LLM, and TTS) entirely on local hardware, no cloud APIs required.

In this talk, I walk through building a real-time voice-to-voice AI system using LlamaFarm, an open-source tool for deploying local LLMs with simple YAML configuration. We cover the full pipeline: automatic speech recognition, LLM processing via llama.cpp or transformers, and text-to-speech output — all running at the edge.

LlamaFarm is open source — check it out and contribute:
