Anthropic just launched Claude in Chrome – a browser extension that lets Claude see your screen, click buttons, and browse the web alongside you.
But the feature that sets it apart from Operator, Manus, and every other AI browser agent? You can record a workflow once, and Claude learns to repeat it on autopilot.
In this video, I'll walk you through:
→ How to install and set up Claude in Chrome
→ Agentic browsing – letting Claude navigate for you
→ Running tasks across browser tabs and Google Docs
→ Pulling data from multiple tabs to write a report
→ The "teach once, set and forget" workflow feature
→ Finding a specific section in a YouTube video
This is hands-down the most useful AI browser feature I've tested.
