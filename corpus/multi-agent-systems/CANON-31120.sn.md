# Κ-31120: Tone Library (SN)

PASS ToneLibraryDisseminationExecution:
    sutra: "Systematic architecture transforming framework concepts into platform-specific executable content at scale"
    gloss:
        The @TONE_LIBRARY operationalizes Syncrescendence dissemination by mapping rhetorical intentions through dimensional parameters (Style, Function, Evidence, Cadence, Diction, CTA, Guardrails) to produce variation within constitutional constraints. Without it, content production remains ad-hoc and founder-dependent; with it, every piece derives from proven patterns maintaining quality standards while serving strategic objectives. Strategic function: makes framework teachable at scale. Core innovation: dimensional mapping rather than generic templates.
end

PASS PurposeStatement:
    sutra: "Enable repeatable, high-quality content production across radically different platforms while maintaining voice integrity"
    gloss:
        The TONE_LIBRARY transforms abstract concepts into platform-specific content through systematic @Recipe application. Enables dissemination at scale without quality degradation or founder dependency. Maintains constitutional voice integrity through guardrail enforcement while adapting to platform physics constraints. Solves core dissemination problem: how to produce coherent, strategic content consistently across X/Twitter, Medium, YouTube, LinkedIn, newsletters simultaneously.

    sutra: "Nine-phase protocol from concept selection through iteration"
    gloss:
        Phase 1: Select concept requiring transmission, assess complexity, determine priority. Phase 2: Identify audience archetype, assess knowledge level, select platform per physics fit. Phase 3: Select existing @Recipe or compose new one specifying promise, opening move, register, archetype, function, style, cadence, diction, scaffold elements, CTA, guardrails, evidence types, assessment targets. Phase 4: Draft following Recipe parameters, implementing style pattern, cadence, diction, evidence deployment, opening move, function pattern, CTA, guardrails. Phase 5: Assess readability (Gunning Fog), breath math, word count, Recipe adherence, guardrail compliance, voice authenticity, platform appropriateness. Phase 6: Revise addressing guardrail violations, voice calibration, rhythm, proportion, clarity. Phase 7: Format per platform, publish, document production data, link Tone instance to Recipe. Phase 8: Track engagement metrics (reach, engagement, depth, conversion, retention). Phase 9: Analyze patterns, identify Recipe improvements, update TONE_LIBRARY with learnings.
