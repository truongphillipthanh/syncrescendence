**Fidelity**: Full (passes 1–10)
**Topic**: Reframing the Constellation Integration Architecture through the canonical Sovereignty Strata (σ₀–σ₇), correcting platform identifications (Antigravity, Codex App), and establishing the σ-annotated tool taxonomy for systematic onboarding.
**Initiated**: 2026-02-05
**Agent**: Commander (Opus) via Cowork

## Pass 1: Triumvirate Calibration

- **Destination**: An integration architecture that uses the canonical Sovereignty Strata (σ₀–σ₇) as its organizing principle, enabling every tool in the expanding stack to be precisely located in the sovereignty hierarchy and connected accordingly.
- **Why now**: Stack expanding rapidly — Antigravity (Google IDE), Codex App (OpenAI agent manager), content distribution, creative pipeline. REF-SAAS_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md v2.0.0 invented an ad hoc "Three Integration Rings" model that doesn't reference or align with the canonical σ₀–σ₇ framework. Also incorrectly identified Antigravity as OpenAI's product (it's Google's).
- **Current state**: Architecture doc exists with good content but wrong organizing metaphor. Sovereignty Strata (ARCH-SOVEREIGNTY_STRATA.md) exist as formalized CANON but aren't referenced by the integration doc.
- **Fit-to-destination**: PARTIAL — content is sound, framework needs recasting.

## Pass 2: 18+ Lenses (scorecard)

| Lens | Pass/Fail | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Sovereignty | ✓ | σ₀ authority preserved; outer layers serve inner |
| Portability | ✓ | Make vs OpenClaw boundary preserves optionality |
| Repo Sovereignty | ✓ | σ₄ ground truth principle maintained throughout |
| Simplicity | ⚠ | 8 strata more complex than 3 rings — but canonical wins |
| Actionability | ✓ | Sprint sequence remains concrete |
| Consistency | ✗ | "Rings" competes with canonical "Strata" — terminology drift |
| Scalability | ✓ | Forward horizon sections accommodate expansion |
| Layer Independence | ✓ | σ₇ tools swap without disrupting σ₂ |
| Translation | ✓ | Document readable without retransmission |
| Receipts | ✓ | Artifact committed to repo |
| Continuation | ✓ | Document survives conversation deletion |
| Attention Economy | ⚠ | σ₀ attention cost of managing expanding stack unclear |

Score: ~14/18. The consistency failure is the primary issue — competing taxonomies.

## Pass 3: CANON Coherence

- ARCH-SOVEREIGNTY_STRATA.md defines σ₀–σ₇ as the canonical concentric model for system sovereignty.
- The integration architecture's "Three Rings" model is a parallel taxonomy that doesn't reference σ₀–σ₇. This violates the principle that CANON documents define the organizing framework.
- The Strata model maps cleanly: σ₇ (execution) = tools/automations, σ₆ (access) = accounts/OAuth, σ₅ (intelligence) = models/platforms, σ₄ (ground truth) = repo.
- Resolution: Replace "Rings" with σ-layer annotations. Each tool gets a primary σ-layer. The document structure organizes by function (what tools DO) with σ-annotations (WHERE they sit in the sovereignty hierarchy).

## Pass 4: Omni-Qualities

- **Omniscience**: ✓ Comprehensive catalog + σ-mapping improves system self-knowledge at every layer.
- **Omnipresence**: ✓ Multi-channel coverage spans σ₇ execution surfaces across devices and platforms.
- **Omnipotence**: ✓ Make + OpenClaw + kanban dispatch enable action across σ₇ tools from σ₀ intent.
- **Omnibenevolence**: ⚠ Integration must serve σ₀ attention, not overwhelm it. Notification filtering (Make keyword filters, Slack channel segregation) is critical.

## Pass 5: Five Faces

- **Sensing**: ✓ Oracle, Cartographer, Augur, NotebookLM all mapped with integration paths.
- **Meaning**: ✓ Vizier, NotebookLM, praxis/synthesis/ all properly positioned.
- **Intention**: ✓ Linear (SYN-XX), ClickUp (meta), kanban dispatch (internal) all connected.
- **Embodiment**: ✓ CLI agents, OpenClaw, Antigravity, Codex App all at σ₇ with distinct paradigms.
- **Harmony**: ⚠ Need to ensure the σ₇ explosion (many new tools) doesn't fragment attention. σ₀ bottleneck is real.

## Pass 6: Rosetta Precision

Term corrections required:
- **"Ring"** → retire. Canonical term is **σ (Stratum)**. "Three Integration Rings" → "Sovereignty Strata Integration Model"
- **"Antigravity"** → Google's agent-first IDE (VS Code fork). Multi-model: Gemini 3, Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-OSS. σ₇ development surface. NOT OpenAI.
- **"Codex App"** → OpenAI's desktop multi-agent command center. Parallel threads, git worktrees, skills, automations, MCP. σ₇ agent manager. NOT an IDE.
- **"Layer"** → overloaded in current doc. Use "stratum" (singular) / "strata" (plural) for σ₀–σ₇. Use "integration tier" for functional grouping if needed.

## Pass 7: Backlog Coherence

- **Unblocks**: Every new tool gets an immediate σ-layer home. No more ad hoc "where does this go?" decisions.
- **Creates**: Need to update COCKPIT.md and REF-STACK_TELEOLOGY.md to cross-reference the σ-annotated integration architecture (future task, not blocking).
- **Priority**: HIGH — this is the organizing principle for all future tool onboarding. The stack is expanding faster than documentation can track without a systematic framework.

## Pass 8: nth-order Effects

- **Antigravity as multi-model surface**: Antigravity hosts Gemini 3, Claude Sonnet 4.5, AND GPT-OSS simultaneously. This challenges the "one platform per avatar" assumption. A single IDE session could embody INTERPRETER + COMPILER + DIGESTOR through model switching. This is a σ₅ convergence event at the σ₇ surface.
- **Codex App's MCP + Skills**: The Codex App gains parity with Claude Code through MCP connectivity and skills. The Adjudicator (Codex App) and Commander (Claude Code) become near-symmetric at σ₇, differentiated by model (GPT-5.3-Codex vs Opus) rather than capability.
- **σ₇ proliferation**: Antigravity, Codex App, Claude Desktop (Chat/Cowork/Code), OpenClaw, Gemini CLI — five distinct σ₇ execution surfaces, each with increasing agent autonomy. The σ₀ bottleneck (Sovereign attention) becomes the critical constraint.
- **Content distribution pipeline**: When X/Substack/YouTube activate, they add σ₇ surfaces for publishing. Each needs σ₆ (account auth) and σ₃ (context — what to publish). The σ₅→σ₇ chain is well-understood; the new challenge is σ₁→σ₇ (translating teleology into published content).

## Pass 9: Energy State

- Sustainable: YES. The revision is primarily conceptual reframing, not new infrastructure.
- The σ₀ attention cost of managing the expanding σ₇ is the real energy concern. Mitigation: OpenClaw orchestration (Ajna/Psyche absorb coordination overhead), Make automation (notifications without agent attention), kanban dispatch (file-based async).
- The Sovereign doesn't need to touch every σ₇ surface directly. σ₅ intelligence routing + σ₃ context engineering + σ₇ execution automation create a chain that reduces σ₀ load.

## Pass 10: Authenticity Gate

- **Sovereignty preserved**: Yes — the Strata model *is* the sovereignty model. Using it as the organizing principle for integration ensures every connection serves the center, not the periphery.
- **Optionality preserved**: Yes — σ₇ Layer Independence means Antigravity can replace Cursor, Codex App can complement CLI, tools can swap without σ₂ architectural changes.
- **Would Sovereign-at-peak-clarity approve**: Yes. The Strata model was explicitly designed for this: locating every tool in the sovereignty hierarchy. Using it to organize integration is exactly what it was built for.

## Convergent Path

1. **Reframe** the integration architecture through σ₀–σ₇ Sovereignty Strata (replace "Three Rings" with strata-aligned model)
2. **Correct** Antigravity → Google agent-first IDE (σ₇ development surface, σ₅ multi-model)
3. **Correct** Codex App → OpenAI agent manager (σ₇ execution, distinct from IDE paradigm)
4. **Annotate** every tool with its primary σ-layer
5. **Preserve** functional organization (tools grouped by what they DO) — strata annotations add WHERE they sit, not replace HOW they're organized
6. **Reference** ARCH-SOVEREIGNTY_STRATA.md as the canonical source for the organizing principle

## Rationale (digest)

- CANON defines σ₀–σ₇ as the concentric sovereignty model. The integration architecture should use it, not invent a parallel "Rings" system.
- Antigravity (Google) and Codex App (OpenAI) are distinct σ₇ tools with different paradigms: IDE vs agent manager.
- The σ₇-First principle governs implementation priority: get execution substrate working, then address higher strata.
- Each tool spans multiple strata but has a PRIMARY σ-layer that determines its integration pattern.
- The σ₀ attention bottleneck is the real constraint as σ₇ proliferates.

## Dependencies Created/Updated

- REF-SAAS_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md → v3.0.0 (major revision)
- Future: COCKPIT.md and REF-STACK_TELEOLOGY.md should cross-reference σ-annotations

## Falsifier

This approach is wrong if: (a) the Sovereignty Strata model proves too abstract for practical integration decisions (tool selection and configuration don't benefit from σ-layer awareness), or (b) the σ₇ proliferation proves beneficial rather than concerning (more tools = more capability, not more fragmentation).

## Confidence: HIGH
