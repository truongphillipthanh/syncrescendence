# Why are you locking yourself into single-model coding agents?

There's a ton of well-deserved hype around both Claude Code and Codex – they are awesome coding agents backed by incredible models (both of which we offer in Warp).
There is also a lot of enterprise adoption of these tools. I'm not privy to the exact way they are purchased, but in the course of helping companies adopt Warp we often find that they are also doing big rollouts of model-provider coding agents.
As a buyer, I'd think twice about doing this (and I acknowledge my bias here).
## The Problem with Coupling
When you buy a single-model coding agent you are essentially saying "we are betting on this model provider having both the best agent **and** best model for coding for some significant period of time." You are buying a tightly coupled product: app + model, and committing to using them together.
But the best coding model is changing frequently. Currently Codex 5.3 is best, but before that it was Opus 4.6, and before that (for a moment) Gemini 3 Pro, and before that Sonnet 4.5, and way back GPT-4, etc.
And not only are you comparing quality, but also the cost to get the same level of performance. I think open weight models are going to have a huge impact in the coming years, driving down costs while proving just as effective as frontier models (see [GLM-5's recent benchmark scores](https://z.ai/blog/glm-5)). By coupling your coding agent with your model, you're losing optionality as these models become available.
## Multi-Model Strategy
Finally, even within single tasks, there is value in having a mix of models to get the most cost effective outcome – use an open weight model for simple stuff and a frontier model for the higher intelligence parts of the task, or lean into the character of models like Opus 4.6 for docs writing and Codex for implementation.
## The PaaS vs. IaaS Analogy
The situation reminds me a bit of early cloud platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offerings like AppEngine compared to infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) like AWS. The clear winner has been IaaS because it decouples apps from the infrastructure they run on and creates clear interface points. You can build a Docker container that runs in AWS and move it to GCP or Azure and deploy k8s in either place. The models are the infra in this analogy and the agent is the app – they should stay separate and pluggable.
## Provider Incentives
The model providers realize this dynamic. One reason they are pushing their agents so hard is because the model layer may get commoditized for coding use cases and become more like selling low-margin compute. The safest way for them to ensure profits is by having a product at the agent layer, and one way they get adoption right now is by offering the model for less if you use it with their agents. They are doing this to entrench the agents so that down the road, they can charge more for them (or at least keep charging frontier inference rates, rather than open model prices).
## Enterprise Recommendation
Given that this is the dynamic, I'd think hard as an enterprise buyer if I want to buy tokens and agents from the same source – you'll get a better deal now, but in the long run, it sets up the vendor to extract rent and might keep you from being able to use cheaper models that are just as effective. The better long term move for enterprises buying coding agents, IMO, is to pick an app or harness that is multi-model or multi-harness and standards compliant, so the model piece can be subbed in and out. Think of it like buying a car (agent) vs buying gas (tokens) – you wouldn't want to be forced to buy gas from your car dealer…
Of course, I'm highly biased here, but I would bet big money that in a few years you won't want to be paying frontier model rates for tokens. So plan accordingly.
