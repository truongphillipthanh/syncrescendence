Enterprise AI is failing — not because LLMs aren’t powerful, but because context is missing.

After massive spend, endless prompt tweaking, and impressive demos…
most teams are still stuck asking the same uncomfortable question:

“Why doesn’t this work in production?”

In this episode, we break down why prompt engineering is a dead end — and why Context Engineering is the real unlock for 2026.

This isn’t another “just write better prompts” video.
It’s a systems-level reality check.

What you’ll learn in this episode:

✅ Why treating AI as an “oracle” guarantees unreliable outputs
✅ The difference between prompts, context, and engineered systems
✅ The 5 Levels of Context Sophistication (from guessing to semantic blueprints)
✅ Why roles, goals, and specifications matter more than clever wording
✅ How Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables scalable multi-agent systems
✅ Why enterprises need a dual RAG system (knowledge vs. instructions)
✅ The hidden importance of traceability and “glass-box” AI
✅ How to take context engineering from theory to production — without burning teams

Featuring:

Dennis – Context Engineering expert & author
(Delivering a full masterclass on multi-agent context design)

The core idea:

The future of AI isn’t better prompts.
It’s better context, better specifications, and better systems.

The teams that win in 2026 won’t be talking to chatbots.
They’ll be orchestrating agents with clearly defined roles, goals, and semantics.

AI doesn’t fail because it’s dumb.
It fails because we don’t tell it enough.
