## Claim (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260214-056-0001
**Lines**: 20-21
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The field of AI systems is evolving from single agents to sequential agents, then to agent teams, and finally to agent swarms.

## Concept (5)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260214-056-0002

**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.60

> An Agent Swarm involves a goal agent that automatically spawns other agents, and a synthesizer that clusters and reconciles their findings, similar to a random forest algorithm.

**Lines**: 30-30
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Deep Research is a supervisor-driven approach that narrows and verifies information to reduce uncertainty, prioritizing accuracy and avoiding errors.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260214-056-0005
**Lines**: 31-31
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.60

> An Agent Swarm prioritizes parallel exploration to maximize discovery, accepting the risk of missing something in favor of broad exploration.

**Lines**: 32-32
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.60, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Agent Teams focus on structured execution, allowing control over agent roles and actions.

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260214-056-0007
**Lines**: 42-42
**Context**: method / limitation
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.80

> To prevent multi-agent systems from consuming excessive tokens, it is practical to constrain the number of agents and their tool usage.
