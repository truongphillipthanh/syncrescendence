## Files Written/Updated under `~/.openclaw/workspace/`

| File | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `SOUL.md` | **Updated** | Added Syncrescendence Operating Law section (5 invariants + CAPTURE→DISPATCH→RETURN). Preserved existing Ajna identity and vibe. |
| `USER.md` | **Updated** | Added canonical repo pointer, operating reality section, updated budget/device info. Preserved existing structure. |
| `SYNCRESCENDENCE.md` | **Created** | New quickstart pointer file per bundle spec. |
| `MEMORY.md` | **Preserved** | Already contains rich curated memory (Constellation, strategic context, thread extraction, etc.) — far richer than bundle template. Not overwritten. |
| `IDENTITY.md` | **Preserved** | Ajna identity intact. |
| `AGENTS.md` | **Preserved** | Existing governance intact. |

## Memory Search

Already completed as separate task (TASK-20260202-openclaw_memory_search_setup):

```
Provider: openai / text-embedding-3-small
Indexed: 12/12 files · 145 chunks
Vector: ready (1536 dims)
FTS: ready
Verification: "Objective Lock" → CLAUDE.md (score 0.30) ✅
```

## Design Decision: Merge, Not Replace

Ajna's existing workspace files were richer than the bundle templates. I merged the bundle's key additions (Operating Law, repo pointers, operating reality) into existing files rather than overwriting. This preserves months of curated context in MEMORY.md and maintains Ajna's identity per the task constraint.

## Blockers

None. Both tasks complete.
