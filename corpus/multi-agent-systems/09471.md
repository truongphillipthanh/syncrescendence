## Description (no transcript available)

DeepAgent just rolled out its biggest upgrade yet, and the whole platform jumped into real autonomy. The new version builds full web services on its own, wires backend logic, designs API contracts, deploys everything as production-ready endpoints, and even debugs inside a virtual computer. All of this now runs on the upgraded stack inside Abacus AI with Gemini 3 powering ChatLLM, which pushes the speed and stability way past anything from the earlier releases. This video breaks down how DeepAgent works, how it creates full products in minutes, and why 2025 feels like the moment autonomous engineering finally becomes real.
