# Κ-25200: Platform Constellation Architecture (SN)

PASS Canon25200PlatformConstellationArchitecture:
    sutra: "Five-platform AI constellation ($100/month) optimized for polymathic synthesis via specialized role assignment."
    gloss:
        Multi-AI architecture spanning @Claude(3 accounts), @Gemini(Advanced), @ChatGPT(Plus) designed to maximize capability while maintaining sovereignty. No redundancy; each platform serves distinct functional role. Total investment $100/month; sustainability target 2026-01-31.
        Core principle: no single platform possesses complete @capability_matrix required. Architecture is multiplicative, not additive.
end

PASS MultiplatformAiOrchestrationSpecification:
    sutra: "Purpose-specialized constellation with task routing, rate limits, context handoff, and ground truth synchronization through repository."
    gloss:
        @Constellation represents distributed cognition system where Principal's cognitive load → zero and output quality → maximum. Repository is single source of truth; all platforms synchronize through git. @Three_Accounts architecture provides resilience via heterogeneous authentication (Account 1: Apple; Accounts 2,3: Google).
end

TERM IOverview:
    sutra: "Constellation Model, Platform Composition, Constitutional Basis."
    gloss:
        @Constellation_model: purpose-specialized multi-AI design maximizing capability while maintaining strategic sovereignty. Platform composition: Claude Pro ($60, 3 accounts), Gemini Advanced ($20, 1 account), ChatGPT Plus ($20, 1 account) = $100/month total. Constitutional basis from Oracle 12: "Claude Code wielded by Claude Opus 4.5 represents seismic step change" and imperative to "capitalize on heavy machinery to construct Syncrescendence and match pace."
end

PASS TheConstellationModel:
    sutra: "Composition and cost-benefit rationale for five-account constellation."
    gloss:
        Each platform serves distinct role requiring different capabilities. Total investment $100/month justified by capability gain vs. cost. No single platform excels across all required functions (strategic synthesis, execution, ingestion, reasoning, verification).
end

PASS PlatformComposition:
    sutra: "Five-account distribution: 3 Claude, 1 Gemini, 1 ChatGPT; $60+$20+$20."
    gloss:
        Account structure enables parallel execution and specialized surfaces. Claude distributed across three surfaces (web interface for synthesis, two Claude Code instances for parallel execution). Gemini and ChatGPT provide unique capabilities not available in Claude alone.
end

PASS ConstitutionalBasis:
    sutra: "Oracle 12 directs full constellation utilization through end of month."
    gloss:
        Direct quotes from Principal: Claude Opus 4.5 via Claude Code represents transformational capability. All 3 Claude + 1 Gemini + 1 ChatGPT to be retained. Imperative: capitalize on infrastructure to construct Syncrescendence with matching velocity and acceleration.
end

PASS IiPlatformSpecializations:
    sutra: "Five platforms with distinct functional roles, surfaces, capabilities, and zone ownership."
    gloss:
        Each platform optimized for specific cognitive tasks. Specialization enables routing decisions based on task type rather than platform availability.
end

PASS ClaudeAccount1Oracle:
    sutra: "Strategic synthesis via web interface; project memory, artifacts, deep research; shared 45msg/5h rate limit."
    gloss:
        @Function: Strategic @synthesis, multi-thread coordination, directive authorship, 18-lens evaluation. @Surface: Claude.ai web. @Project: syncrescendence (persistent per-project memory). @Capabilities: projects (memory isolation), artifacts, deep research (45-minute sessions), Python sandbox, MCP. @Rate_limit: ~45 messages per 5-hour window (shared across all Claude surfaces). @Memory: project-scoped persistent; cross-session context via project memory; decisions logged to ARCH-ORACLE_DECISIONS.md.
end

PASS ClaudeAccount2Alpha:
    sutra: "Primary execution engine via Claude Code CLI; production-critical zone (Alpha); full R/W access; extended thinking via triggers."
    gloss:
        @Function: Primary @directive_execution, architecture implementation, CANON creation, ledger atomicity. @Surface: Claude Code CLI. @Zone: Alpha (production-critical). @Responsibilities: filesystem access, git ops, MCP integration, extended thinking triggers, parallel processing with Beta. @Zone_ownership: sources/processed/a-*, orchestration/logs/*-A.md, stream A. @Integration: reads directives from orchestration/directives/, writes logs to orchestration/logs/, updates ledgers in orchestration/state/. Coordinates with Beta through repository ground-truth-sync.
end

PASS ClaudeAccount3Beta:
    sutra: "Secondary execution engine via Claude Code CLI; experimental zone (Beta); isolated worktree; parallel capacity with Alpha."
    gloss:
        @Function: parallel stream @execution, testing, validation, overflow capacity, independent @verification. @Surface: Claude Code CLI. @Zone: Beta (experimental/parallel). @Capabilities: identical to Alpha; isolated worktree prevents conflicts. @Zone_ownership: sources/processed/b-*, orchestration/logs/*-B.md, stream B. @Coordination: Alpha ↔ repository ↔ Beta ensures ground-truth synchronization across execution streams.
end

PASS GeminiAdvancedIngestionLayer:
    sutra: "YouTube + large corpus processing (2M context); native 263 tok/sec multimodal; transcription + diarization; source triage."
    gloss:
        @Function: @ingestion (YouTube, large corpus), transcription, speaker diarization, source triage. @Surface: Gemini CLI / web. @Capabilities: native video understanding (263 tokens/sec), 2M context window, Gemini CLI, Jules async (future), Google integration. @Unique_value: extra-textual multimodal without transcript dependency. Automated pipeline potential. @Output_pattern: YouTube URL → [Gemini processes] → source document (processed/) → [synced to repository] → Claude integration.
end

PASS ChatgptPlusReasoningLayer:
    sutra: "GitHub workflows + abstract reasoning via Codex CLI & web; GPT-5.2 reasoning; voice interface; @codex PR reviews."
    gloss:
        @Function: GitHub @workflow automation, PR review (@codex mention), abstract reasoning (GPT-5.2), mobile voice capture, alternative perspective. @Surface: Codex CLI / ChatGPT web. @Capabilities: terminal GitHub ops, @codex PR comments, GPT-5.2 reasoning model, Advanced Voice Mode, Canvas collaborative editing. @Integration: code ready → [Codex CLI] → PR created → [@codex review] → review comments → [Claude execution] → incorporation.
end

PASS IiiOrchestrationPatterns:
    sutra: "Task routing matrix, rate limit management, context handoff patterns, ground truth via repository."
    gloss:
        Orchestration determines which platform handles which task class. Routing based on platform strength + availability. Rate limits shared across Claude surfaces; managed via account rotation. Context handoff uses standardized patterns: Oracle → Claude Code (directive → file → execution), Gemini → Claude (processed corpus → integration), ChatGPT → Claude (PR → feedback → incorporation). Repository serves as @ground_truth; all platforms synchronize through git.
end

PASS TaskRoutingMatrix:
    sutra: "Primary/secondary assignments for task types: YouTube→Gemini, code→Claude, reasoning→ChatGPT/Oracle, synthesis→Oracle."
    gloss:
        YouTube processing: @Gemini (native 263 tok/sec multimodal). Production code: Claude Alpha/Beta (zone ownership). Strategic synthesis: Claude Oracle (deep research). Large corpus: Gemini (2M context). GitHub workflows: ChatGPT Codex (@codex). Abstract reasoning: ChatGPT (GPT-5.2). Source integration: Claude Alpha/Beta (CANON access). Parallel execution: Alpha + Beta (multi-stream).
end

PASS RateLimitManagement:
    sutra: "Claude shared 45msg/5h pool across 3 accounts; rotate between accounts; extended thinking auto-enabled; Gemini/ChatGPT separate quotas."
    gloss:
        @Claude_Pro: ~45 messages per 5-hour window per account; rotate between 3 accounts if hitting limits; extended thinking auto-enabled; use for complex architectural analysis. @Gemini_Advanced: generous CLI limits. @ChatGPT_Plus: standard GPT-4o limits; GPT-5.2 may have tighter quotas; Codex CLI separate from chat.
end

PASS ContextHandoffPatterns:
    sutra: "Standardized patterns: Oracle→Code (directive file), Gemini→Claude (git commit), ChatGPT→Claude (GitHub comments)."
    gloss:
        Oracle → Claude Code: directive with context → orchestration/directives/ → Claude Code reads + executes → log saved → sync. Gemini → Claude: processed output → sources/processed/ → git commit+push → Claude pulls+integrates → CANON. ChatGPT → Claude: Codex creates PR or reviews code → GitHub comments → Claude Code incorporates → merge.
end

PASS GroundTruthSynchronization:
    sutra: "Repository is single source of truth; all platforms (Oracle, Code×2, Gemini, ChatGPT) synchronize through git."
    gloss:
        All outputs converge to repository. Repository state is authoritative. Platforms cannot operate on ephemeral cloud context; all substantial decisions flow through version-controlled files. Cross-platform consistency guaranteed by repository as @ground_truth. Single commit hash identifies system state at any moment.
end

PASS IvCapabilityMatrix:
    sutra: "Feature comparison across platforms: context window, extended thinking, video, project memory, GitHub @mentions, voice."
    gloss:
        Claude Oracle: ~200K context, extended thinking ✓, project memory ✓, artifact generation, analysis tool, MCP. Claude Code: ~200K context, extended thinking (triggers), full filesystem R/W, git ops, parallel. Gemini: 2M context, native video ✓, Jules async, limited MCP, no extended thinking. ChatGPT: ~128K context, extended thinking (o-series), Canvas, GitHub @codex ✓, voice ✓, file upload (512MB×80).
end

PROC ProcessingSpeedObserved:
    sutra: "Speed benchmarks: Gemini video (263 tok/sec), Claude code generation (real-time), Gemini corpus scan (2M single pass), ChatGPT PR review (async)."
    gloss:
        YouTube processing via Gemini: 263 tokens/sec (unmatched). Code generation via Claude Code: real-time. Large corpus scan via Gemini: 2M tokens in single stateless call. PR review via ChatGPT @codex: asynchronous within GitHub interface.
end

PASS VIicMapping:
    sutra: "IIC-to-platform affinity: Acumen→Gemini, Coherence→Oracle, Efficacy→Code, Mastery→Oracle, Transcendence→Oracle."
    gloss:
        @Interlocutor_Identity_Configuration mapping to optimal platforms. Acumen (signal qualification): Gemini + Oracle. Coherence (framework synthesis): Oracle + Code. Efficacy (execution): Code + ChatGPT. Mastery (pedagogical): Oracle. Transcendence (strategic synthesis): Oracle + all. Cross-platform transitions use @CANON-25100-CONTEXT_TRANS protocol with IIC-specific framing.
end

PASS IictoplatformAffinity:
    sutra: "Each IIC has natural platform strengths based on cognition style and task requirements."
    gloss:
        Affinity table maps each @IIC to primary+secondary platforms. Routing decisions consider both task type and IIC requirements for optimal synthesis.
end

PASS CrossplatformIicHandoff:
    sutra: "Generate handoff context per CANON-25100; include IIC framing; specify available capabilities; document for traceability."
    gloss:
        When work requires IIC transition: generate handoff via context transmission protocol, include IIC-specific framing for target platform, specify platform capabilities available at target, document in execution log. Three-step pattern ensures context continuity across platform boundaries.
end

PASS ViSustainabilityRoadmap:
    sutra: "Self-sustaining by 2026-01-31 via consulting, courses, ontology products, agent services."
    gloss:
        $100/month investment must become self-sustaining. Revenue paths: consulting (immediate, variable), courses (30-60d, $50-500/mo), ontology products (60-90d, $100-1000/mo), agent services (90+d, $500+/mo). Cost optimization if needed: reduce to 2 Claude ($20), downgrade Gemini ($10), drop ChatGPT ($20) = potential $50/mo savings, but NOT recommended during critical velocity phase.
end

PASS GoalSelfsustainingBy20260131:
    sutra: "Platform investment ($100/month) must generate offsetting revenue within 3 weeks of document creation date."
    gloss:
        Deadline: 2026-01-31 (3 weeks from canonical date 2026-01-11). Revenue must cover $100/month operational cost. Do NOT optimize prematurely; constellation designed for maximum velocity during critical phase.
end

PASS RevenuePaths:
    sutra: "Four revenue streams with timeline and monthly potential: consulting (immediate, variable), courses (30-60d, $50-500), ontology ($60-1000), agents (90+d, $500+)."
    gloss:
        Immediate: consulting leverage (variable income). 30-60 days: course/curriculum deliverables ($50-500/month). 60-90 days: ontology products and frameworks ($100-1000/month). 90+ days: autonomous agent services ($500+/month). Portfolio approach spreads risk across multiple streams.
end

PASS CostOptimizationIfNeeded:
    sutra: "Priority cost cuts (if needed): reduce Claude to 2 accounts ($20), downgrade Gemini ($10), drop ChatGPT ($20)."
    gloss:
        Optimization sequence: Priority 1 = reduce to 2 Claude accounts ($20/mo savings). Priority 2 = downgrade Gemini to Pro ($10/mo savings). Priority 3 = drop ChatGPT Codex ($20/mo savings). Total possible reduction: $50/month to $50/month minimum. Caveat: premature optimization reduces velocity; only execute if revenue targets not met.
end

PASS ViiSecurityConsiderations:
    sutra: "Account isolation, repository access controls, protected zones (canon/, orchestration/oracle/, CLAUDE.md, coordination.yaml)."
    gloss:
        @Account_isolation: distinct credentials per platform; no credential sharing. @Repository_access: Claude Code (full R/W), Gemini CLI (specific directories), ChatGPT Codex (GitHub audit trail), Oracle (read-only via MCP). @Protected_zones: canon/ (requires Oracle approval), orchestration/oracle_contexts/, CLAUDE.md, coordination.yaml. Each zone has explicit ownership and modification rules.
end

PASS AccountIsolation:
    sutra: "Each platform account has distinct credentials; no credential sharing between platforms."
    gloss:
        Platform independence prevents cascade failures. Account 1 (Apple) independent from Accounts 2&3 (Google). API keys (if used) platform-specific. Compromise of single account limits exposure to that platform only.
end

PASS RepositoryAccess:
    sutra: "Claude Code: full R/W; Gemini: specific dirs; ChatGPT: GitHub audit; Oracle: read-only MCP."
    gloss:
        Tiered access model. Claude Code executors require full filesystem and git capabilities (production-critical). Gemini CLI writes only to sources/processed/ and designated ingestion zones. ChatGPT Codex operates through GitHub with permanent audit trail. Oracle maintains read-only visibility via MCP or manual exports.
end

PASS ProtectedZones:
    sutra: "canon/ (canonical docs), orchestration/oracle_contexts/, CLAUDE.md, coordination.yaml require explicit approval for modification."
    gloss:
        Four critical protection points. canon/ requires Oracle approval; foundational documents. orchestration/oracle_contexts/ contains Oracle-only directives. CLAUDE.md embeds constitutional rules. coordination.yaml specifies multi-account coordination. Modification controls prevent accidental corruption of system infrastructure.
end

PASS ViiiEvolutionPath:
    sutra: "30-day: ChatGPT Codex, Jules, MCP standardization, YouTube→CANON pipeline. 60-90d: browser automation, batch processing, inter-platform messaging. 90+d: self-orchestration, revenue generation, multi-repo coordination."
    gloss:
        Near-term (30d): full Codex CLI integration, Jules async evaluation, standardize MCP across platforms, automate YouTube ingestion pipeline. Medium-term (60-90d): browser automation for account operations, scheduled batch processing, inter-platform messaging beyond repository, performance analytics. Long-term (90+d): self-orchestrating constellation, revenue-generating workflows, multi-repository management, third-party platform integration.
end

PASS Nearterm30Days:
    sutra: "Integrate ChatGPT Codex CLI; evaluate Jules async; standardize MCP; automate YouTube→CANON pipeline."
    gloss:
        Actions: ☐ ChatGPT Codex CLI full integration, ☐ Jules async agent evaluation, ☐ cross-platform MCP standardization, ☐ automated YouTube → CANON pipeline. Timeline: 30 days from 2026-01-11 = by 2026-02-11.
end

PASS Mediumterm6090Days:
    sutra: "Browser automation for account operations; scheduled batch processing; inter-platform messaging; performance analytics dashboard."
    gloss:
        Actions: ☐ browser automation for multi-account management, ☐ cron-based batch execution, ☐ inter-platform messaging layer (beyond git), ☐ metrics dashboard. Timeline: 60-90 days = 2026-03-12 to 2026-04-11.
end

PASS Longterm90Days:
    sutra: "Self-orchestrating agent constellation; autonomous revenue workflows; multi-repository coordination; third-party integration."
    gloss:
        Actions: ☐ minimize manual orchestration, maximize autonomous decision-making, ☐ revenue-generating workflows run without Principal intervention, ☐ coordinate across multiple repositories, ☐ integrate external platforms (Slack, Discord, Stripe). Timeline: 90+ days = 2026-04-11 onward.
end

PASS AppendixAQuickReference:
    sutra: "Platform activation commands, emergency contacts, version history."
    gloss:
        Quick commands: Claude Code Alpha (`cd ~/Desktop/syncrescendence && claude`), Claude Code Beta (`cd ~/Desktop/syncrescendence-beta && claude`), Gemini CLI (`cd ~/Desktop/syncrescendence && gemini`), ChatGPT Codex CLI (`codex "review this PR"`). Recovery contacts: Claude (claude.ai/settings), Gemini (one.google.com), ChatGPT (platform.openai.com, truongphillipthanh@icloud.com).
end

PASS PlatformActivationCommands:
    sutra: "Shell commands to activate each platform instance."
    gloss:
        `cd ~/Desktop/syncrescendence && claude` = Claude Code Alpha. `cd ~/Desktop/syncrescendence-beta && claude` = Claude Code Beta. `cd ~/Desktop/syncrescendence && gemini` = Gemini CLI. `codex "review this PR"` = ChatGPT Codex. Each activates the respective platform's interface.
end

PASS ClaudeCodeAlpha:
    sutra: "Primary execution surface: cd to main repo, invoke claude command."
    gloss:
        @Surface: main syncrescendence directory. @Activation: `cd ~/Desktop/syncrescendence && claude`. @Function: primary @directive execution, zone A operations, production code.
end

PASS ClaudeCodeBetaSeparate:
    sutra: "Secondary execution surface: cd to beta worktree, invoke claude command, isolated from Alpha."
    gloss:
        @Surface: separate worktree (syncrescendence-beta). @Activation: `cd ~/Desktop/syncrescendence-beta && claude`. @Function: parallel stream execution, zone B operations, testing/validation. Isolated filesystem prevents conflicts with Alpha.
end

PASS GeminiCli:
    sutra: "Gemini command-line interface for corpus processing and ingestion operations."
    gloss:
        @Activation: `cd ~/Desktop/syncrescendence && gemini`. @Function: large corpus analysis, video processing, evidence pack generation. Uses Google AI Pro subscription on Account 3.
end

PASS ChatgptCodexCli:
    sutra: "ChatGPT Codex CLI for GitHub workflow automation and PR operations."
    gloss:
        @Activation: `codex "task description"`. @Function: GitHub workflow automation, PR creation, @codex review comments, terminal-based code operations. Separate quota from ChatGPT web interface.
end

PASS EmergencyContacts:
    sutra: "Recovery points for platform account management and subscription issues."
    gloss:
        Claude: claude.ai/settings (subscription management). Gemini: one.google.com (Advanced subscription). ChatGPT: platform.openai.com (account at truongphillipthanh@icloud.com). Each platform has distinct recovery path.
end

PASS VersionHistory:
    sutra: "v2.0.0 (2026-01-11): Genesis establishment; Authority: Oracle 12."
    gloss:
        v1.0.0 established 2026-01-11 as canonical. Specified 5-platform @constellation, task routing, IIC mapping, sustainability roadmap. Authority: Oracle 12. Last verified 2026-02-05.
end

PASS TeleologicalAnalysis:
    sutra: "Architecture evolution from foundational premise through platform/surface/device/authentication/connector teleology."
    gloss:
        Why @constellation exists: no single AI platform possesses complete @capability_matrix. Architecture is multiplicative. Why @Three_Accounts: heterogeneous authentication (Apple + Google) provides resilience. Why @five_platforms: distinct cognitive functions (interpretation, compilation, digestion, reasoning, verification). Why @four_surfaces: different tasks demand different interfaces (CLI, desktop, web, mobile). Why @repository_ground_truth: cloud state is ephemeral; filesystem is durable. Teleological core: minimize friction between intent and output.
end

PASS FormerlyCanon25210ConstellationArchitecture:
    sutra: "Teleological analysis merged from CANON-25210 per lean-out directive (2026-02-01)."
    gloss:
        CANON-25210 content (foundational premise, account/platform/surface/device/repository/authentication/connector teleology) integrated into this document as TELEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS section. Reduces document fragmentation.
end

PASS ITheFoundationalPremise:
    sutra: "No single platform masters complete capability matrix; constellation is multiplicative, not additive."
    gloss:
        @Foundational_premise: each platform excels in narrow band; constellation composes bands into unified instrument. System capability exceeds sum of parts. Teleological core: minimize Principal's cognitive load while maximizing output quality.
end

PASS IiTheThreeaccountArchitecture:
    sutra: "Account 1 (Apple/stable), Account 2 (Google/parallel), Account 3 (Google/cognitive) provide resilience + capability."
    gloss:
        Three-account design serves redundancy + ecosystem access. Account 1 (Apple auth): immutable foundation, repository origin, Google-independent stability. Account 2 (Google auth): parallel execution capacity, G Suite access, disaster resilience. Account 3 (Google auth): primary thinking interface, full G Suite connectors, @Gemini_Pro subscription. Heterogeneous auth prevents single points of failure.
end

PASS Account1TheSovereign:
    sutra: "Apple-authenticated stable substrate; repository origin; Google-independent; COMPILER home; device bridge."
    gloss:
        Email: truongphillipthanh@icloud.com. Auth: Sign in with Apple (not Google). Why: isolation from Google ecosystem provides stability. Functions: (1) authentication independence, (2) ecosystem separation, (3) sovereign origin ownership. Appears everywhere Principal works (Atlas+Comet browser on both Macs, iTerm on both). COMPILER role (ChatGPT) lives here (forced isolation, no G Suite leak-in).
end

PASS Account2TheParallel:
    sutra: "Google-authenticated parallel execution capacity; Mac mini secondary; backup G Suite access."
    gloss:
        Email: icloud.truongphillipthanh@gmail.com. Auth: Sign in with Google. Why: parallel execution on Claude Desktop, G Suite backup. Functions: (1) dual Sonnet executors simultaneous with Account 3's Opus, (2) G Suite redundancy if Account 3 Google auth fails. Device: Mac mini (always-on, stationary). Rationale: high-throughput batch operations benefit from concurrent instances.
end

PASS Account3ThePrimary:
    sutra: "Google-authenticated thinking interface; MacBook Air primary; full G Suite + Gemini Pro; INTERPRETER/DIGESTOR home."
    gloss:
        Email: truongphillipthanh@gmail.com. Auth: Sign in with Google. Why: full G Suite connectors + Gemini 1M token context. Functions: (1) primary ideation (Claude Web INTERPRETER), (2) corpus sensing (Gemini DIGESTOR), (3) productivity tool integration (Gmail, Drive, Calendar). Devices: MacBook Air (primary workstation), iPhone 15 (primary mobile). Roles: INTERPRETER (Claude Web), DIGESTOR (Gemini Web), ORACLE (Gemini CLI).
end

PASS IiiPlatformTeleology:
    sutra: "Platform roles: Claude (interpret), ChatGPT (compile), Gemini (oracle/digest), Grok (red-team), Perplexity (verify), GitHub (tissue)."
    gloss:
        Six distinct teleologies. Claude: interpretation (transform ambiguous inputs to structure). ChatGPT: compilation (explicit specs → formatted artifacts). Gemini: oracle (corpus sensing 1M context) + digestor (clarified output). Grok: red-team (adversarial perspective, X Firehose). Perplexity: verification (fact-check, citations). GitHub: connective tissue (fork/sync enabling distributed access).
end

PASS ClaudeTheInterpreter:
    sutra: "Transform ambiguous ideas into structured understanding via project memory, past chat search, extended thinking."
    gloss:
        Why Claude for interpretation: (1) project isolation (per-project memory), (2) past chat search (cross-thread synthesis), (3) extended thinking (genuine reasoning). Why NOT for execution: thread length limits trigger context eviction. Correct pattern: think in Claude Web, execute elsewhere, return for integration.
end

PASS ChatgptTheCompiler:
    sutra: "Transform complete specifications into correctly formatted artifacts via Canvas and file handling."
    gloss:
        Why ChatGPT for compilation: (1) Canvas (persistent workspace, refinement across sessions), (2) file upload (512MB×80 files), (3) mechanical formatting capability. Why NOT for interpretation: global memory creates cross-contamination risks. Account 1 isolation prevents this. Project-Only Memory mode disables global learning.
end

PASS GeminiTheOracleAnd:
    sutra: "Gemini CLI as ORACLE (1M context corpus sensing); Gemini Web as DIGESTOR (clarified summaries); G Suite integration."
    gloss:
        Gemini CLI: 1M token @context_window enables corpus survey in single call. Evidence pack generation (exact file lists, findings, verification commands). Stateless call, reproducible. Gemini Web: output style toward digestible prose, TTS-optimized summaries. Thread continuity across sessions (no context collapse). Gem feature links to Drive; live-synced file access.
end

PASS GrokTheRedTeam:
    sutra: "Adversarial perspective via X Firehose access; stress-testing and objection identification; auxiliary (no persistent config)."
    gloss:
        Role: red-team, adversarial voice, social context sensing. Why auxiliary: no projects, memory, custom instructions—but this enables fresh attack vectors. When idea needs stress-testing or discourse context: Grok. Invoke when verification required, not in daily loop.
end

PASS PerplexityTheVerifier:
    sutra: "External verification, fact-checking, authority confirmation; auxiliary, discrete queries with citations."
    gloss:
        Role: Pro Search for fact validation. Why auxiliary: no persistent config, excels at discrete queries. Correct pattern: invoke for specific verification, capture cited response, return to core loops. When claim requires external authority validation: Perplexity.
end

PASS GithubTheConnectiveTissue:
    sutra: "Fork/sync architecture enables distributed version control; Account 1 owns origin; Accounts 2&3 maintain forks."
    gloss:
        Not an AI platform but essential infrastructure. Fork/sync model: Account 1 origin (Apple-authenticated, stable). Accounts 2&3 forks (enable platform-native GitHub integrations per account). Prevents connector permission conflicts. Git synchronization = @ground_truth propagation.
end

PASS IvSurfaceTeleology:
    sutra: "Four surfaces: CLI (execution), desktop app (persistent session), web (full capability), mobile (capture)."
    gloss:
        Surface selection drives capability access and friction level. CLI: highest fidelity (filesystem direct access, scriptability, headless). Desktop: persistent session (survives browser crash). Web: maximum capability (projects, custom instructions, extended thinking). Mobile: capture + review (interruptible contexts). Each surface solves distinct problem.
end

PASS CliTheExecutionSurface:
    sutra: "Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI; direct filesystem access, scriptability, headless operation."
    gloss:
        Why CLI for execution: (1) direct file access (no sandbox), (2) scriptability (pipelines, Makefiles, hooks), (3) headless operation (batch processing, auto mode). Transformation of plans into implemented changes with proof. API key authentication: Claude Code + Codex use Account 1; Gemini CLI uses Account 3.
end

PASS DesktopAppThePersistent:
    sutra: "Claude Desktop, ChatGPT Desktop, Perplexity Desktop; persistent sessions surviving browser restart."
    gloss:
        Middle ground between web (ephemeral) and CLI (scriptable). Desktop apps maintain state independently. Extended Claude Code sessions (Opus EXECUTOR-LEAD on MacBook Air, dual Sonnet on Mac mini) run as desktop app wrapper around CLI for stability. Account binding: Claude Desktop MacBook Air = Account 3 (Opus); Claude Desktop Mac mini = Account 2 (parallel Sonnet).
end

PASS WebBrowserTheThinking:
    sutra: "Maximum platform capability: projects, custom instructions, extended thinking, artifacts, canvas, past chat search."
    gloss:
        Web is richest interface. Claude Web: project memory, past chat search, extended thinking. ChatGPT Web: Canvas, Projects, GPT Store. Gemini Web: Gems with Drive integration. When Principal needs full capability → web. Browser-account binding: Chrome Account 3, Atlas+Comet Account 1, Orion Account 2 (Mac mini). Cmd+Tab switching instead of logout/login.
end

PASS MobileTheCaptureSurface:
    sutra: "Capture fleeting thoughts, review/approve from anywhere; low friction input but interruptible contexts."
    gloss:
