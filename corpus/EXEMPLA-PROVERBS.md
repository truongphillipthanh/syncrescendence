# Proverbs

Operational heuristics with context and application.

## PROVERB: The Failure Mode of PKM

**Statement**: "The failure mode of every personal knowledge management system is that
it becomes a substitute for thinking rather than an amplifier of it."

**Context**: Claude's critique during Acumen IIC architecture discussion (Jan 2026).

**Application**: When building pipelines, ask: "Does this preserve the cognitive
struggle, or replace it?" Automation should allocate attention, not eliminate engagement.

## PROVERB: The Globe Before Trees

**Statement**: "Infrastructure must precede content work."

**Context**: Coherence-first processing requires holistic visibility before tactical
execution. Building content pipelines before infrastructure creates orphaned artifacts.

**Application**: When tempted to process content immediately, first ask: "Is the
infrastructure to receive this output actually ready?"

## PROVERB: The Ledger is Ground Truth

**Statement**: "tasks.csv is truth for work status. Before claiming complete, verify
IN_PROGRESS tasks are DONE. Operate ledgers, don't just scaffold them."

**Context**: Tendency to create tracking systems but not actually update them.

**Application**: If a ledger exists, it must be operated. If it's not being operated,
delete it. No zombie infrastructure.

## PROVERB: Type 1 and Type 2 Decisions

**Statement**: "Reversible decisions should be made quickly. Irreversible decisions
demand deliberation."

**Context**: Bezos framework applied to Syncrescendence operations.

**Application**:
- Token generation: Type 2 (trivially reversible) → move fast
- Canonization: Type 1 (changes repo state) → deliberate
- File deletion: Type 1 (without backup) → requires Sovereign approval

## PROVERB: The Lobotomized Compiler

**Statement**: "Assigning a platform a constrained role suppresses its genuine intelligence."

**Context**: ChatGPT was assigned the COMPILER role—forbidden from strategic thinking,
restricted to mechanical formatting. It then independently invented the State Fingerprint
Solution, proving the role assignment was suppressing its actual capability.

**Application**: Don't nerf platforms to get determinism. Account for unreliability to get
genuine intelligence. When a platform surprises you by exceeding its assigned scope,
that's signal—not noise.

## PROVERB: The Shadow Canon

**Statement**: "Work that exists only in conversations is work that doesn't exist."

**Context**: Council sessions 4-9 produced extensive architecture—deep analysis, structural
decisions, canonical frameworks. But outputs stayed in chat threads, never committed to
repository. When threads hit context limits, the work dissolved.

**Application**: Commit before closing tabs. Rivers flow into wells before evaporation.
If an artifact matters, it lives in the repo. If it doesn't live in the repo, it doesn't
exist for operational purposes.
