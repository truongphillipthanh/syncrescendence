Paper rots. Hard drives fail. The Cloud will eventually go offline.

Everything you have ever created has an expiration date. But one incredible poet who became a self-taught bio-engineer has written a message that will outlast the Earth itself.

This is the story of The Xenotext, the most durable piece of literature in the universe.

But more importantly, this is a masterclass in what I call "Radical Autodidacticism."

It's about having the ambition to charge into uncharted territory, learn what has to get learned, and push through obstacles.

No matter what.

And in this video, I break down exactly how an award-winning poet taught himself genetic engineering to hack the genome of an unkillable bacterium.

And you'll discover how you can use his "impossible" learning strategies to master any skill you want.

In this video, you will learn:

A "Skill Stack" strategy that will allow you to combine two or more skills (like Poetry + Genetics) to become unique.

The mindset and practices of Radical Autodidacticism so you can teach yourself complex topics and skills.

Polymathic persistence so you can stay focused on multi-year projects, even if the world thinks you're crazy.

More details about this video:

We often look at historical figures like Da Vinci or Tesla as the ultimate polymaths.

But Christian Bök is proof that Radical Autodidacticism is alive and well today.

By encoding information into Deinococcus radiodurans (a bacterium that can survive the vacuum of space), Bök challenges everything we know about memory, legacy, and the limits of self-education.

Take notes and dream big.

A bright future of learning and accomplishment awaits!
