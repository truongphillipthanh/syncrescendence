The AI race has been static since 2022. That's about to change.

The common story is that ChatGPT is leading the AI race — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on the coming Google–Apple–OpenAI shift:
• Why Gemini 3 could reset distribution across mobile
• How default assistants reshape LLM adoption and UX power
• What builders and engineers must rethink about model volatility
• Where executives should rebalance AI budgets and workflow bets

The takeaway: teams that treat AI as workflow transformation—not model worship—will navigate the reset with far more leverage.
