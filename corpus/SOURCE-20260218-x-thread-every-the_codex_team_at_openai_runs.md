synopsis: "The Codex team at OpenAI runs its own coding agent on its own codebase The Codex team at OpenAI runs its own coding agent on its own codebase. @danshipper asked @thsottiaux and @ajambrosino what automations and skills they use daily.

key_insights:
  - "Ambrosino runs an automation every hour or two that scans for conflicts and quietly resolves them, so code is always ready to ship."
  - "It picks a random file from the codebase and looks for bugs, uses a random number generator so each run explores a different corner, and catches non-critical bugs nobody would have gone looking for."

# The Codex team at OpenAI runs its own coding agent on its own codebase
The Codex team at OpenAI runs its own coding agent on its own codebase.
@danshipper asked @thsottiaux and @ajambrosino what automations and skills they use daily. Here are five of them (some of them run while the team sleeps).

## 2/ Hourly merge-conflict resolver:
When multiple people work on the same codebase, changes collide. Ambrosino runs an automation every hour or two that scans for conflicts and quietly resolves them, so code is always ready to ship.
(Description: Text box containing article excerpt: "How the Codex team uses its own AI - Two features make the Codex app especially powerful: "automations," which let you schedule prompts to run hourly, daily, or at whatever cadence you set, and "skills," which bundle instructions so that Codex can connect to external tools and run workflows that go beyond code generation, including research, reporting, and writing. These are a few automations and skills that Sottiaux and Ambrosino find useful:")

## 3/ Random bug hunter:
Sottiaux runs this multiple times a day. It picks a random file from the codebase and looks for bugs, uses a random number generator so each run explores a different corner, and catches non-critical bugs nobody would have gone looking for.
---
## 4/ Silent bug fixer:
Reviews the pull requests you have done over the past day, scans for signs anything is breaking, and pushes a fix before anyone notices you shipped a bug.
---
## 5/ Daily team digest at 9 a.m.—a summary of everything merged the previous day, grouped by contributor and theme. Daily marketing intel—searches the web for how users perceive Codex, compiled into a short report.
---
## 6/ The "yeet" skill:
Commit, open PR, write the title and summary—one click. Plus Ambrosino made a personalized children's book for his kids using Codex's image generation with a script, illustrations, and a printable PDF.
