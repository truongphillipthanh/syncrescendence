n8n just dropped a new Guardrails node, and it’s a game-changer for anyone building AI automations. In this video, I break down exactly what guardrails are, why they matter, and how you can use them to keep your workflows safe and reliable. 

Guardrails help you automatically detect and handle things like personal data, secret keys, malicious URLs, or unsafe content before it ever reaches your AI model. I’ll walk you through each guardrail type, show real examples, and explain when and why you’d want to use them. The best part is that you can set all of this up in n8n with no code, so whether you’re protecting your data or building safer AI systems, this video will show you how to do it step by step.
