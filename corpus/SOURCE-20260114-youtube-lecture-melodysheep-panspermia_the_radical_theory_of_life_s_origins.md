Extremophile bacteria may be resilient enough to survive the intense 3-stage journey, by repairing their own damaged DNA or hibernating for the long and deadly journey through space. 

The chemistry of life could even be spreading across solar systems to other parts of the galaxy, connecting biologies together in a huge web of life.   Could we be a part of an ancient cosmic family tree?   What other creatures could this tree contain?

Thanks for watching everybody. It feels so good to step back into the world of Life Beyond.  It feels like I am still scratching the surface... what theories should we investigate next??
