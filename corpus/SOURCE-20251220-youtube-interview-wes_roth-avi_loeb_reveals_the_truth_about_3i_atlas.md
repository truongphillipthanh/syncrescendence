TIMELINE
0:00 Cold open + Avi Loeb intro
0:55 Why only 3 interstellar objects so far? (ʻOumuamua, Borisov, 3I-ATLAS)
2:47 How we started finding them
5:05 Loeb’s 2014 “interstellar meteor” expedition
7:28 “There should be a quadrillion"
9:05 Panspermia + 3I-ATLAS chemistry
10:00 Light sails and tech analogies
10:46 Sci-fi light sails → Breakthrough Starshot concept
11:18 Sunlight push vs comet outgassing
14:58 Tesla Roadster catalog mistake + “expand the training data” analogy
16:10 Why misclassification matters (risk framing; “can’t judge by its cover”)
20:00 Using AI to find “outliers” (Galileo Project strategy)
18:30 Dylan’s AI question: training telescopes to detect machine signatures
19:09 Loeb’s approach: train on known objects → search the tails (outliers)
21:43 What features matter (speed, acceleration, performance envelope)
22:00 Galileo Project observatories + publish-to-peer-review commitment
23:01 Looking far: Dyson spheres and infrared searches (limits, false positives)
30:00 Origins, trajectories, and Mars as a “museum”
28:51 Can we trace where these objects came from? Why it’s hard
29:15 Population inference: what the speed suggests about star age (ʻOumuamua vs 3I-ATLAS)
31:57 Mars: possible life transfer + caves/lava tubes as “space archaeology”
35:58 Transition: Fermi paradox setup
40:00 Fermi paradox, scientific culture, and “heretics”
36:13 Loeb’s take: “you can’t ask until you invest” (funding + search effort)
40:38 Galileo/Vatican analogy + “ignorance doesn’t change reality”
42:12 Critique of string theory culture; falsifiability and experimental “guillotine”
48:51 Science vs politics incentives; accountability theme
50:00 How to spend money + innovation portfolio + AI humility ending
51:07 “Unlimited resources”: fund experiments, reward deviation, diversify research bets
54:48 Hinton/neural nets analogy (backing unfashionable ideas)
56:13 “Cosmic modesty”: AI child + alien intelligence, and what that would do to culture
1:00:07 Using AI leaders to expand the search + closing optimism and farewell
