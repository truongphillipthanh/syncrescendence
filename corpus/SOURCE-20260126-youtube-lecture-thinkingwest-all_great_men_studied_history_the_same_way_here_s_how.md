Thomas Carlyle’s Great Man Theory is a controversial historical lens that argues world history is merely the biography of a select few figures. From Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great to Napoleon and Shakespeare, elite figures use creative genius and willpower to shape civilization. Carlyle’s "top-down" history contrasts Herbert Spencer’s social history and Howard Zinn’s "history from below." But Great Man theory is more than just history --Machiavelli and Plutarch believed it could be used to achieve real world success.
