> Training an LLM on classical mechanics will not allow it to predict quantum phenomena like the double-slit interference pattern, as such outcomes are forbidden by the classical system's rules.

> Learning within a closed theoretical system prevents the generation of hypotheses that the system itself rules out; a learner must be able to rewrite the system.

> To achieve genuine AI creativity and discovery, systems must be designed to actively generate new knowledge and interact with the physical world, not just retrieve existing information.

> Applying Category Theory manually to find isomorphic patterns across domains is a slow, human intelligence-driven process.

## Concept (3)

> A critical juncture exists in AI deployment in sciences: building AI 'assistants' for retrieving known information versus building AI capable of genuine creativity, discovery, and synthesis.

> Category Theory can be used to find mathematical isomorphisms between disparate fields, mapping structural principles from one domain (e.g., spider silk) to another (e.g., music) to identify underlying principles applicable elsewhere.
