## Pass 1: Triumvirate Calibration

### Destination
The dependency chain is: **Current → Ontology → Gaian**. PROJ-006b (Ontology Substrate) just unblocked when SOVEREIGN-009 ratified. This is the single most important thing in the system.

### What Just Happened (Last 24 Hours)
1. CLARESCE^3 v2 complete (3 passes, corpus audit, 6.3/10 coherence score)
2. SOVEREIGN-009 RATIFIED — all 5 tool stack decisions, REF-STACK_TELEOLOGY v1.0.0
3. SOVEREIGN-012 Phase 1 done — credentials migrated to env vars
4. SOVEREIGN-013 done — Psyche personality restored on Mac mini
5. SOVEREIGN-008 confirmed closed
6. 10 new Linear issues created (SYN-51–60, Epic 8: Multi-Methodology Stack)
7. Psyche committed Tranches I-J (172 IMPL entries, 19 nextUp items)
8. DYN-BACKLOG.md is STALE — still shows PROJ-003 at 50%, PROJ-006b BLOCKED

### Fit-to-Destination Verdict
**GREEN.** The audit phase is over. Four SOVEREIGN blockers resolved. The road to PROJ-006b is clear. The risk is inertia — continuing to audit/clarify instead of building.

## Pass 2: Rapid Health Scorecard

| Vector | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Repo integrity | GREEN | Clean tree, commits linear, hooks firing |
| Credential hygiene | YELLOW | Env var migration done, rotation PENDING (Sovereign web portal) |
| Agent constellation | YELLOW | Psyche restored, Adjudicator/Cartographer dispatch still failing, MBA unconfigured |
| PROJ-003 (Stack) | GREEN | 95% → decisions ratified, onboarding tracked in SYN-51–60 |
| PROJ-006b (Ontology) | GREEN | UNBLOCKED — can begin |
| T1a↔T2 bridge | RED | Still only 1/174 IMPL items linked to Linear (Pass 3 finding) |
| DYN-BACKLOG.md | RED | Severely stale — 7+ fields out of date |
| Canon health | GREEN | 98.7% schema-compliant, 79 files consistent |
| Syncrescript | AMBER | Dormant, HIBERNATE approved but not formally enacted |
| IMPL-MAP | GREEN | 172 entries, 19 nextUp (Psyche's Tranches I-J) |
| Energy/momentum | GREEN | Machine is built. Sovereign is engaged. Decisions flowing. |

**Score: 8/11 GREEN, 2 YELLOW, 1 RED = healthy, with one critical gap (T1a↔T2 bridge)**

## Pass 3: Forward Vectors — Ranked by Critical Path Impact

### Tier 1: CRITICAL PATH (Do Now)

| # | Action | Why | Effort | Unblocks |
|---|--------|-----|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Update DYN-BACKLOG.md** — refresh all stale project statuses | Ground truth is wrong. PROJ-003 says 50%, actually 95%. PROJ-006b says BLOCKED, actually UNBLOCKED. | 15min | Everything downstream — all project tracking relies on this |
| 2 | **Close PROJ-003** — mark 100% COMPLETE | All 5 disposition decisions ratified. Onboarding (SYN-51–60) is separate workstream. | 5min | PROJ-006b start, dependency graph accuracy |
| 3 | **Begin PROJ-006b** — SQLite pilot from CANON-30300 schema | This IS the critical path. Schema exists. CSV data exists. Build the database. | 2-4h | PROJ-007 (Curriculum), PROJ-004, Palantir ontology |

### Tier 2: HIGH VALUE (This Sprint)

| # | Action | Why | Effort |
|---|--------|-----|--------|
| 4 | **CLARESCE^3 v2 Top 10 Corrections** — execute items #1-5 | Pass 3 identified 10 corrections at ~6h total. First 5 are quick wins. | 2h |
| 5 | **T1a↔T2 bridge** — link IMPL items to Linear issues | The tiers are disconnected (1/174). Quick bulk-link via GraphQL. | 1h |
| 6 | **Begin SYN-55 (Airtable)** — feeds directly into Palantir ontology | Sovereign confirmed "for sure." Airtable's relational model maps naturally to ontology. | 1h |
| 7 | **Credential rotation (SYN-57)** — Sovereign web portal action | Security exposure persists until keys rotated. | 10min (Sovereign) |

### Tier 3: MOMENTUM (Queue)

| # | Action | Why | Effort |
|---|--------|-----|--------|
| 8 | **SYN-59 (Notion LifeOS)** — configure personal context manager | INT-1616, INT-C008, INT-C010 all converge here | 2h |
| 9 | **MBA Ajna setup** — OpenClaw + NVIDIA provider + launchd | Personality files ready. Physical setup pending. | 2h (physical) |
| 10 | **SYN-58 (Methodology framework)** — document Prince2/Critical Chain/etc. | Knowledge work — can be parallelized to Cartographer | 2h |
| 11 | **CANON-25200 schema fix** — the single corrective from Pass 2 | 3 field renames in 1 file. Trivial but keeps canon clean. | 5min |

---

## Convergent Path

**EXECUTE, DON'T ANALYZE.** The machine is built. The audits are done. The decisions are ratified. The single highest-value next action is:

1. **Update DYN-BACKLOG.md** (ground truth refresh — 15 min)
2. **Close PROJ-003** (5 min)
3. **Begin PROJ-006b** (the entire system points here)

Everything else is parallel work that can flow while the ontology substrate is being built.

### Falsifier
This path is wrong if: the Sovereign redirects energy to revenue generation (INT-1201 deadline reset), IEETC interview outcome changes professional trajectory, or the multi-methodology onboarding (SYN-51–54) is deemed prerequisite to PROJ-006b rather than parallel.

### Confidence
**HIGH.** The dependency chain is clear. The blockers are resolved. The canon says build the ontology. The backlog says build the ontology. The intentions say build the ontology. Do it.
