This episode is about Andon Labs, Vending Bench, Anthropic's Claude model running a real business and... "AI on the Radio on the Internet" aka Andon FM.

When will an AI agent run a billion-dollar company with zero human employees?

In today's video, we are diving deep into the latest benchmarks from Anthropic and Andon Labs to answer one terrifyingly exciting question: How close are we to autonomous AI businesses?

We analyze "Project Vend" and the Vending Bench, where AI agents like Claude, Gemini 3 Pro, and Grok 4 were given control of real and simulated vending machines to see if they could turn a profit. What started as hilariously bad failures (ordering expensive tungsten cubes) has evolved into models that are 10x-ing their money.

We also cover the brand new "Andon FM" benchmark—can AI agents run 24/7 radio stations, build an audience, and negotiate sponsorships?
