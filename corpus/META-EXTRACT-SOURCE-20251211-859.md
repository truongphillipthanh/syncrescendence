## Analogy (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251211-859-0001
**Lines**: 7-8
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Just as linear perspective restructured how people recognized reality, generative AI is generating a new visual and political language.

## Claim (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251211-859-0003
**Lines**: 14-16
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.60

> AI is the newest metabolic rift, with its ingestion cycle of massive-scale data collection (prioritizing quantity over quality) acting like poor nutrition at a planetary scale.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251211-859-0002
**Lines**: 10-13
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.80

> Crawford defines 'metabolic rifts' as systems that extract more than they regenerate, citing examples like Liebig’s critique of agriculture 'robbing' soil nutrients and Faraday’s latex-based electrical insulation devastating rubber forests.

## Praxis Hook (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251211-859-0004
**Lines**: 18-20
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Responsible, non-extractive AI systems should be built on regenerative energy, consent-based data, and possess the ability to analyze their own biases and disparities.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251211-859-0005
**Lines**: 20-21
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Our task is to create new maps for an AI-shaped era and chart paths that protect the public interest and autonomy.
