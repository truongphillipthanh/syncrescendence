# Henrik von Scheel: Engineering in the Fourth Industrial Revolution

## Core Thesis
Engineering as a discipline is fundamentally transforming from specialized technical mastery to "integrative intelligence"—the ability to connect domains, think in systems, and adapt continuously. The Fourth Industrial Revolution demands engineers who can integrate physical and digital, work across disciplines, and design for resilience.

## Key Insights

### Fourth Industrial Revolution Characterization
- Third/fourth wave currently hitting
- Megatrends colliding create paradigm shifts
- 250-year-old principles breaking down
- Three conditions met: technological advancement, economic necessity, social readiness

### New Engineering Competencies
**Core shift**: Technical mastery alone → Integrative intelligence

**Four cross-competencies required:**
1. **Systems thinking**: See component interactions and emergent properties
2. **Digital fluency**: Understand digital logic and data architecture
3. **Collaborative design**: Work across disciplines and cultures
4. **Adaptive learning**: Continuously update as technologies evolve

**Critical insight**: Half of current knowledge obsolete in 5 years

### Megatrend Domains

**Energy Transformation:**
- Centralized fossil → distributed renewable networks
- Smart grids becoming intelligent ecosystems
- Electrification of everything (transport, heating, industry)
- Grid needs 2-3x capacity expansion while becoming smarter

**Manufacturing Revolution:**
- "Intelligent reconfiguration"—adaptive, responsive, continuously learning factories
- Mass production → mass customization
- Efficiency optimization → resilience optimization
- Product-as-a-service replacing ownership (Rolls-Royce sells thrust hours, Michelin sells kilometers)

**Supply Chain Resilience:**
- Pure cost efficiency → resilience, visibility, adaptability
- Regionalization, near-shoring, diversification
- Circular economy: linear → circular material flows
- Design for supply chain resilience from beginning

### Automation vs. Digitalization vs. AI
| Type | Application | Scope |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Automation | Non-core, repetitive processes | 60-80% routine |
| Digitalization | Complex, performance-driven | New capabilities |
| AI | Strategic, judgment-required | Learning and adaptation |

**Key principle**: Nature of activity determines appropriate approach
