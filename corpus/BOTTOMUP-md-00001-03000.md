## CLUSTER A — ClawdBot / Moltbot / OpenClaw

**Description**: Community articles, personal essays, how-to guides, and use-case threads about the ClawdBot/Moltbot/OpenClaw autonomous AI agent framework (the lobster-branded open-source claude.ai desktop agent, later rebranded OpenClaw). Topics: initial reviews, setup guides, memory systems, security, use cases, cost optimization, multi-agent configs, phone integration.

**Brand evolution within cluster**: ClawdBot → Moltbot → OpenClaw (same product, three names, articles spanning all three naming periods — this is a legitimate progression, NOT duplication).

### Files:
00042.md, 00043.md, 00044.md, 00045.md, 00046.md, 00048.md, 00049.md, 00050.md, 00051.md, 00052.md, 00053.md, 00054.md, 00055.md, 00056.md, 00057.md, 00059.md, 00060.md, 00062.md, 00063.md, 00064.md, 00066.md, 00068.md, 00069.md, 00071.md, 00073.md, 00079.md, 00080.md, 00081.md, 00083.md, 00092.md, 00097.md, 00107.md, 00111.md, 00122.md, 00123.md, 00124.md, 00129.md, 00131.md, 00136.md, 00137.md, 00143.md, 00155.md, 00160.md, 00162.md, 00165.md, 00166.md, 00167.md, 00168.md, 00179.md, 00191.md, 00193.md, 00195.md, 00197.md, 00198.md, 00203.md, 00205.md, 00209.md, 00211.md, 00214.md, 00220.md, 00246.md, 00247.md, 00251.md, 00254.md, 00264.md, 00266.md, 00272.md, 00275.md, 00278.md, 00280.md, 00290.md, 00291.md, 00295.md, 00298.md

### Same vs. different:
Mostly genuinely different perspectives (personal reviews, beginner guides, expert setups, security deep-dives, business use). A few overlap in topic but are NOT identical.

### CONFIRMED CRUSH CANDIDATES within Cluster A:

**Pair 1 — Exact title survivors:**
- `00111.md` — "Call Your OpenClaw over the phone using ElevenLabs Agents" (5,088 bytes)
- `00137.md` — "Call Your OpenClaw over the phone using ElevenLabs Agents" (5,204 bytes)
- VERDICT: Near-identical article, slight image description wording differences. One is a minor reformat of the other. **Crush 00111.md** (shorter, older).

**Pair 2 — Near-identical title:**
- `00123.md` — "🔑 openclaw + minimax = the $14/month ai agent" (22,766 bytes, emoji lowercase title)
- `00124.md` — "🔑 OpenClaw + MiniMax = The $14/Month AI Agent" (12,949 bytes, emoji proper-case title)
- VERDICT: Same article. 00123 is longer (has extra content sections). 00124 appears to be an abbreviated version. **Crush 00124.md** (shorter, less complete).

**Pair 3 — Near-identical title:**
- `00081.md` — "20 More Clawdbot Setups That Made Me Say 'Wait, It Can Do That?'" (15,367 bytes)
- `00136.md` — "10 More Clawdbot Setups That Made Me Say 'Wait, It Can Do That?'" (4,477 bytes)

## CLUSTER H — Extraction Files (Atom Extractions from Sources)

**Description**: 648 files in the range 01059–03000, each with header `# Extraction: SOURCE-{date}-{id}`. These are structured atomic knowledge extractions from source materials (YouTube transcripts, articles, X threads). Each file references a named SOURCE file that does NOT exist as a numbered .md file in the corpus — the source files appear to have been separately named and are not in this range.

**File pattern**: Every 3rd file starting at 01059 (01059, 01062, 01065...). The intervening files (01060, 01061 etc.) are absent — they were presumably deleted in the dedup pass or never existed as .md files.

**Source types** (within the 648 files in range):
- YouTube: 622 files (dominant — channels: ai_news_strategy_daily_nate_b 41, theo_t3_gg 34, the_ai_daily_brief 32, wes_roth 30, dylan_davis 23, a16z 19, david_shapiro 16...)
- X threads: 20 files
- Website articles: 5 files (Paul Graham, Anthropic engineering blog, cognition.ai, humanlayer, lucumr)
- Other: 1

**Date range of sources**: 2002-02-01 (Paul Graham "Taste for Makers") through 2026-01-24 (latest in range).

**SOURCE near-dupe risk**: The extraction files reference SOURCE-named files that do NOT appear in this 00001-03000 range. No extraction-vs-source near-dupe pairs found in this range.

**Within-extraction near-dupes**: No two extraction files reference the same source. Each source appears exactly once. No crush candidates within this cluster.

## CLUSTER I — Syncrescendence Internal: Agent Offices, Tasks, Confirms

**Description**: Internal operational files of the Syncrescendence multi-agent system: agent INIT.md files, Memory files per agent, TASK files, CONFIRM receipts, RESULT receipts, HANDOFF files, and deferred commitment logs.

### Sub-groups:

**Agent Office Files (with EMERGENCY MODE header prepended):**
- `00303.md` — Adjudicator Office INIT.md
- `00304.md` — Adjudicator Memory

- `00322.md` — Cartographer Office INIT.md
- `00323.md` — Cartographer Memory
- `00332.md` — Commander Office INIT.md
- `00365.md` — Psyche Office INIT.md
- `00366.md` — Psyche Memory

Note: All 9 have the `⚠️ EMERGENCY MODE (CC30) — SOVEREIGN DIRECTIVE ⚠️` header prepended. This is a state header, not the file's actual content.

**TASK files:**
00302.md, 00307.md, 00308.md, 00309.md, 00310.md, 00311.md, 00318.md, 00319.md, 00320.md, 00321.md, 00329.md, 00330.md, 00331.md, 00363.md, 00364.md

**CONFIRM files (adjudicator, ajna, cartographer, commander, psyche — 2026-02-07 through 2026-02-22):**
00551.md through 00664.md (large block, ~100 files)

**RESULT files:**
00316.md, 00317.md, 00369.md, 00370.md, 00371.md

**HANDOFF:**
00350.md — HANDOFF Commander Council 43

**CONFIRMED CRUSH CANDIDATES within Cluster I:**

**Group 1 — Exact title survivors (TASK):**
- `00308.md`, `00318.md`, `00363.md` — all titled "TASK-20260211-install-hf-last-signal-skills"
- Verify: 00308 (1,398 bytes), 00318 (1,444 bytes) — slight byte difference
- VERDICT: Compare content before crushing. Likely same task file copied across agents' inboxes. **Retain one authoritative copy, crush the others.**

**Group 2 — Exact title survivors (TASK):**
- `00311.md` — "TASK: Idle health report" (800 bytes)
- `00321.md` — "TASK: Idle health report" (693 bytes)
- Different byte counts suggest different instances (different dates/content). Check before crushing.

**Group 3 — Exact title survivors (CONFIRM):**
- `00362.md` — "CONFIRM-ajna-20260211-install-hf-last-signal-skills" (1,101 bytes)
- `00608.md` — "CONFIRM-ajna-20260211-install-hf-last-signal-skills" (637 bytes)
- VERDICT: Likely same confirm copied to different locations. **Crush shorter one (00608.md)** after verifying content.

**Group 4 — Exact title survivors (CONFIRM):**
- `00328.md` — "CONFIRM-psyche-20260212-codex_upgrade_and_smoke_test" (385 bytes)
- `00650.md` — "CONFIRM-psyche-20260212-codex_upgrade_and_smoke_test" (207 bytes)
- VERDICT: Shorter is likely stub/receipt, longer is fuller confirm. **Crush shorter (00650.md)** after verifying.

**Pattern — Repeated DC followup confirms (same task, different dates, all FAILED):**
These are NOT duplicates — they are retry attempts that all resulted in rate-limit failures:
- 00586.md (2026-02-19, COMPLETE), 00591.md (2026-02-20, FAILED rate-limit), 00595.md (2026-02-21, FAILED), 00600.md (2026-02-22, FAILED) — for DC-002
- Same 4-day retry pattern for DC-003, DC-004, DC-013
- VERDICT: Different dates, different statuses. Keep all — they are an operational record, not duplicates.

---

## CLUSTER J — Syncrescendence Internal: CLARESCENCE Documents

**Description**: Strategic clarification documents generated during constellation sessions. CLARESCE-DIGEST series (A–J, plus MASTER), plus individual CLARESCENCE topic files.

Plus individual CLARESCENCE files: 00477.md–00533.md (topic-specific clarescence documents)

**Near-dupe pairs:**
- `00492.md` — "CLARESCENCE: awesome-openclaw ecosystem appropriation"
- `00493.md` — "CLARESCENCE: awesome-openclaw Ecosystem (Secondary Pass)"
- VERDICT: Sequential passes of same topic — not duplicates, each captures a different pass. Keep both.

---

## CLUSTER K — Syncrescendence Internal: ARCH/REF/DYN State Files

**Description**: Architecture specs, reference documents, dynamic state files, decision logs, canon digests, and deployment infrastructure docs.

### Files (sample):

00916.md–00948.md (REF-* files)

**CONFIRMED CRUSH CANDIDATE:**

**ROSETTA STONE near-duplicate:**
- `00539.md` — "ROSETTA STONE: Syncrescendent <> Community Terminology" v2.7.0 (117,923 bytes)
- `00940.md` — "ROSETTA STONE: Syncrescendent <> Community Terminology" v2.7.0 (119,250 bytes)
- Both are version 2.7.0, generated 2026-02-16, same source metadata
- DIFFERENCE: 00940 has an additional "Category 25: Certescence Instruments (1 term)" section with Term 312 (Reviewtrospective, CC38) that 00539 lacks — 00940 is the MORE COMPLETE version
- VERDICT: **Crush 00539.md** (older, missing Term 312 section). Retain 00940.md.

- `00355.md` — The question prompts (bare text: "Explain Palantir's ontology", follow-ups) [1,002 bytes]
- `00360.md` — Second question prompt variant (prosumer angle) [944 bytes]
- `00351.md` — Response A: Palantir Ontology foundational explanation [30,281 bytes]
- `00352.md` — Response B: Palantir Ontology as architectural primitive [41,325 bytes]
- `00353.md` — Response C: "The Semantic Substrate of the Enterprise" [21,685 bytes]
- `00354.md` — Response D: Synthesis of architecture and operational intelligence [21,180 bytes]
- `00356.md` — Response E: Three-essence distillation [21,301 bytes]
- `00357.md` — Response F: Closest analogues (nothing replicates full commitment) [26,791 bytes]
- `00358.md` — Response G: "C3 AI is the closest" [17,871 bytes]
- `00359.md` — Response H: DataWalk and d.AP as closest analogues [17,296 bytes]

### Same vs different:
The "what is Palantir Ontology" responses (00351–00356) all answer the same core question but from different angles and with different depths. These are SAME-TOPIC but NOT same-content.
The "closest analogues" responses (00357–00359) all answer the same sub-question. Some overlap but each emphasizes a different alternative.

### CRUSH CANDIDATES within Cluster P:
- `00357.md`, `00358.md`, `00359.md` — three answers to "what's closest to Palantir Ontology?" — different AIs, different conclusions (C3 AI vs DataWalk vs "nothing fully replicates"). VERDICT: Genuinely different answers. Keep all.
- `00355.md` and `00360.md` are question prompts — keep as context anchors.

## ADDITIONAL FINDINGS: TITLE APPEARING MULTIPLE TIMES

Files where the title/content appears 2–3 times (survivors from the dedup pass):

| Title | Files | Bytes | Verdict |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| "Call Your OpenClaw over the phone using ElevenLabs Agents" | 00111.md (5,088), 00137.md (5,204) | near-identical | CRUSH 00111.md |
| "TASK-20260211-install-hf-last-signal-skills" | 00308.md (1,398), 00318.md (1,444), 00363.md | slight differences | Compare; crush redundant copies |
| "TASK: Idle health report" | 00311.md (800), 00321.md (693) | size difference | Compare content; likely different instances |
| "ROSETTA STONE: Syncrescendent <> Community Terminology" | 00539.md (117,923), 00940.md (119,250) | 00940 has extra section | CRUSH 00539.md |
| "CONFIRM-ajna-20260211-install-hf-last-signal-skills" | 00362.md (1,101), 00608.md (637) | size difference | CRUSH 00608.md |
| "CONFIRM-psyche-20260212-codex_upgrade_and_smoke_test" | 00328.md (385), 00650.md (207) | size difference | CRUSH 00650.md |
| "🔑 openclaw + minimax = $14/month" | 00123.md (22,766), 00124.md (12,949) | same article, 00124 is truncated | CRUSH 00124.md |
| "⚠️ EMERGENCY MODE (CC30)" (as title) | 00303, 00304, 00312, 00313, 00322, 00323, 00332, 00365, 00366, 00399, 00730, 00812, 00813, 00814 | emergency header prepended to 14 different docs | NOT duplicates — emergency header on different underlying docs |

## FINDINGS: EXTRACTION FILES AND SOURCE DOCUMENT PAIRING

648 extraction files (`# Extraction:` header) exist in range 01059–03000. Every extraction file references a `SOURCE-{date}-{channel}-{title}.md` file via the `**Source**:` field.

**Key finding**: None of the referenced SOURCE files exist in the 00001–03000 range. The SOURCE files were either:
1. Stored in a different naming convention elsewhere in the corpus (beyond 03000)
2. Deleted in a prior dedup pass
3. Never numbered as .md files in the corpus

This means there are NO extraction-vs-source near-dupe pairs within this range. The extraction files stand alone.

**Within the extraction block, no two files reference the same source.** Each source has exactly one extraction file. No within-cluster crush candidates.

## FINDINGS: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT RENAISSANCE NEAR-DUPE

- `00180.md` — "Software Development Renaissance: OpenAI's Agentic Development Strategy" (4,291 bytes)
- `00181.md` — "Software Development Renaissance: OpenAI's Approach to Agentic Development" (4,209 bytes)

These are the same OpenAI blog post captured twice with slightly different title renderings. The content is nearly identical (same paragraphs, same structure) with minor formatting differences (00180 has a bolded opening sentence, 00181 does not; 00180 has "Goals for March 31st" section that appears slightly earlier). **CRUSH 00181.md** (slightly smaller, "Strategy" version in 00180 is the original title).

---

## FINDINGS: OBSIDIAN + CLAUDE CODE NEAR-DUPE PAIR

- `00031.md` — "obsidian + claude code 101"
- `00047.md` — "Obsidian & Claude Code 101: Context Engineering"

These warrant a full content comparison — title similarity suggests they may be the same article with minor reformatting or the same author's two different articles in the "101" series.

---

## SUMMARY: CONFIRMED CRUSH CANDIDATES

| File to Crush | Keep Instead | Reason |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| `00111.md` | `00124.md` correction: keep `00137.md` | Exact title duplicate; 00137 is slightly longer/more complete |
| `00124.md` | `00123.md` | Same article; 00123 is longer and more complete |
| `00181.md` | `00180.md` | Same OpenAI article, near-identical content |
| `00539.md` | `00940.md` | ROSETTA STONE: 00940 has additional Term 312 section that 00539 lacks |
| `00608.md` | `00362.md` | Same CONFIRM, 00608 is shorter/stub version |
| `00650.md` | `00328.md` | Same CONFIRM, 00650 is shorter/stub version |
| `00900.md` | `00899.md` | 00900 is labeled "old"; 00899 is current synthesis |

### Verify Before Crushing (need content diff):
- `00308.md` vs `00318.md` vs `00363.md` (all TASK-20260211-install-hf-last-signal-skills) — compare to find authoritative copy
- `00311.md` vs `00321.md` (both TASK: Idle health report) — compare dates/content
- `00031.md` vs `00047.md` (obsidian + claude code 101) — may be different articles in same series

## NOTABLE NON-DUPLICATES (Similar Titles, Different Content)

These pairs look like dupes from titles alone but are genuinely distinct:

| Pair | Why Different |
|------|--------------|
| 00081.md "20 More Clawdbot Setups" vs 00136.md "10 More Clawdbot Setups" | Different articles in same series (different count, different setups) |
| 00192.md vs 00217.md (Agent Teams guides) | Different authors/approaches (official vs reverse-engineered) |
| 00351–00356.md (Palantir Ontology) | Same question, different LLM responses — different perspectives, not duplicates |
| 00357–00359.md (Palantir closest analogue) | Three different AI answers, each names a different competitor |
| 00111.md vs 00197.md (phone calls) | Different direction: 00111 = you call OpenClaw; 00197 = OpenClaw calls you |
| 00308.md/00318.md/00363.md | May be same task distributed across agent inboxes — check before crushing |
| DC followup CONFIRMs (00586–00603) | Same task attempted on different dates; FAILED/COMPLETE status differs — operational record |

*End of analysis. Files scanned: 1,440. Total confirmed crush candidates: 7 files. Probable additional crushes pending content verification: 3–5 files.*
