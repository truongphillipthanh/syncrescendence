What's really happening with the AI industry's biggest moves this week? The common story is that AGI is distant speculation—but the reality is more complicated when the leaders of Anthropic and DeepMind publicly agree it's arriving faster than most outsiders expect.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on the developments reshaping AI strategy right now:

 • Why XAI closed $20 billion despite active regulatory probes in five countries
 • What Dario Amodei and Demis Hassabis actually disagree about on AI jobs
 • How Apple's Gemini deal signals a major loss for OpenAI's distribution play
 • Where the AI coding tools market is fragmenting between engineers and non-technical users

For operators and builders watching the AI labor market, the Hassabis framing may prove more durable—AI supercharges the humans who master the remaining 5% machines can't touch.
