How does the 3mm-thick sheet of cells on the surface of our brain give rise to everything we consider human intelligence? In this video we explore one of the most compelling answers to that question: Jeff Hawkins' "Thousand Brains Theory" and the neurobiology behind cortical columns.  We will see how every cortical column is a complete sensorimotor system,  discuss all six neuronal layers of the cortex to see how they work together to build predictive models of the world through a constant loop of sensation, movement, and consensus voting.
