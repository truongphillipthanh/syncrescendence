# If You're Still Applying to Jobs, Read This

## Core Principles

Companies don't hire the most qualified person. They hire who makes the decision feel easiest.

The recruiting game is rigged - but not in the way you think.

I've hired over 200 employees across three companies and reviewed over 100,000 resumes. Here's what actually happens on the other side of the table.

After reviewing thousands of resumes, you start to see patterns. They blur together - same schools, same companies, same bullet points. 90% of resumes reviewed are discarded in the first 3 seconds. But every now and then, someone does something different.

They don't just apply. They show up with work already done. Teardowns of our product, prototypes that solve niche problems, or redesigns without us ever asking.

These people skip the line. Not because they're gaming the system, but because they've already demonstrated the initiative actually being hired for.

Most candidates ask, "How do I get the job?" But the ones who win ask, "How can I prove myself before they ever meet me?"

This article is about the second question. The intricacies and initiatives have led to first hires across multiple companies. It covers the specific tips, strategies, and examples from employees to showcase how to land any job.

## Effort Comes Before the Application

Most people think the job search starts when you hit "submit."

They focus on the outputs:

- Polished resume
- Optimized LinkedIn
- Practiced interview answers
- Tailored cover letter

But those are just artifacts. They drive no real value to those employing you, and recruiting becomes a game of how well one can market themselves instead of how well one can prove themselves. People attach their effort to the application and then wonder why it blends in with everyone else.

By the time you're applying, the game is already over. You either have something to show, or you're just another resume making promises.

The application isn't the beginning. It's the reveal.

## "Application" Is the Wrong Word

Applying to something gives off the connotation that you are requesting something from the employer.

But when looking at people who get hired immediately, that's not what they're doing. They're not applying. They continue to work - except now they point it at a specific company.

Full product recommendations have been sent through email. Complete mockups of new features were made before they were hired. There's a multitude of examples of employees hired directly who used this strategy:

- A 20-year-old who became one of my best engineers didn't submit an application. He shipped a fully functioning feature in one weekend.
- One of my best designers didn't send a resume. She sent a teardown of Wispr's product and all the design changes she would make.
- My first GTM hire didn't ask for an interview. He closed three deals and championed Wispr at other companies he worked at.

When you look at it this way, the "application" isn't anything new because they had already started building for the company. This makes it much easier to hire them because you can already envision them as part of the team.

That's the reframe. You're not asking to be evaluated. You're giving them another sample. Another data point. More proof of how you think, how you operate, and how you're like to work with.

## Three Archetypes of Successful Candidates

### 1. The Builder

**Primary differentiator:** making things exist.

These people can't help but ship. They see a problem, and their instinct is to solve it - not talk about it, not plan it, not ask for permission. Just build.

They thrive on:

- Starting from scratch
- Working fast under pressure
- Turning ideas into something real
- Showing instead of telling

They don't need a job description to start working. They need a problem.

This approach works especially well for:

- Engineers
- Designers
- Writers
- Anyone who makes things

**Example:** The 20-year-old who DM'd was a builder.

He didn't send a resume. He didn't ask for an interview. He showed up on a Saturday, heard about a project that needed doing, and said "I'll start now."

By Sunday morning, he texted, "Tanay, I just pulled an all-nighter. It's done."

Thousands of lines of code. A fully functioning feature. In 48 hours.

I see a lot of candidates with impressive backgrounds. Staff engineers from Uber. Principal scientists from Meta. Ten, twenty years of experience. That's fine, but it still leaves questions. I don't know how they work day to day. I don't know how they handle ambiguity. I don't know what they're like when there's no roadmap.

Shipping something answers all of that instantly. It shows how someone thinks, how they move, and what they do when no one's telling them what to do. That's a builder.

### 2. The Analyst

**Primary differentiator:** understanding how things work.

These people are obsessed with systems. They look at a product, a company, a process - and they can't help but pull it apart. They want to know what's working, what's broken, and what everyone else is missing.

They thrive on:

- Finding inefficiencies others overlook
- Seeing patterns across complex systems
- Forming strong opinions backed by evidence
- Communicating what they see with clarity

They don't need to be asked to evaluate something. They're already doing it.

This approach works especially well for:

- Product managers
- Designers
- Strategists
- Consultants
- Operations people

**Example:** The designer who reached out was an analyst.

She didn't send a resume. She didn't ask for a portfolio review. She sent a complete teardown of our product - a deck showing what was broken, why it was broken, and how she'd fix it. Unprompted. Just sent it over.

I see a lot of portfolios. Most of them show what someone made at their last job. That's fine, but it doesn't tell much. I don't know what constraints they were under. I don't know if the good ideas were theirs. I don't know how they think.

A teardown shows exactly how someone thinks. It shows what they notice, what bothers them, and what they'd prioritize. It shows their taste. And when the teardown is about your own product, it answers the only question that actually matters: can this person make us better?

She didn't just demonstrate skill. She demonstrated that she'd been paying attention specifically. She expressed her opinions about our work. She wasn't simply distributing work to fifty companies and hoping for a positive response.

That's an analyst.

### 3. The Operator

**Primary differentiator:** making things happen.

These people don't just talk about results. They create them. They're wired to move - to find the path, work the problem, and close the gap between "idea" and "done."

They thrive on:

- Building relationships that lead to outcomes
- Navigating ambiguity without a playbook
- Creating momentum where there was none
- Delivering results before being asked

They don't need a title to start driving outcomes. They just need a target.

This approach works especially well for:

- Salespeople
- Business development
- Founders
- GTM roles
- Anyone who moves deals forward

**Example:** The GTM hire who reached out was an operator.

He didn't send a resume. He didn't ask for an interview. He started selling for us - as a stranger. He'd become a champion for Wispr at companies he already knew. Introduced us to buyers. Ran the conversations. Closed three enterprise deals. Then he reached out and said, "If I join you, I can do a lot more."

When someone closes deals before they're hired, the guessing is over. You're not evaluating potential. You're looking at results - results for your company, with your product, in real time. There's no stronger signal.

He also demonstrated something harder to measure: commitment. He didn't hedge his bets across a hundred applications. He picked us. Went all in. Did the work before there was any guarantee it would pay off. That kind of conviction is rare. And it's almost impossible to fake.

That's an operator.

## Do What Others Can't

These people are not playing a different game than everyone else. They're just playing it earlier.

Most people wait. They wait for the job posting. They wait for the interview. They wait for someone to ask them to prove themselves. And then they wonder why they can't seem to stand out.

But standing out isn't about being louder. It's about showing up before you're asked.

That's the shift. You stop asking "how do I get this job?" and start asking "how do I make this decision obvious?"

When people ask how to get hired, they're usually looking for tactics. Better resume formats. Interview frameworks. Ways to optimize the application.

But when you work directly for the company, something changes. You're no longer hoping to be chosen. You're no longer competing with a thousand other resumes in a pile. You're no longer asking for permission.

You're just working. And then, at some point, you point the work at a company you want to join.

Most people won't do this. They'll read this and think it sounds like a lot of effort. They'll go back to tweaking their resume and refreshing their inbox.

Good.

That's what makes it work. The bar is low because almost no one plays this way. Which means if you actually do - if you actually build something, ship something, prove something before anyone asks - you're not competing anymore.

You've already won.
