# The Time Savings Era of AI is Over
![Article header image](Description: A vibrant, illustrative graphic featuring a humanoid robot with a gray beard and white/blue coloring in a centered meditative position with legs crossed. The robot wears a yellow/gold circular frame around its torso. Surrounding the figure on a teal background are 12+ laptop and computer monitors arranged in a radial pattern, with red crabs/crayfish positioned throughout the composition. The art style is modern, colorful, and carries a tech-meets-nature aesthetic with a dominant color palette of teal, coral orange, and light blue.)
## TL;DR
People including non-engineers are vibe coding more; time savings isn't the most common value category for AI impact anymore; and the value people are getting from AI is increasing even more than their usage.
## Main Body
When we did our [AI ROI Study](https://aidbintel.com/research) at the end of last year, saving time was definitively the most common value proposition of AI use cases. In our January AIDB Intel - AI Usage Pulse Survey, however, it dropped to 3rd place -- suggesting people are moving up the value chain for AI.
We also saw a massive uptick in coding as the primary use case, including for non-coders. **~50% of non engineer/non-IT AI users** who said they vibe code **identified coding as their most important use case.**
### System Visualization
![System update graphic](Description: A retro-style green terminal/system interface graphic styled like a 1980s computer display. The graphic shows "SYSTEM UPDATE 2026: THE END OF THE TIME-SAVINGS ERA" at the top with a scrolling data visualization below. Contains the following key elements and statistics:
- EVOLUTION OF VALUE section showing TIME SAVINGS DROPPED TO 3RD PLACE and THE 12-POINT VALUE PREMIUM
- INCREASED OUTPUT section with 71% INCREASED AI USAGE and 83% INCREASED VALUE DESPITE INCREASED USAGE
- MODEL USAGE MATRIX (PRIMARY CHOICES) showing CLAUDE, CHATGPT, and GEMINI with "POWER USERS MANAGE PORTFOLIOS, AVERAGE: 3.5 MODELS USED"
- THE RISE OF THE BUILDER section: "69% OF USERS ARE 'VIBE CODING'"
- Multi-model usage illustration with a builder/developer figure at a computer
- THE AGENTIC THRESHOLD IS CROSSED section: "37.6% NOW DEPLOY AUTONOMOUS AGENTS, NEW DEPLOYMENT TRAJECTORY"
- C-SUITE LEADS AGENTIC ADOPTION section: "EXECUTIVES: HIGHEST AGENTIC USAGE RATE AT 57%"

## Other Interesting Stats
**+12 point value premium.** Between Dec and Jan, 71% reported increased AI usage, and 83% reported increased AI value. Even people who weren't using it more were getting more out of it.
**~38% of people are deploying agentic use cases now** (another massive jump up from what we saw in the ROI Survey)
**Execs were the highest title category when it came to agent usage**, with **57% reporting agentic use cases.** This means growth across the org is likely as they push their teams to evolve.
**ChatGPT was the most broadly used model but Claude was the #1 primary choice for 46% of users.**
## Methodology Note
This is a voluntary survey of my [@AIDailyBrief](https://x.com/@AIDailyBrief) audience -- meaning this is VERY forward looking and probably representing a pretty advanced band of AI users. It basically models where AI will be for other users in 3-6 months IMO.
