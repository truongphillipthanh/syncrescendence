PASS Canon35210MetahumanismFramework:
    sutra: "The @Metahumanism Framework provides a philosophical foundation for Syncrescendence, integrating diverse insights into human development."
    gloss:
        The @Metahumanism Framework serves as Syncrescendence's philosophical foundation, unifying belief systems analysis, epistemology, volition studies, spiritual traditions, causation theory, and phenomenology. It is a meta-framework, not a belief system, for understanding and integrating various worldviews.
end

PASS TranscendenceRingLunarPhilosophical:
    sutra: "This framework is a canonical philosophical integration within the Transcendence Ring Lunar's WISDOM chain."
    gloss:
        This @Metahumanism Framework (CON) is canonical, derived from 920K of research, and stands as a philosophical integration within the Transcendence Ring Lunar's WISDOM chain, per parent CANON-35200.
end

PASS Purpose:
    sutra: "The framework unifies diverse insights into a coherent worldview for post-conventional human development."
    gloss:
        @Metahumanism Framework (CON) provides Syncrescendence's philosophical foundation, integrating belief systems, epistemology, volition, spiritual traditions, causation, and phenomenology to enable human development beyond conventional limits. It's a meta-framework for understanding and integrating worldviews, not a belief system.
end

PASS PartIBeliefSystems:
    sutra: "The Belief Systems Framework defines beliefs as dynamic, self-referential, multi-layered, semiotic consciousness structures."
    gloss:
        Beliefs are constitutive structures of consciousness, dynamic, self-referential, multi-layered, and semiotic. The @Meta-Dialectical Approach expands on traditional dialectics (Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis) to Thesis → Self-Referential Feedback → Infinite Expansion, recognizing beliefs evolve through recursive iteration. Taxonomies highlight tensions: Political (Individual ↔ Collective), Economic (Planning ↔ Market), Epistemological (Empiricism ↔ Rationalism). Beliefs are phenomenologically embodied, acting as perceptual filters and pre-reflective intuitions.
end

PASS CoreRecognition:
    sutra: "Belief systems profoundly shape consciousness, acting as dynamic, self-referential, multi-layered, and semiotic architectures."
    gloss:
        Belief systems are constitutive structures of consciousness, dynamically adapting, self-referential, multi-layered, and semiotic. They are not static propositions but evolving architectures determining experience and meaning.
end

PASS MetadialecticalApproach:
    sutra: "Meta-dialectics expands traditional dialectics, using recursive iteration for infinite expansion rather than synthesis."
    gloss:
        @Meta-Dialectical Approach (CON) redefines dialectics from Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis to Thesis → Self-Referential Feedback → Infinite Expansion. This reflects how belief systems expand via recursive iteration, maintaining internal contradictions while evolving.
end

PASS CoreDialecticalTaxonomies:
    sutra: "Core taxonomies address fundamental tensions in political, economic, and epistemological domains."
    gloss:
        Core Dialectical Taxonomies identify key tensions: Political (Individual ↔ Collective); Economic (Planning ↔ Market); Epistemological (Empiricism ↔ Rationalism).
end

PASS PhenomenologicalEmbodiment:
    sutra: "Beliefs become embodied filters, generating affective resonance and manifesting as pre-reflective intuitions."
    gloss:
        Belief systems are embodied modes of being, acting as perceptual filters, generating characteristic affective resonance, manifesting as bodily hexis, and internalizing as pre-reflective intuitions. Beliefs are felt, not just thought.

end

PASS EmergenceAndDownwardCausation:
    sutra: "Complex systems exhibit upward, downward, lateral, and circular causation, including feedback loops."
    gloss:
        Complex systems display upward causation (parts → whole), downward causation (whole → parts), lateral causation (part → part), and circular causation (feedback loops).
end

PASS ImplicationsForAgency:
    sutra: "Human agency is driven by imagined futures, distinguishing it as a form of final causation."
    gloss:
        Human agency operates via final causation, driven by imagined futures, differentiating intentional action from mechanical movement.
end
