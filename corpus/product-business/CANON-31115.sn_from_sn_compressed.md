    gloss:
        @Acumen IIC Implementation (WF): Personal intelligence-mediated curation engine. Operational status: 2-3 weeks from start to functional @Daily Intelligence Cycle (PROTO).
        
        Core teleology: Strategic reconnaissance maintaining perceptual understanding of civilizational developments across domains. Three capabilities: @signal qualification (1-10 consumption score), @compression intelligence (determine medium/depth ratio), @strategic contextualization (position within Syncrescendent framework).
        
        Dual-stream architecture: Automated intake (80%) via overnight AI processing; serendipitous stream (20%) via evening intentional browsing. Both feed unified queue with equal rigor—no favorites bias.
        
        Daily cycle: Evening browsing → overnight AI processing → 6 AM brief generation → 8 AM strategic review (15-30 min) → targeted consumption per recommendations → evening cycle repeats.
        
        Weekly synthesis: Saturday 4-6 hours. Review Tier 1-2 content, cross-domain pattern detection, framework development, content ideation.
        
        Time investment: Daily 30-60 min reconnaissance. Weekly 4-6 hours synthesis. Monthly 2-3 hours archaeological integration. Quarterly 4-5 hours strategic recalibration.

Layer 4 (@Computational Intelligence) critical: Claude Project "Acumen IIC Intelligence Engine" with custom instructions, daily automation at 6 AM. Layer 5 (@Content Platforms): YouTube (primary), X/Twitter (discourse), Substack (long-form), ArXiv (research). Layer 7 (@Cross-IIC Integration): handoff protocols to Coherence/Efficacy/Mastery/Transcendence.
        
        Platform architecture: YouTube—80-120 subscriptions organized by abstraction gradient (Foundations → Paradigm → Civilizational). X/Twitter—4 lists (Primary Sources ~30, Expert Synthesizers ~20, Informed Commentary ~15, Horizon Scanning ~10). Zero public engagement (pure reconnaissance). Substack—Tier 1 (read within 48h), Tier 2 (batch quarterly), Tier 3 (reference). ArXiv—keyword alerts, AI-assisted summarization (90% papers get Claude summary only; 9% active skimming; 1% full analysis).
        
        Qualification system: @Recommendation Scoring System (MET) across 5 dimensions: Signal Density (1-10), Source Proximity (1-5 frontier-to-tertiary), Temporal Relevance (1-5 evergreen-to-real-time), Novelty (1-5 redundant-to-paradigm-shift), Actionability (1-5 entertainment-to-immediate-implementation). Composite formula yields Tier assignment (70+: Tier 1 immediate, 50-69: Tier 2 weekly, <50: archive/skip).

Tier 3 Technical Implementation (sentdex, Code Emporium, DIBEOS). Tier 4 Industry & Application (All-In Podcast, Bloomberg Technology, Asianometry). Tier 5 Paradigm Interviews (Dwarkesh Patel, Lex Fridman, Machine Learning Street Talk). Tier 6 Real-Time Aggregation (Wes Roth, Matthew Berman, AI Daily Brief). Tier 7 Civilizational Scale (Peter Diamandis, ARK Invest, Hans Nelson).
        
        Notifications: Frontier labs (breaking announcements). Paradigm interviews (Dwarkesh, Lex). Occasional (Wes Roth, Matthew Berman). None others (consume via daily reconnaissance). Rationale: Interrupt only for paradigm shifts or breaking developments.
        
        Playlists: Organize by four dimensions: Abstraction (Foundations/Research/Technical/Applied/Paradigm/Civilizational), Modality (Visual-Heavy/Audio-Suitable/Interactive), Cadence (Real-Time/Weekly/Monthly/Evergreen), Signal Fidelity (Primary/Expert-Synthesis/Informed-Commentary/Aggregation). Name combinations: "Research-Audio-Weekly-Expert."
        
        @Qualification Workflow (Critical Innovation): Every flagged video gets transcript extracted, submitted to Claude: "Signal Density Score (1-10), Novelty Assessment (new vs rehash), Consumption Recommendation (Must Watch/Listen/Extract/Skip), Strategic Relevance (Syncrescendent positioning), Key Claims (3-5 bullets), Compression Summary (100-200 words)." Output structured JSON feeds daily brief. Efficiency: 3-hour podcast qualified in 2 minutes.

Expert Synthesizers (~20 accounts—technical bloggers with depth, independent analysts, domain experts). Informed Commentary (~15 accounts—journalists with technical literacy, public researchers, industry observers). Horizon Scanning (~10 accounts—contrarians, adjacent domain experts, wildcard follows).
        
        Notifications: Mobile only to Primary Sources (max 10 critical accounts: Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Andrej Karpathy, OpenAI, AnthropicAI). Desktop/Email: none (batch processing). Rationale: Only interrupt for immediate strategic shifts.
        
        @Bookmarking Workflow: Flag high-signal content immediately. Weekly review Saturday: categorize by Chain Affinity, Phase Relevance, Action Type. Export to external system (Notion/Obsidian) for permanent storage. Clear bookmarks after processing. Naming convention: Quote-tweet to self with tags: "📊 THREAD → Coherence [Topic]," "🔬 RESEARCH → Acumen [Paper]," "🛠 TOOL → Efficacy [Name]," "🌐 META → Transcendence [Pattern]."
        
        Daily reconnaissance: Morning (15-20 min) Primary Sources scan for breaking announcements, mental note of discourse heat. Evening (20-30 min) Expert Synthesizers + Commentary lists look for synthesis threads explaining developments, Horizon Scanning for contrarian takes.
        
        Zero-engagement policy (Critical): No replies, quotes, likes, retweets, DMs. Maintains pure reconnaissance signal. Private quote-tweets to self for organization (set to "Only people you mention"). Rationale: Public engagement exposes account, trains algorithm toward virality over signal, creates social pressure to continue engaging.

        @Heat Mapping (TOOL): Daily automated in brief (keyword frequency, sentiment, convergence tracking). Weekly synthesis deep analysis: identify 5-7 recurring themes, map discourse trajectory day-by-day, predict next week's developments, strategic positioning opportunities. Monthly visualization showing topic evolution. Strategic uses: content ideation (write about high-heat topics), framework development (new concepts need Coherence integration), resource allocation (rising heat deserves deeper investigation), positioning (identify contrarian opportunities).

PASS ERecommendationScoringSystem:
    sutra: "Five-dimensional scoring: Signal Density, Source Proximity, Temporal Relevance, Novelty, Actionability"
    gloss:
        @Recommendation Scoring System (MET): Dimensions—Signal Density (1-10 low-high), Source Proximity (1-5 tertiary-frontier), Temporal Relevance (1-5 evergreen-real-time), Novelty (1-5 redundant-paradigm-shift), Actionability (1-5 entertainment-immediate-implementation). Composite formula: (Signal×2) + (Proximity×1.5) + (Temporal×1) + (Novelty×2) + (Actionability×1.5) = score (max 95, min 8). Thresholds: 70+: Tier 1 (immediate), 50-69: Tier 2 (weekly queue), 30-49: Tier 3 (archive), <30: skip. Example: Dwarkesh interview with Ilya (Signal 9, Proximity 4, Temporal 3, Novelty 5, Actionability 4) = 43 score = Tier 2 (queue for Saturday synthesis, listen at 2x, take notes, forward transcript to Coherence IIC).
