# Thread: Gas Town Post Commentary

## Post 1

got nerdsniped into finally reading the original Gas Town post and wow. it's beautiful and terrifying and hilarious and probably a glimpse at the future that will feel normal in 6 months.

(Description: Embedded screenshot panels from the Gas Town post showing a technical discussion about orchestration and agent architecture:

**Panel 1 (Top-Left):**
"orchestrates for agents. I went up onstage at multiple events and described my vision for the orchestrator. I went everywhere, to everyone.

"It will be like kubernetes, but for agents," I said.

"It will have to have multiple levels of agents orchestrating other agents," I said.

Gas Town management is called a Rig. Some roles (Witness, Polecats, Refinery, Crew) are per-rig, while others (Mayor, Deacon, Dogs) are town-level roles. `gt rig add` and related commands manage your rig within the Gas Town harness. Rigs are easy to add and remove.

The Overseer: That's you, Human. The"

**Panel 2 (Top-Right):**
"Gas Town uses tmux as its primary CI. I had to learn tmux. It was easier than I thought it would be, and way more useful. 3 weeks in, and I love tmux. You will have to learn a bit of tmux. Or, you can wait until someone writes a better UI for Gas Town. Better UIs will come. But tmux is what you have for now. And it's worth learning.

I would have to hag the agent to finish, and they would always skip steps.

With molecules, the idea was, make 20 beads for the release steps, chain them together in the right order, and make the agent walk the chain, one issue at a time. One added benefit is that it produces an activity feed automatically, as they claim and close issues.")

dude you gotta try the Disco Stu method. the Gil Gunderson plugin goes so hard. bro have you checked out the Bumblebee Man skill. everything changed once i started using the Jasper Beardly prompt. the Freddy Quimby MCP is nuts bro. the Todd Flanders CLI might actually be AGI

this is a different beast. it's like watching the Kanye West TLOP rollout vs hyping up the TikTok song of the month
