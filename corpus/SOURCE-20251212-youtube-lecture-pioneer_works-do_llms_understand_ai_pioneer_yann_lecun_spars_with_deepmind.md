## Description (no transcript available)

To cut through the noise around AI, we brought in two experts shaping the field: Adam Brown and Yann LeCun.

For the latest episode of Scientific Controversies, computer science pioneer Yann LeCun and Google DeepMind research lead Adam Brown joined our Director of Sciences Janna Levin in conversation. A Turing Award winner, Yann Lecun is the chief architect behind deep learning and convolutional neural networks. Adam Brown is a research scientist and group lead on Gemini, Google DeepMind’s large language model, and has helped drive the astonishing progress of these AI systems as they have evolved from babbling preschoolers to International Math Olympiad gold medallists. 

Together, the trio explored how machines do what they’re doing, and if they’re actually able to think. 

This project is supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Program in Public Understanding of Science and Technology, bridging the two cultures of science and the arts.
