Joe Hudson joins Dr. K (@H@HealthyGamerGGand Charlie Houpert (@Cha@Charismaoncommandr a conversation that goes places most charisma content never touches. They explore why the "sleazy" version of charisma — learned behaviors, tactics, techniques — never lasts more than months. And why the real thing comes from: internal unity, welcoming your emotions, and dissolving the parts of yourself that are at war.

What's fascinating is watching 3 people arrive at the same place from completely different directions — Joe through emotional work and self-inquiry, Dr. K through neuroscience and Eastern spirituality, Charlie through 20 years of studying presence.

What you'll explore:
• Why "becoming somebody to be loved" means you never actually get loved
• The difference between managing your emotions and welcoming them
• How your inner critic is already charismatic
• Why competence doesn't lead to confidence — surviving failure does
• The emptiness that makes real connection possible
