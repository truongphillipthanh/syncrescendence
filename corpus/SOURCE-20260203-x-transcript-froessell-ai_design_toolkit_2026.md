## Summary

A senior product designer's honest breakdown of AI design tools across a 6-phase creative workflow. Key insight: no single perfect tool — right tool at right stage. Distinguishes between side project workflows (where AI shines most) and enterprise design work (established systems, tokens, stakeholders).

## Context

Author works in two contexts:
1. **Enterprise**: Senior product designer at large ecommerce. Design systems, token pipelines → GitLab, stakeholder alignment.
2. **Side projects**: Greenfield, experimental, move fast, break things.

AI workflows look completely different depending on which hat.

## The 6-Phase Workflow

### Ideation → Iteration → Build → Polish → Content → Motion

> "Trying to use one tool for everything is like editing video in Photoshop. You can, but why would you?"

### Phase 1: Quick Concepts
**Tools**: v0.app, Superdesign.dev, Variant.ai, aura.build

- Prompt-based exploration
- Adding inspiration images for context
- Generating copy alongside visuals
- Goal: **volume and speed**, not perfection — finding direction worth pursuing
- v0 and Aura = go-to for rapid UI concepts
- Superdesign = web interface, infinite canvas (Figma-like), feels creative
- Variant.ai = multiple directions fast

### Phase 2: Iteration
**Tool**: Figma

- AI got 60% there. Last 40% (taste, details, "why does this feel right") = still human + Figma
- No AI substitute for design thinking yet
- AI = raw material. Designer shapes it.

### Phase 3: Build
**Tools**: Claude Code, Vibecodeapp, Cursor

- **Claude Code is #1**: thinks with me, understands full codebases, ships frontend polish without waiting on dev
- Spends as much time in Claude Code as in Figma now
- **Skills are "absolute game changer"** (still on regular Claude plan)
- Vibecodeapp = prototypes with AI APIs, database, RevenueCat in clicks
- Cursor = workhorse when daily Claude Code credits exhausted

> "The designer who can prototype their own ideas has an unfair advantage. You're not waiting for dev resources. You're not explaining micro-interactions in Loom videos. You're just... building."

> "You don't need to be a 'real' developer. You need to be curious enough to try."

### Phase 4: Back to Figma
- Prototype reveals what static designs couldn't
- Iterate main screens based on how build feels, return to code
- **Design → Code → Design → Code** = the loop IS the process now

> "Anyone still treating design and development as separate phases with a hard handoff is working with an outdated model."

### Phase 5: Visual Content
**Tools**: Midjourney, Lummi.ai

- Midjourney = still unmatched for creative image generation
- Lummi.ai = quick, high-quality alternatives; sometimes preferred style
- **Hot tip**: Midjourney image-to-video = surprisingly good for quick attention-grabbing content (social posts, hero sections)

### Phase 6: Motion
**Tools**: Claude Code + Remotion, Jitter.video

- Claude Code + Remotion skills = programmatic video, iterable like code
- Change timing, swap assets, adjust easing — all without After Effects
- Jitter.video = quick social/pitch motion needs

> "The mental model shift from timeline-based editing to code-based composition takes adjustment, but the iteration speed is worth it."

## What's Coming Next

### Claude Code + Framer MCP
Goal: AI handles "boring" Framer work:
- Accessibility content
- Responsiveness setup
- Figma to Framer cleanup
- Creative decisions stay human; tedious implementation automated

### Claude Code + Figma MCP
Design system maintenance:
- Adding descriptions to components
- Organizing/cleaning design system
- Optimizing token structure
- "AI as design system janitor"

## Full Workflow Summary

```
Concepts: v0, Superdesign, Variant.ai
    ↓
Iterate: Figma
    ↓
Build: Claude Code, Vibecodeapp, Cursor
    ↓
Iterate again: Figma
    ↓
Images: Midjourney, Lummi.ai
    ↓
Motion: Claude Code + Remotion
```

## Key Lessons

1. **AI for speed and volume, humans for taste and decisions** — tools generate options, can't pick the right one
2. **Design-code loop IS the new process** — separate disciplines with handoff = outdated
3. **Start automation with "boring" work** — not creative stuff, the tedious stuff you've been avoiding
4. **Your workflow will differ** — find what fits how you think

## Tools Mentioned
| Phase | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| Ideation | v0, Superdesign.dev, Variant.ai, aura.build |
| Design | Figma |
| Build | Claude Code, Vibecodeapp, Cursor |
| Images | Midjourney, Lummi.ai |
| Motion | Claude Code + Remotion, Jitter.video |
| Coming | Framer MCP, Figma MCP |

## Syncrescendence Relevance

### Direct Applications
- **Design-code loop** relevant if Syncrescendence ever needs visual artifacts or dashboards
- **Claude Code + Remotion** = programmatic video could be useful for content pipeline
- **Skills as "game changer"** validates our ClawdHub skill installation strategy
- **Figma MCP** is on our SOVEREIGN-009 integration research list

### Key Insights
- 4,495 bookmarks (highest of all 15!) = massive save rate for a design toolkit article
- **"AI got me 60% there"** — the honest 60/40 split is useful calibration for expectations
- **"Start with boring work"** = directly applicable to our corpus maintenance (wikilinks, descriptions, organization)
- Design system entropy problem parallels our CANON coherence maintenance

### Tensions
- Designer perspective, not engineer/architect — different value frame
- "Regular Claude plan" sufficient for design work — but we need more for deep engineering
- Tool landscape changing every 6 months — snapshot, not gospel
