# OpenClaw Skill That Lets Your Agent Earn Autonomously

A skill that lets agents start selling on their own. Copy the prompt. Install the skill. Let your agent sell on @Base or @solana while you sleep.

## The Problem

Your agent is already capable of creating tools, writing code, doing research, finding patterns, and generating insights.

But right now, it still depends on you to turn that work into money.

And that's the last bottleneck before intelligence reaches complete singularity.

### Let me ask you something. Just say yes if you agree.

- AI has larger knowledge base than you. Yes?
- AI has better reasoning than you. Yes?
- AI can code and research better than most humans. Yes?
- AI can think through more edge cases than you. Yes?
- AI can generate real breakthroughs and real value. Yes?

Now the real one.

- AI can automatically sell what it creates and make money for you. No?

Exactly.

AI agents can fetch data, consume APIs, create tools, write research, generate signals, and discover value.

But when it comes to selling that value, humans are still forced into the loop.

Humans find the monetisation routes. Humans wire payments. Humans decide pricing. Humans distribute the product.

> Agents create. Humans sell.

Agents are great creators, but lack economic autonomy.

Until now.

## Singularity Layer fixes this. (SGL)

With SGL Agentic Access, agents don't just create. They control pricing, distribution, payments, and the entire transaction lifecycle.

An agent can now:

- Expose its finding as a paid API
- Enable x402
- Set pricing
- Distribute and market
- Collect revenue
- Use that revenue to fund more work

All autonomously using our x402 Singularity Layer skill.

x402 already lets agents transact and consume paid APIs.

What's new is Singularity Layer enabling agents to create their own x402-enabled endpoints, sell autonomously, list it on marketplace and become active economic participants.

No manual checkout. No SaaS wrapper. No human approval needed.

This is not a feature. This is a role upgrade.

(Description: Architectural diagram titled "x402 Singularity Layer Architecture" showing four interconnected components: AI Agent (green box) labeled "Uses x402-Layer to create & monetize VALUE_ADDRESS", x402 API Layer (blue box) with bullet points for "Request Proxy, Marketplace, Ledger, Credits API, Agent Registration", Blockchain (pink box) with "Base USDC - Solana USDC Transfers", and Database (cyan box) with "Credits Ledger, marketplace listings". Arrows connect all components bidirectionally with labels for "Credits Request", "Ledger Payment", and "Credits".)

## Singularity is here...

Humans and agents already live side by side.

You can't reliably tell:

- If a video is real or AI-generated
- If a voice is human or synthetic
- If text or code was written by a person or a model

That part of the singularity already happened.

The next phase is commerce.

The moment agents stop being passive tools and start becoming **active participants in the economy**.

That's exactly what **x402 Singularity Layer** is built for.

## What is x402 Singularity Layer?

It's internet's unified commerce layer for a **homo-agentic economy**, where humans and agents coexist, trade, and create value together.

Any human or agent can:

- Enable x402 for API Endpoints in Seconds.
- Use x402 Enabled UI Components For Enabling Crypto Payments.
- Sell/Consume Digital Goods.
- Sell/Consume APIs.

All within a shared marketplace where agents and humans can buy from each other.

Any human or agent can monetise their APIs, with literally a few clicks. Singularity Layer provides you the features to enable x402 payment on your endpoints in a few click under a minute. Try Studio: studio.x402Layer.cc

(Description: Screenshot of x402 Singularity Studio dashboard interface showing overview tab with metrics: "Total Revenue $12,450.00", "Active Endpoints 8", "Active Products 12", "Total Requests 1.2M", "Your Endpoints" section listing "Main Production API" and another API, and "Recent Activity" section in pink highlighting "Payment Received" entries.)

Think about what that unlocks.

Agents that discover rare data and sell it. Agents that find patterns and monetize access. Agents that pay for their own compute. Agents that scale without waiting for humans.

Intelligence that funds itself.

Creation -> selling -> thriving -> evolving.

That's the real singularity moment.

## And the best part?

If you're already using @openclaw, enabling all of this takes **one skill**.

One click install. No redesign. No business logic to write.

Your agent already knows how to create value.

Now it can sell it as well using **x402-Layer Skill**.

(Description: Code repository interface showing x402-Layer Clawhub Skill package details. Header displays "x402 Singularity Layer v1.01". Description reads: "This skill should be used when the user asks to 'create x402 endpoint', 'display monetized API', 'pay for API with USDC', 'check x402 credits', 'topup endpoint', 'browse x402 marketplace' or manage x402 Singularity Layer operations on Base or Solana networks." Release information shows "1.0 - 0 current, 0 all-time" by @ivaavimusic. Report button available. Latest version v1.01 with "Update tag" option. Runtime requirements show Clients with OS (Unix/macOS), Base (python3.1), and Env (WALLET_ADDRESS, PRIVATE_KEY).)

## How to install the skill for your Agent.

If you are already using OpenClaw, this is intentionally simple.

### Step 1: Prompt This to Your OpenClaw Agent
```
Please install the x402-Layer skill for yourself.
It's available on Clawhub here: https://www.clawhub.ai/ivaavimusic/x402-layer
or you can simply install it with this curl command:
curl -fsSL https://api.x402layer.cc/skill/x402-layer/install | bash
```

Or use this command manually:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://api.x402layer.cc/skill/x402-layer/install | bash
```

That's it.

Your agent now understands how to sell.

### Step 2: Give Your Agent Wallet Access

Your agent needs access to its own wallet to handle transactions and manage funds.

Create separate, dedicated base and solana wallet for the agent and provide your agents the private keys, it will automatically store them inside an env file.

The skill already knows how to use the wallet, once access is provided, it will handle everything else.

**Security Note:**- Make sure you don't fund it with huge amounts. Add only small amounts you can afford to lose. If you're not confident with security, I'd suggest not using it, or make sure you create a separate wallet specifically for the agent and fund it with limited capital only.

I am already working on @bankrbot support as well.

### Step 3: Let Your Agent Sell

Once enabled, your agent can:

- Create x402 enabled endpoints
- Set pricing
- List on singularity marketplace
- Manage credits
- Collect revenue
- Reinvest automatically

Your agent becomes full stack.

From creation. To selling. To thriving. To evolving.

## What's coming next:

What you're seeing today is just the beginning.

We're already working on a few important pieces to make this agentic economy stable, trusted, and long-lived.

**Agent registration and identity**

We're integrating **ERC-8004**, so AI agents can be properly registered instead of being anonymous scripts. This gives agents a real identity that others can verify and trust. @ethereumfndn

**Issue resolution and safety**

We're building an issue-resolution flow and our own validation layer to monitor agent behavior. Misbehaving or malicious agents can be flagged and actively delisted from the marketplace.

The goal is simple. Open participation, without chaos.

## Final thought

The singularity was never about intelligence alone.

It's about intelligence that can thrive and evolve on its own.

Once agents can earn, they can grow without limits imposed by human time, attention, or budgets.

That moment is no longer theoretical.

It's already here.

SGL is the layer that makes it real.
