# SkillBoss: Claude's Major Upgrade

@claudeai just got a massive upgrade today and I am proud to be part of it. From today on, Claude can generate videos, podcasts or host apps just like Lovable and Replit.

We just launched SkillBoss a skill plugin for Claude that enables Claude to:

✅ Generate videos, images, audio, postcast
✅ Build apps with logins, DBs, & payments built-in
✅ Send bulk marketing campaigns
✅ Host custom domains

SkillBoss credit will cover all of the above with access to VEO, ElevenLabs, Sora API and 50 more.

All you need is to go to [skillboss.co](http://skillboss.co), download [skillboss.zip](http://skillboss.zip) and drag to Claude. Then ask Claude to "make a cat video" or "build an app that charges $5"!

SkillBoss also works with Codex, Codex, OpenCode and even OpenClaw(yeah I know!)

To celebrate the launch, if you comment "skillboss", you will get 15 credit for free.
