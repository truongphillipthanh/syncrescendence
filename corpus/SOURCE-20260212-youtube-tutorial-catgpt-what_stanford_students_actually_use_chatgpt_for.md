## Description (no transcript available)

Students are using AI to get unstuck on assignments, to map their careers, to think through their lives, and —in some cases— to think for them.

I wanted to hear how students themselves are thinking about this.

So I went back to my alma mater, Stanford University, and asked 50 students how AI is changing the way they learn, think, and imagine their futures.

This video was created in partnership with OpenAI and Cat Goetze, AKA "CatGPT", in support of the 100 Chats Project.

*About 100 Chats*

The 100 Chats Project is a collaborative initiative where college students submitted their most useful, creative, and transformative real conversations with ChatGPT. Those conversations were tested, refined, and collectively ranked to produce a curated list of the 100 most powerful ChatGPT prompts for students.

The result is a snapshot of how the next generation is using AI as a thinking partner, not just a shortcut. You can explore the project and see the chats here:
