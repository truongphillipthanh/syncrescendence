# OpenAI and Anthropic Engineers Leaked Prompt Techniques

OpenAI and Anthropic engineers leaked the prompt techniques that actually work in 2026. I've been using insider knowledge for 6 months. The difference is insane.

Here are 6 prompts they don't want you to know (but I'm sharing anyway):

---

## 1. Deep Researcher Prompt

**Prompt:**

"I'm researching [topic]. First, break down this topic into 5 key questions that experts would ask. Then for each question: 1) Provide the mainstream view with specific examples, 2) Identify 2-3 contrarian perspectives that challenge this view, 3) Explain what data or evidence would prove each side right. Finally, synthesize this into a framework I can use to evaluate new information on this topic."

**Why it works:**

Researchers waste weeks reading scattered sources. This structures your entire research process upfront. I used this to write a market analysis that landed a $50K client.

## 2. The Content Mutation Engine

**Prompt:**

"Here's my core idea: [paste idea]. Transform this into 10 different formats: 1) A contrarian Twitter thread that challenges conventional wisdom, 2) A case study showing how someone failed by ignoring this, 3) A data-driven LinkedIn post"

**Why it works:**

Shows more content, but only if you structure it correctly with the right "mutations" at scale. Most creators don't understand this part - the AI's only constraint is putting fresh ideas into their work. This leads to content that actually resonates.

## 3. The Founder's Reality Check

**Prompt:**

"I'm building [product/service] for [target market]. Act as three different advisors who each interview me separately:

1) A skeptical investor who thinks this will fail - ask me the hardest questions about market size, competition, and"

**Why it works:**

This gives you a different perspective from actual founder interviews. I've found this catches problems before you hit them in the real world. Founders benefit from real feedback instead of cheerleading.

## 4. Reverse Engineering Virality

**Prompt:**

"Analyze this piece of content: [paste text/transcript]. First, identify the hidden narrative structure - what story is this actually telling? Then map out:

1) The emotional journey it creates,
2) The specific phrases that trigger"

**Why it works:**

Most people try to create viral content without understanding why content goes viral. This breaks down the actual mechanisms.

## 5. The Strategic Scenario Planner

**Prompt:**

"I'm making a decision about [specific decision]. Create 4 detailed future scenarios: 1) Best case - everything goes right, describe what happened and why, 2) Worst case - this fails catastrophically, walk me through how it unraveled,"

**Why it works:**

Most decisions are made with tunnel vision. This framework forces you to see multiple possible futures and plan accordingly.

## 6. The Weakness-to-Strength Transformer

**Prompt:**

"Here's my work: [paste draft/pitch/idea]. Your job is to be brutally honest. First, list everything wrong with this - weak arguments, logical gaps, confusing parts, places where I'm clearly bullshitting. Be harsh. Then, for each"

**Why it works:**

Self-editing is hard. This forces the AI to be a real critic and then shows you how to fix each problem systematically.

**Key Takeaway:** The difference between average and elite prompt users is structural thinking. These prompts work because they force you to think in frameworks, not just ask questions.
