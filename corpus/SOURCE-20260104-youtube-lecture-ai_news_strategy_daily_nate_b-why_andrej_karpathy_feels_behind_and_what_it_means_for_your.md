What's really happening with technical skills in the age of AI? The common story is that engineers need to code faster — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on the new technical skill tree that applies to everyone:
- Why Andre Karpathy feels behind and what that means for leaders
- How leverage shifted from writing code to orchestrating probabilistic systems
- What the four-level skill tree looks like from conditioning to compounding
- Where authority comes from when you delegate generation to LLMs

Chapters:
0:00 Introduction: Andre Karpathy Feels Behind 
01:15 What Changed: The Phase Transition in Technical Leverage 
02:24 The Old World: Authorship Equals Authority 
04:39 What Broke: Control Is No Longer the Default 
06:56 What Broke: Effort No Longer Maps to Output 
07:50 What Broke: The Abstraction Stack Got Inverted 
09:23 What Broke: The Old Boundaries Don't Make Sense 
11:00 The Root Node: Separate Generation from Decisioning 
13:00 Level 1: Conditioning (Intent, Context, Constraints) 
15:30 Level 2: Authority (Verification, Provenance, Permissions) 
18:00 Level 3: Workflows (Pipelines, Failure Modes, Observability) 
20:38 Level 4: Compounding (Evals, Feedback Loops, Governance) 
22:53 The Factorio Analogy: Building Automated Factories 
25:00 Closing: Orchestrating Uncertainty Without Losing Authority

Organizations that recognize this as a workforce-wide challenge and build deliberate skill trees around separating generation from decisioning will realize 10X speedups, while those clinging to technical versus non-technical hierarchies will fall behind in 2026.
