# OpenClaw For Business Setup (That Scales Revenue)

(Description: Illustration showing the evolution from primitive ape to human businessman sitting at a desk, with the final figure holding a large red lobster/claw, representing OpenClaw's progression into business use.)

Ordering food with your OpenClaw is cute, but making money with it is better.

In this post, I'm going to talk about how my system works under the hood.

If you want some OpenClaw business use case examples, the original post is [here](https://x.com/ericosiu/status/2019104901905912155).

## 1. Verify + Learn Loops

Agents can't mark something "done" until they verify it actually happened. After each task, they extract lessons and write them down so the same mistake never happens twice.
```
ANALYZE → RECOMMEND → [APPROVE] → EXECUTE → VERIFY → LEARN

↓ Is it actually done? (retry if not)
↓ Extract lesson for next time
```

**Why it matters:** Agents don't move on until work is verified complete. Every run makes the next run smarter.

## 2. Decision Interface Pattern

Agents don't send me reports that dead-end. Every output ends with "Approve X or Reject X", forcing a decision and capturing my feedback to improve next time.

Every agent output ends with:
```
🎯 ACTION [#]: [Specific title]
📊 Data: [Numbers driving this]
⚡️ Impact: [Expected outcome]
💪 Effort: [Low/Med/High]
Reply: "Approve 1" or "Reject 1 - [reason]"
```

**Why it matters:** You ultimately want your agents to propose and ultimately take action. Rejection reasons get logged and learned from.

## 3. Autonomy Levels (Codified)

New agents start restricted - insights only, no execution. As they prove reliable, I unlock more permissions. Level 1 is "report to me." Level 4 is "handle it and give me a weekly summary."

| Level | Description |
| ----- | --------------------------------- |
| 1 | Report only (insights, no action) |
| 2 | Recommend + execute on approval |
| 3 | Execute low-risk, report after |
| 4 | Full autonomy with weekly summary |

New agents start at Level 1. Trust is earned, not given.

## 4. The Workspace Architecture

Every agent lives in a folder with simple text files - identity, memory, learnings. No database, no complex infrastructure. If something breaks, I open a file and read it like a document.
```
~/.openclaw/workspace/
├── SOUL.md                  # Agent identity + personality
├── AGENTS.md                # Operating manual
├── MEMORY.md                # Long-term learnings
├── shared-learnings/        # Cross-agent knowledge
│   ├── oracle/              # SEO patterns
│   ├── flash/               # Content patterns
│   └── arrow/               # Sales patterns
├── feedback/                # Decision logs (approve/reject)
└── docs/                    # Playbooks, specs
```

**Why it matters:** No database = easy debugging. git blame shows exactly what changed. Human-readable files mean you can audit anything in 30 seconds.

## 5. Cron Scheduling (The Proactive Brain)

I don't ask my agents for updates — they push to me on a schedule. SEO digest at 7am, deal recommendations at 8am. Problems surface before I even think to check.

| Time | Job |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| 7:00am | Oracle SEO Digest |
| 7:30am | Strategic Digest |
| 8:00am | Deal of the Day |
| Weekly | Feedback summary + learnings |

**Why it matters:** Agents don't wait for you. They surface problems before you ask.

## 6. Security Model

Credentials live in 1Password, not in code. Telegram bots only respond to me (allowlisted). Every decision gets logged. The Mac Mini runs locally - my data never touches a random cloud.

I create a brand new vault and share it with this agent. I also make sure that I make a new Gmail and Apple ID account.

| Layer | Implementation |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Credentials | 1Password vault (agents pull via CLI) |
| Access | Telegram allowlists (bots only talk to approved users) |
| Audit | Every decision logged to feedback JSONs |
| Isolation | Mac Mini runs locally, not cloud |
| Execution | High-stakes = human approval required |

## 7. Multi-Agent Coordination

Alfred is my chief of staff who delegates to specialists (Oracle for SEO, Flash for content, Arrow for sales). They share a "learnings" folder - when one agent figures something out, the others benefit.
```
Alfred (Orchestrator)
│
├── Oracle (SEO) ──┐
├── Flash (Content)├── shared-learnings/
└── Arrow (Sales) ─┘
```

# Token savings and other random tips

## 1. Sonnet for daily, Opus for strategic

Routine crons (SEO digest, deal finder) run on Sonnet (~$0.15/run). Opus only fires for high-stakes decisions. 10x cost difference, same outcome for 80% of tasks.

## 2. Isolated sessions per cron

Each scheduled job runs in its own session - no context bleed. My 7am SEO digest doesn't carry the 8am deal finder's history. Clean slate = smaller context = faster + cheaper.

## 3. Compact and use subagents often

Less of a problem with Opus 4.6 and future models, but I still /compact frequently because it's a pain in the butt to have context overload. My setup actually broke when it overloaded so yeah, compact often. When it's a complex task, I'll ask it to spawn subagents to work on things in parallel.

## 4. I plan and test with Claude Code, then I move things over to OpenClaw

I just started doing this recently because with Claude Code, I'm going to be able to spend more time planning deeply and thoughtfully vs just dictating a thought and letting OpenClaw yolo from my Telegram.

## 5. Speaking of dictating... WisprFlow on the phone ftw

Using WisprFlow on mobile has been incredible for dictation. Can't live without it. I previously didn't use any dictation at all but to be more precise with my words, this is the way to go.

## 6. Learnings live in files, not prompts

Instead of "remember Eric prefers X" in every prompt, agents read shared-learnings/oracle/preferences.md on demand. Knowledge scales without prompt bloat.

## 7. The physical part

After I set up my Mac Mini, I plug in an HDMI Dummy Plug to 'trick' it into thinking it has a monitor. If I need to get in later, I just VNC my way in or remote screenshare via Google Remote Desktop.

(Description: Photograph of a white Mac Mini against a dark wooden desk surface. A black HDMI cable is plugged into the top of the device. The Mac Mini has the distinctive Apple logo on its front face. The setup sits on a wooden surface with a blurred wooden background.)

# Conclusion

Obviously, your mileage may vary based on your needs and by no means am I saying I have the perfect setup. But as a non-technical founder, this is what's working for me so far. I'm sure I'll change my mind a lot in the coming months.
