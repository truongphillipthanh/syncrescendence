## Description (no transcript available)

Elon Musk's merger of XAI and SpaceX fuses AI model development with rocket and satellite infrastructure, reshaping competition and IPO math.

Public reaction splits between techno-optimism about space-scale AI and sharp skepticism over financial motives, investor dilution, and the spectacle around Grok.
