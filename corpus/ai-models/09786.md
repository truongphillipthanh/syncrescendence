What's really happening with LLM-induced psychosis in leadership? The common story is that AI just makes us smarter — but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on a psychiatric risk emerging in 2026 workplaces:
- Why David Budden's Navier-Stokes claim reveals LLM psychosis symptoms
- How leaders fall victim to confirmation bias with ChatGPT
- What happens when domain expertise gets replaced by AI confidence
- Where businesses will start testing executives for undue AI influence

The gap between using AI as a tool and letting it hijack your judgment will define stable leadership in 2026, and executives who can't distinguish their expertise from the LLM's will become liabilities to their organizations.
