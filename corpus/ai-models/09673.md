The world of AI is trying to slow down for the holidays, but the announcements are still coming in HOT! 

This week, we're diving deep into the massive waves coming from OpenAI, including the highly anticipated GPT-5.2 release (which we'll pick up right from the Rivian event!), and the huge leak of their new image model.

Plus, we'll check out the video generation world with a hands-on look at Runway's Gen-4.5 (it's actually demo-able now!), and all the major model updates from the open-source side, including Mistral’s Devstral 2 for coding and the new vision-language model from Zhipu AI.

Finally, we hit the rapid-fire headlines: Meta’s latest acquisition, why an AI Christmas ad failed, and what's next for AI agents thanks to the new Agentic AI Foundation.
