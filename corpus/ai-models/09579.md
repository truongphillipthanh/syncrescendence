OpenAI just declared a full Code Red, and it’s way bigger than the headlines make it sound. In this video, I break down what the internal memo really says, why OpenAI suddenly went into panic mode, and how competitors like Google’s Gemini and Anthropic pushed them here.

Was this memo meant to leak? Is a new model dropping next week? And what does this mean for ChatGPT, dev tools, and the entire AI race?
