## Description (no transcript available)

Gemini 3 and its new Personal Intelligence engine have finally arrived, bringing a level of customization that feels like a massive leap for the platform. I was granted early access to the feature, and in this video, I dive into how Gemini now connects the dots across your entire Google ecosystem to provide help that is actually tailored to your world.

I'll show you how to unlock and master these new capabilities, including:
- A hands-on test using Gemini to retrieve specific travel details and media history from months ago
- The new For You chip on the homescreen that suggests custom queries based on your recent activity
- How I use Personal Intelligence to bridge the gap between my past travels in Italy and my professional gear planning for upcoming shoots
- My top tips for managing your privacy and controlling which apps, like Gmail or Photos, are connected
