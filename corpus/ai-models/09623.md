## Description (no transcript available)

Big AI news today! We dive into the upcoming release of Grok 4.20, which is dominating the profit-based Alpha Arena and is expected to launch before the end of the year. Meanwhile, the battle for the top spot on the LM Arena heats up as Google’s Gemini 3.0 Pro holds the lead, forcing OpenAI into "Code Red" with mysterious new test models like Emperor and Rockhopper appearing in the wild.

We also break down a massive shift in hardware strategy: reports suggest Google is now selling TPUs directly to companies like Anthropic, challenging Nvidia's dominance. Plus, we explore Google’s new "Titans" and "Mira" papers on long-term memory and "surprise" metrics in AI, and discuss Elon Musk’s plan to launch solar-powered AI data centers into space via SpaceX.
