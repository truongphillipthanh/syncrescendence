In this episode, we put the latest AI video models through real creator workflows to see which ones are hype and which ones are actually usable today. From Kling’s new models and Runway Gen‑4.5 to Apple’s STARFlow‑V and more, this video is all about testing what’s possible with AI‑generated video right now in a week where the “news” was quiet but the models went wild.​

We also touch on OpenAI’s “code red”, Google’s Gemini updates, Amazon’s enterprise AI moves, DeepSeek, Mistral, KREA’s Node App Builder, and the Nano Banana meme that’s trying to redefine how we think about foundation models for video. Strap in for a chaotic, experimental tour of the tools that might be powering your next YouTube video, short film, or ad.​
