Nightshift is a dopamine hidden gem for agentic junkies. You go to sleep, agents wake up and fix your codebase, you wake up to a bunch of PRs with clean-ups and refactors ready to review. It's optimized for leftover tokens [github.com/marcus/nightsh...](https://github.com/marcus/nightshift) by @zzzmarcus

"worst case you close the PR", it's like a surprise from leftover tokens 😁 which you can schedule once a week or so

Hehe, more likely LPU usage (like Groq or Cerebras) which will be dominant for inference.. GPUs with HBMs will train models based on yesterday's night PRs :P
