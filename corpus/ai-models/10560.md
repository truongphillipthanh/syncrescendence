## Description (no transcript available)

In this Lightning pod, swyx hosts Jaya Gupta and Ashu Garg from Foundation Capital to discuss the emergence of context graphs. They define this new framework as the institutional memory of "the why" behind business decisions, captured through decision traces—the sequence of steps and human reasoning that models often miss. The conversation explores how these graphs will become the defensible moat for the next generation of applied AI companies and systems of agents.
