# Opus 4.6 Creative Writing Test

(Description: A dimly lit space station interior with industrial paneling, flickering ceiling panels, control systems, and a large observation window framing Earth below in white and blue. Text overlay reads "INVENTORY: The Final Hours on Station")

## Prompt

Write a 500-word flash fiction piece in second person about the last day of a space station's life. End on an ambiguous note.

### Formatting Rule

Do not use em dashes anywhere in the piece. Not once. Use periods, commas, colons, semicolons, or line breaks instead. Em dashes are an AI writing crutch. Kill them.

### Voice & Style

Write like a human with a specific, lived-in voice. Not a narrator performing "good writing." Think of the prose style of Ray Bradbury's lyricism crossed with Denis Johnson's rawness. Sentences should vary wildly in length. Some fragments. Some that unspool. Let rhythm do emotional work.

### Hard Rules. Avoid These Like Plague

- No "echoed through," "hung heavy," "a testament to," "the silence was deafening," "sent a shiver down," "danced across," "bathed in light," "ethereal glow," "a tapestry of," "whispered promises," or any phrase that sounds like it was stitched together from a thousand internet stories.
- No "profound realizations." No characters marveling at the beauty of the universe in generic ways.
- Do not end with a poetic one-liner that tries to sound deep. Earn the ambiguity through situation, not through a clever closing sentence.
- Never use the word "delicate," "gossamer," "luminous," "void," or "vestiges."

### What I Want Instead

- Concrete, ugly, specific sensory details. What does the station smell like on its last day? What's the texture of a railing someone has gripped ten thousand times? Give me the hangnail, the coffee ring, the frayed velcro.
- At least one moment that's mundane and absurd. Because real endings aren't cinematic. Someone is probably annoyed about something petty even as everything falls apart.
- The emotional weight should come from what's unsaid. Let subtext do the heavy lifting. If a character feels grief, show me what they do with their hands. Don't tell me they feel grief.
- Surprise me structurally. Maybe a list intrudes. Maybe a paragraph is just one word. Maybe time skips without warning. Do something I wouldn't expect.

### Character

The "you" in the second person should feel like a specific person with a history on this station. Not an everyman. Give them one odd, particular habit or memory that makes them irreplaceable as a character. Don't explain the habit. Just show it.

### The Ending

The ambiguity should be genuine. Not "did they survive or didn't they?" but something stranger. A detail that reframes everything. A question the reader can't stop turning over. The kind of ending that gets better the more you think about it.

Before you write, take a breath. Forget what flash fiction "usually" sounds like. Write something that could only exist once.

## Response: Inventory

You count the ceiling tiles again. Forty-seven. There have always been forty-seven, but you count them every morning because one time, in year two, there were forty-eight, and nobody believed you, and you never found the extra one, and you have not stopped looking.

Forty-seven today. Last day. Forty-seven.

The coffee dispenser gives you the same burnt-plastic-tasting half cup it's given you for six years. You drink it standing up because chair four, your chair, has a crack in the left armrest that pinches the skin of your elbow if you lean wrong, and today you don't want one more small pain. The station smells like it always smells: recycled air with an undertone of copper and someone's old socks and the faint, persistent sweetness of the sealant they used on Module C after the micrometeorite hit in 2031. You have never been able to describe that sweetness to anyone back home. Caramel, but wrong. Like caramel that's sorry about something.

Kowalski is upset about the garlic press.

"It's station property," she says, holding it up, and you watch her fingers. They're shaking. Not about the garlic press.

"Take it," you say.

"It's inventoried."

"So un-inventory it."

She puts it back in the drawer. Closes the drawer. Opens the drawer. Takes it out again. You turn away to give her something, though you're not sure what. Privacy, maybe. Or plausible deniability.

Here is what you will not take with you:

The scuff mark by the portside hatch where you kicked the wall after the transmission from David. The pencil wedged behind the water recycler that you dropped in year one and could never reach. Forty-seven ceiling tiles. The way Earth looks at 0300 when the solar panels shift and for nine seconds the observation window is unobstructed and the planet is just, there, enormous and blue-white and stupid with beauty, and you always wanted to feel something huge in those nine seconds but mostly you thought about your dry skin or your schedule or the fact that you could hear the station's skeleton ticking and groaning around you like a body digesting.

The deorbit burn is scheduled for 1400. They'll fire the thrusters. The station will drop, and drag will do the rest. Most of it will burn up over the South Pacific. Some of it won't.

You run your thumb along the railing outside the lab. The metal is smooth in the middle where six crews' worth of hands have worn it down, rough at the edges where nobody grips. You know this railing the way you know your own teeth. Tongue-knowledge. Automatic.

At 1142, you float through Module B and notice the light in the ceiling is flickering again. The one Prasad fixed eight times. You stop. You could report it. You could fix it yourself; you know how, you've watched Prasad do it, the trick with the housing clip. You could let it flicker for the last three hours of this place's life and it wouldn't matter at all.

You open the panel. You fix the light.

You close the panel.

At 1307, everyone is on the evacuation shuttle. You do a final walkthrough because that's protocol, but also because you asked to, and they let you, and you are not thinking about why you asked. The station is quiet in a way it has never been. You can hear the cooling system. You can hear your own blood.

In the lab, on the counter, there's a coffee ring you left this morning. You look at it for a long time.

You walk back toward the shuttle hatch. You stop at the portside junction where the corridor splits. Left goes to the shuttle. Right goes deeper into the station. Toward Module C, where the sealant smells like sorry caramel, where the extra ceiling tile might still be hiding.

You're standing there when Kowalski radios. "You coming?"

You count to four before you answer. You're not sure why four. You're not sure what you do during those four seconds. When you try to remember later, and you will try, often, there's just a gap. A white space where a decision was or wasn't.

"Yeah," you say. "Coming."

The hatch is twenty steps to the left. You know this. You counted once, in year one. Twenty steps.

You start walking.
