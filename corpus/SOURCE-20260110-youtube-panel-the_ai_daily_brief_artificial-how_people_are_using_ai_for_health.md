OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health as a dedicated encrypted workspace connecting medical records and wellness apps with isolated health memory. Company data shows over 40 million weekly users ask about symptoms, test results, treatments, insurance navigation, and after-hours care, especially in rural and underserved areas. Discussions focus on clinical adoption, potential to streamline care and build a health-data moat, and worries about privacy, regulation, and startup disruption.
