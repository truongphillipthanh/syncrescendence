Intel is now in high-volume production of its latest chip node, 18A, at a new fab in Arizona, where it hopes to compete with TSMC and bring advanced chip manufacturing back to U.S. soil. But so far, no major external customers are making on 18A. Following years of missteps and delays, Intel faces an uphill battle to regain foundry customer trust. In the meantime, its received billions from Nvidia, SoftBank and the U.S. government - which took a 10% stake in the struggling company. CNBC got the first ever on-camera tour inside Fab52 and asked its foundry head about why this time, it won’t fail.
