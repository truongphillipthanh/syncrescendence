# OpenAI Frontier Announcement Thread

## Post 1
Introducing OpenAI Frontier—a new platform that helps enterprises build, deploy, and manage AI coworkers that can do real work.

## Post 2
Frontier gives agents the same skills people need to succeed at work:

- Understand how work gets done
- Use a computer and tools
- Improve quality over time
- **Stay governed & observable**

(Description: A diagram titled "OpenAI Frontier" showing the system architecture with three main sections: Interfaces (ChatGPT Enterprise, OpenAI Atlas, Business Applications), Agents (Your Agents, OpenAI Agents, Third-Party Agents), and Core Components (Evaluation and Optimization with "Built-in evaluation and optimization loops to improve performance", Agent Execution with "Model intelligence and tools for agents to plan, act, and recover near-world tasks", and Business Context with "Shared business context across data, systems, and workflows"). Additional notation indicates "Enterprise security and governance designed for sensitive and regulated work" and "Your systems of record".)

## Post 3
We also pair OpenAI Forward Deployed Engineers with your team, working side by side to develop your best practices to build and run agents in production.

And there's a tight feedback loop to OpenAI Research: as you deploy agents, we learn what needs to improve around the model and how models should evolve to be more useful for your work.

## Post 4
Frontier is available today to a limited set of customers, with broader availability coming over the next few months.

@HP, @Intuit, @Oracle, @StateFarm, @thermofisher, and @Uber are among the first to adopt Frontier, and dozens of existing customers–including @BBVA, @Cisco, and @TMobile–have already piloted the approach.

## Post 5
We're also working with a small group of Frontier partners—@AbridgeHQ, @AmbienceAI, @clay, @DecagonAI, @harvey, and @SierraPlatform—to design solutions for enterprises and support deployment.

Over time, we'll expand the program and welcome more builders focused on enterprise AI.
