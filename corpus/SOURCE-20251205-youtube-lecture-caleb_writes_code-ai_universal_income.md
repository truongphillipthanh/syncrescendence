## Description (no transcript available)

AI is inching towards disrupting many industries and the public have yet to see any form of universal basic income, bur are faced with unemployment.
Does the deflationary nature of AI really work positively for humanity as AI takes roots in our society? And how will the excess profit and gains be distributed so that the wealth gap is improved rather than being the rich getting richer? What about maslow's hierarchy of needs and how AI will work its way up?
