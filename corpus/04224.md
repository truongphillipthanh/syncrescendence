## Analogy (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260217-010-0006
**Lines**: 38-40
**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.40

> The Eurorack synthesizer system, where synthesists discover novel patches unanticipated by manufacturers due to the safety of experimentation, serves as an analogy for knowledge systems. This suggests that a similar dynamic might allow for the discovery of new configurations within knowledge systems.

## Claim (4)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260217-010-0001
**Lines**: 6-8
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.80

> A long-standing 'war' in knowledge management communities, concerning different methodologies like Zettelkasten, PARA, and Cornell, is based on a false premise.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260217-010-0003
**Lines**: 16-20
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Different knowledge management methodologies (e.g., Zettelkasten, PARA, Cornell) represent trade-off choices, not quality rankings, in how they prioritize aspects like connection density, project organization, or structured processing.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260217-010-0005
**Lines**: 37-43
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Configuration dimensions in knowledge systems are not independent; choices in one dimension create pressure on others, leading to cascading effects (e.g., atomic granularity forces explicit linking, deep navigation, and heavy processing).

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260217-010-0007
**Lines**: 40-42
**Context**: hypothesis / limitation
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.30, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.30

> Unlike synthesizers with continuous voltage ranges, knowledge system dimensions might possess discrete coherence attractors that pull any novel configuration back toward an established tradition.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260217-010-0002
**Lines**: 13-16
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Knowledge management methodologies are not competing paradigms but named points within a shared configuration space, each representing different, internally consistent choices along underlying dimensions.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260217-010-0004
**Lines**: 23-34
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The space of possible knowledge systems can be parameterized by eight configuration dimensions: Note granularity, Organization, Linking philosophy, Processing intensity, Navigation depth, Maintenance cadence, Schema density, and Automation level.

## Prediction (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260217-010-0008
**Lines**: 43-44
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.90, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.20

> The next hundred derivations will test whether the space between known settings in knowledge systems holds anything genuinely new, despite the tendency for novel configurations to be pulled back to tradition.
