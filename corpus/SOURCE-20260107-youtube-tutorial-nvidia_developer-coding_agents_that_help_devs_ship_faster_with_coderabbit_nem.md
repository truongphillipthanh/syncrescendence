How do CodeRabbit and NVIDIA Nemotron work together to make developers’ lives easier and help teams ship faster? In this session, a founding engineer and the head of enterprise engineering at CodeRabbit will walk through a step‑by‑step workflow for building and operating Nemotron‑powered coding agents that automate common developer workflows in production.
​
In this live walkthrough, you’ll learn how to:
- Design multi‑model agents that pair efficient Nemotron models for high‑volume orchestration and context building with frontier models for state‑of‑the‑art reasoning.

- Orchestrate an end‑to‑end agent loop: pulling signals from code, knowledge bases, and project tools, using Nemotron to structure and summarize this context, and routing it into downstream tasks.

- Apply these patterns in your own stack to build domain‑specific agentic workflows that balance latency, cost, and reliability for everyday developer workflows.
​
Bring your questions on architecting and operating agentic workflows for modern software teams, we’ll address them live as we walk through the step‑by‑step flow, configuration, and code in real time.
