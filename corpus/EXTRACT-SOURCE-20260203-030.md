## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260203-030-0007
**Lines**: 43-43
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Dash incorporates a self-learning component that runs in parallel to the core agent loop.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260203-030-0006
**Lines**: 26-38
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Dash is a self-learning data agent that grounds its answers in 6 layers of context: Table Usage (schema, columns, relationships), Human Annotations (metrics, definitions, gotchas), Query Patterns (known working SQL), Institutional Knowledge (external docs, research), Memory (error patterns, discovered fixes), and Runtime Context (live schema changes).

## Praxis Hook (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260203-030-0003
**Lines**: 8-9
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Dash's architecture enables an agent to learn from mistakes, layer in context as needed, and improve with use.

**Lines**: 45-46
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.60

> When an agent makes a mistake, it should capture the fix and store it in a searchable learning store; when something works, it should identify the pattern and add it to its knowledge base.
