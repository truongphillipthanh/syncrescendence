In this video explore Free Energy Principle – a powerful framework in neuroscience, which aims to explain brain function as predicting sensory observations through building models of the world. We discuss generative and recognition models, the role of priors, variational inference, and how free energy principle explains some every day observations such as optical illusion. This is a high-level conceptual, rather than mathematical treatment.
