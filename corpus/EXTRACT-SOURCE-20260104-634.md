## Claim (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260104-634-0001
**Lines**: 12-13
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.70

> New AI research proves that 'Context Rot' destroys reasoning capabilities as inputs scale, despite promises of 'infinite' context windows.

> Recursive Language Models (RLMs) achieve a staggering leap in performance, with RLM(GPT-5) scoring 58% on quadratic complexity tasks where base GPT-5 scores below 0.1%.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260104-634-0002
**Lines**: 15-16
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Recursive Language Models (RLMs) are a radical solution introduced by MIT research that act as a Neurosymbolic Operating System.

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260104-634-0003
**Lines**: 16-18
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Recursive Language Models (RLMs) address 'Context Rot' by writing Python code to mechanically split massive datasets and recursively 'spawn' fresh model instances to process them, rather than force-feeding data into a single Transformer.

## Prediction (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260104-634-0005
**Lines**: 23-23
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.40

> The 'Inference-Time Scaling' mechanism of Recursive Language Models (RLMs) signals the end of static Large Language Models (LLMs) as we know them.
