## Concept (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251112-1153-0003
**Lines**: 20-20
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Frontier models are a category of LLMs that represent the cutting edge of AI capabilities, often characterized by their scale and advanced performance.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251112-1153-0004
**Lines**: 20-20
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Speciality models are LLMs designed or finetuned for specific tasks or domains, offering optimized performance for those particular applications.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251112-1153-0002
**Lines**: 20-20
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.30, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.80, epistemic_stability=0.70

> A decision matrix can be used to pick the appropriate LLM for a specific use case by evaluating models against criteria such as architecture, training data, finetuning/alignment, licensing, and whether they are frontier or speciality models.

## Praxis Hook (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20251112-1153-0001
**Lines**: 20-20
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.90, epistemic_stability=0.80

> When selecting a Large Language Model (LLM) for a project, key differentiating factors to consider include architecture, training data, finetuning and alignment, licensing, whether it's a frontier model, and if it's a speciality model.
