## Analogy (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-015-0003
**Lines**: 21-30
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.50

> AI capex is analogous to government fiscal stimulus in its underlying mechanics: both involve the private sector absorbing duration (via bonds/treasuries), the government/hyperscaler deploying cash, and this cash circulating through the real economy with a multiplier effect, positively impacting financial asset prices.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-015-0008
**Lines**: 51-55
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.60

> Money or liquidity is like water in a tub, where financial assets are floating rubber ducks; increasing the total volume of water (rate cuts/QE), unclogging pipes (plumbing actions like RMP), or decreasing drainage raises asset prices.

## Claim (7)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-015-0001
**Lines**: 8-10
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.60

> A market regime change is occurring due to a shortage of financial capital, driven by the AI capital expenditure (capex) cycle.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-015-0002
**Lines**: 11-13
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The web 2.0 and SaaS paradigms of the 2010s market boom were capital-light, leading to an overabundance of capital flowing into speculative assets.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-015-0004
**Lines**: 33-37
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.50

> When dry powder in the economy is exhausted, any dollar invested in AI capex must come from another source, leading to a scramble for capital and increased cost of capital (market-based interest rates).

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-015-0005
**Lines**: 40-43
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.60

> A shortage of money initiates a weeding-out process among assets, disproportionately harming speculative assets, similar to how they disproportionately benefit from capital abundance.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-015-0007
**Lines**: 46-47
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Fiscal stimulus rarely faces capital crowding out because the Federal Reserve often absorbs the duration.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-015-0009
**Lines**: 57-58
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.50, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The demand for money is as important as its supply, and current conditions indicate excessive demand, leading to a crowding-out effect.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-015-0010
**Lines**: 61-68
**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.30, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Major capital sources like the Saudis and Softbank are reportedly 'tapped out,' meaning they must sell existing assets to fund new commitments, potentially leading to a cascade of asset sales and falling prices.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260205-015-0006
**Lines**: 43-44
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.30, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.40

> AI capex can be viewed as a form of 'inverse Quantitative Easing (QE)' with negative portfolio balancing effects.
