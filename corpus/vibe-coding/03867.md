## Analogy (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260211-011-0006
**Lines**: 65-68
**Context**: anecdote / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> A woodworker spending six figures annually on exotic hardwoods without building anything is analogous to current AI spending; they are investing in scrap, where the wood exists for the tools to touch, and the shavings are the product.

## Claim (9)

> A Chiyozuru kanna, despite its high cost and meticulous setup, is economically worthless compared to a power planer that performs the same work in a fraction of the time.

> The "AI slop essay" titled "Something Big is Happening," generated by Matt Shumer, functioned as a tool-shaped object because its consumption and sharing were the product, not its output or content.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260211-011-0004
**Lines**: 53-56
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> The current AI boom is characterized by a dominant narrative focused on the rate of consumption (spending on GPU farms, expensing tools) rather than on what AI has actually built or produced.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260211-011-0005
**Lines**: 60-63
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.30, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.60

> We are spending unprecedented sums on AI systems, and the primary product of that spending is the experience of spending it, with AI being everywhere in consumption but almost nowhere in output.

**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.40, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The framing of "token budget" as a proxy for resources and work, implying a linear relationship between tokens consumed and output, is often inaccurate, as the relationship between tokens and value is typically a "cloud."

> The problem with tool-shaped objects arises when they are designed to hide the fact that the feeling of work, rather than actual work, becomes the product.

> FarmVille is a tool-shaped object where the entire product is the experience of numbers going up, catering to a market for feeling productive rather than being productive.

> Teams of smart engineers often build agent systems of breathtaking complexity whose primary output is the existence and operation of the system itself, generating logs, reports, and dashboards without necessarily producing external value.

**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.60

> A "tool-shaped object" is a category of object that feels like a tool, can be held and used, and produces the feeling of work (friction, labor, forward motion) but does not produce actual work. Its function is to feel like a tool.

**Lines**: 124-127
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.50

> The quality that makes LLMs effective as 'tool-shaped objects' is their verbal fluency, allowing them to produce the 'sensation of anything,' unlike prior tools constrained by their medium.

> An agent can be built to read email, summarize contents, draft responses, check responses against style guides, route responses through approval chains, log interactions, and report results to a dashboard.

## Prediction (1)
