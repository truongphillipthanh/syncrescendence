# Everyone Can Code Now. That's the Problem.

(Description: Dark navy background with abstract code visualization. Multiple horizontal lines of varying colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple) representing lines of code. Red X marks scattered throughout, yellow warning/alert triangles placed on several sections, and chaotic red squiggles suggesting broken or error-prone code patterns. The visualization metaphorically depicts buggy, problematic software development.)

## The Narrative of Software's Death

"Software is Dead" the new narrative I see everywhere. On my X feed, on Reddit, even in stock markets. Everyone is screaming that software is dead and that anyone can now build their own Facebook, Shopify, Figma, or TurboTax. Nobody needs software developers anymore because we can program in plain English. What can go wrong?

## The Dream Comes True

The dream came true for the "non-technical guys." They can finally pursue their vision of creating alternatives to Facebook, Salesforce, Google, Discord, and so on. The boom started. The new gold rush is in mobile apps, specifically the Apple ecosystem, for a few reasons: it's easy to enter. You just need an Apple Developer subscription at $99/year, a Claude or Codex subscription at $200/month, and maybe some design tools like Figma. That's it. You're a developer now.

I was hoping to see amazing new projects. Innovation. Because everyone can code in English now, right?

## The Reality

The reality tells us different.

We don't see innovative alternatives to Facebook, TikTok, or Duolingo. Instead we have 1 million Habit Tracker apps and their variations. 1 million Screen Time apps. 1 million broken fitness apps that count everything except the calories on your plate. And I'm not even talking about security negligence: leaked API keys, exposed credentials, the basics that get ignored.

### The New Creator Reality

The new reality is that everyone can be a creator now. That's a fact. But these new creators develop everything except useful software. They are the Temu of tech, low quality apps that maybe have a heartbeat because of TikTok views, but in a year will be dead. Because the same "non-technical guys" will develop 1 million more alternatives just like it.

### Why This Happens

Why does this happen? Because building complex projects requires a lot more than a Claude subscription and an AI-generated design. It requires more than English. It requires basic knowledge of cybersecurity, architecture, and how to make things work effectively at scale.

## The Coming Flood

The new reality of low quality software is here. Expect the number of these vibe-coded apps to double, maybe triple. Apple will have a problem with this as it's getting harder and harder to find a good app that actually does what it says.

## Predictions for the Future

We're living in a new era that can only be compared to the birth of the internet. It will be messy, scary, and chaotic. But history shows us it won't stay this way. It will pass. The ones who really built something amazing during this time will be used more and more for years to come. But 95% of everyone showcasing their MRR screenshots? They'll disappear.

### The Senior Developer Paradox

Senior developers aren't going anywhere, companies will always need them. What's changing is that a single senior dev with AI tools can now replace an entire small team. Great for profits. Terrible for everyone trying to become that senior dev.

But here's a catch I keep thinking about: companies aren't hiring juniors anymore because AI can do their job. All the work gets handled by senior staff. Great. But what happens when that senior decides to leave? Who replaces them? The juniors who needed to evolve into seniors can't find a place to learn and grow.

## Conclusion

Hard to tell what happens next. I live in the same reality as everyone else and I'm also trying to adapt. But one thing is guaranteed, happiness and tears are both coming.
