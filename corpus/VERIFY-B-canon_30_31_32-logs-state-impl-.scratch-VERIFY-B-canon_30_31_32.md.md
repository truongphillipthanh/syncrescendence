## PARTIAL (mentioned but underrepresented in v2)

- **ASA Model** → v2 §2.2 Cluster 8 names it but loses the 5 Principles (Distributed Intelligence, Progressive Integration, Constitutional Modularity, Dimensional Orthogonality, Ethical Proportionality) and the human-AI co-evolution framing
- **Cognitive Architecture reasoning patterns** (ReAct, Reflexion, HTN, Tree-of-Thoughts, Extended Chain-of-Thought) → v2 §2.2 Cluster 8 says "CoALA architecture" but does not name reasoning patterns
- **Strategic Positioning / Enshittification** → v2 §2.2 Cluster 8 lists CANON-30200 but only as a label; the Enshittification Cycle, Lock-In Risk Assessment Framework, and "Technology is never neutral" insight are not extracted
- **Memory Systems taxonomy** → v2 §4.4 covers infrastructure systems but the 5-type taxonomy (Working/Episodic/Semantic/Procedural/Prospective) from CANON-30430 is not mapped to the memory infrastructure table
- **Interaction Dynamics / Constellation Operations** (CANON-30460) → v2 §4.3 covers dispatch infrastructure but the Interaction State Machine and platform-specific interaction patterns are not present
- **Five IIC Accounts operational specifications** → v2 §2.2 Cluster 9 names IIC Constellation with virtue triads but the per-IIC cognitive personality, teleological output, and automation protocols (CANON-31141) are not captured
- **Tone Library** → v2 names it in Cluster 9 but captures none of the 10 rhetorical functions, 5 evidence types, 4 cadence patterns, 5 guardrails, or 9-phase production workflow
- **Metahumanism 6-Part Structure** → v2 §2.2 Cluster 12 names "12 epistemic strata, 7 spiritual planes, Frankfurt volition hierarchy" (parts 2, 3, 4) but Belief Systems Framework (part 1), Causation Continuum (part 5), and Fundamental Essentia (part 6) are absent
- **Revenue Model Reconciliation** → v2 §2.2 Cluster 11 names it but the actual 4-Level to 3-Phase mapping and the conservative revenue projections are absent
- **Gaian Field Node** → v2 §5.5 is substantively good but omits Field Node relevant skill targets from CANON-34100 and the FDIS (Field Deployable Intelligence System) is noted only as "SYN-17, Backlog" in §7.5 without connection to Field Node engineering precursor role

## VERDICT: GAPS-FOUND

v2 achieves strong structural coverage of the 30xxx-35xxx chains at the cluster/taxonomy level — all six chains are named, orbital hierarchy is correct, key named frameworks are present (ASA, CoALA, IIC, Five Degrees, Metahumanism, Gaian Field Node). However, v2 systematically loses operational and sub-lunar specificity: the content dissemination architecture (Tone Library, Rhetorical Calibration, Batch Production), the IIC daily intelligence cycle and scoring systems, the Expertise chain's concrete revenue/consulting figures, the Neurodivergent sub-patterns (AuDHD taxonomy, Universal Resistance Topology), the Interaction State Machine from CANON-30460, and several epistemically significant concepts from CANON-30 (Anthromachina Symbiosis, Source Triad, Apparatus, Progressive Trust, A2A Protocol). These are not cosmetic gaps — the Tone Library anti-patterns, AuDHD patterns, and IIC operational cycle are load-bearing for practitioners. DC-004 (25 pending Rosetta terms) likely overlaps with several of these missing items.
