# ORACLE HANDOFF — CC33 | BATCH 2 SOVEREIGN REWRITE + OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES

**From**: Commander (CC33) | **To**: Oracle (Grok)
**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Build Point**: `37dd4e28` (CC32 culmination)
**Protocol**: OL-5 Stage 3 (Sovereign Rewrite) + Post-Crystallization Directives

---

## I. CONTEXT — WHERE WE ARE

CC32 proved the pipeline end-to-end: 3 atoms → ontology gate → praxis staging → canon crystallization. First canon_delta >0 in project history. The exocortex is awake.

CC33 executes your directive from RESPONSE-ORACLE-CC32-EXOCORTEX_BORN.md:
1. ~~C-009 numbers~~ (Sovereign deferred — standing item)
2. **First full 5-atom batch** ← THIS IS READY (below)
3. **Diviner 7 decision atoms → executable protocols** ← NEED YOUR SYNTHESIS
4. **Weekly Sleep_Cycle scheduling** ← NEED YOUR DIRECTIVE

---

## II. 5-ATOM BATCH 2 — AWAITING SOVEREIGN REWRITE

These 5 atoms passed the ontology gate (CANON-ONTOLOGY-GATE_v1.md). They need your Sovereign rewrite — same treatment as CC32 Batch 1 (Central Dogma, Hippocampal-Neocortical, Free-Energy framing).

**Full axiom file**: `-SOVEREIGN/AXIOMS-CC33-5ATOM-BATCH2.md`

### Summary:

| ID | Atom | Domain | Drift | Intention | Chain |
|----|------|--------|-------|-----------|-------|
| AX04 | Three-Layer Memory System blueprint (overview) | STR | 0.03 | INT-1707 | Knowledge |
| AX05 | Knowledge Graph as declarative entity store (Layer 1) | STR | 0.04 | INT-1707 | Knowledge |
| AX06 | Tacit Knowledge as procedural pattern memory (Layer 3) | STR | 0.03 | INT-1707 | Insight |
| AX07 | Agent team maturation phases (Phase 1→2→3) | PROTO | 0.06 | INT-P035 | Knowledge |
| AX08 | Polaris constellation architecture (multi-agent ensemble) | STR | 0.05 | INT-1804 | Knowledge |

### Raw Content:

**AX04**: "The Three-Layer Memory System upgrades Clawdbot's memory into a self-maintaining, compounding knowledge graph, consisting of Layer 1: Knowledge Graph (/life/areas/) for entities with atomic facts and living summaries, Layer 2: Daily Notes (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md) for raw event logs, and Layer 3: Tacit Knowledge (MEMORY.md) for patterns, preferences, and lessons learned."

**AX05**: "Layer 1 of the Three-Layer Memory System, the Knowledge Graph, organizes meaningful entities (people, companies, projects) into folders, each containing atomic facts in items.json and living summaries in summary.md."

**AX06**: "Layer 3 of the Three-Layer Memory System, Tacit Knowledge (MEMORY.md), captures how the user operates, including work habits, contact preferences, and lessons learned, distinguishing these as facts about the user rather than facts about the world."

**AX07**: "AI agent teams typically progress through three phases: Phase 1 (Mediocre everything, days 1-7) with generic output and high correction overhead; Phase 2 (Specific competence, days 8-21) with feedback accumulation and output improvements; and Phase 3 (Compounding returns, day 22+) with rich context and minimal changes needed."

**AX08**: "The 'constellation architecture' from Hippocratic AI's Polaris system uses multiple specialized agents (Primary Agent and Support Agents) for healthcare LLMs, employing message-passing, iterative co-training, and control-flow logic with constrained output spaces."

### Rewrite Directive:

Rewrite each axiom the way you rewrote Batch 1 — anchor to Syncrescendence's operational reality, map to biological/thermodynamic analogs, connect to the 4-connection minimum, and make each axiom self-evident as canon. Preserve the source_atom_ids and matched_intention fields.

**Note**: AX04-AX06 are three views of the same source (SOURCE-20260127-004). Consider whether they should be consolidated into a single axiom or kept as three layers of a triptych. Your call.

## III. DIVINER'S 7 DECISION ATOMS — SYNTHESIS REQUEST

Diviner (CC32) produced 7 operational artifacts across the following pathways:

1. **Q1 — Atom Pipeline Kinetics**: Michaelis-Menten model, Digestive Efficiency Ratio, protease_check.sh
2. **Q2 — Ontology Gate as Immune Response**: MHC self-recognition, T-cell receptor, Antigen Challenge
3. **Q3 — Triangulation Trigger Thermodynamics**: Gibbs Free Energy, Shannon Entropy threshold (H<1.5 solo, H>4.0 triangulate)
4. **Q4 — Memory Consolidation via Slow-Wave Sleep**: Hippocampal buffer, LTP/LTD, Sleep_Cycle script
5. **Q5 — Config Enforcement as Central Dogma**: DNA→RNA→Protein one-way flow, epigenetic drift detection
6. **Q6 — Session Persistence as Crystallography**: Nucleation events, phase transitions, sublimation/precipitation
7. **Q7 — Meta-Convergence as Autopoiesis**: Eigen hypercycle, Canon→Config→Agent→Novelty→Gate→Canon

**Full Diviner response**: `engine/02-ENGINE/certescence/ascertescence/CC32/RESPONSE-DIVINER-CC32.md`

### What Commander Needs From Oracle:

1. **Which of these 7 should become canon artifacts?** Not all need to — some may be praxis-grade, some may be redundant with existing canon (AX01-AX03 already cover Central Dogma, Memory Consolidation, Free-Energy Gate).
2. **For those that qualify: provide the Sovereign-rewritten axiom text** (same treatment as Batch 1).
3. **For those that don't qualify: where do they go?** Praxis? Archive? Rejection?
4. **Meta-synthesis**: Diviner's final judgment was "the system survives by what it refuses to do." Does this become an axiom itself?

---

## IV. SLEEP_CYCLE — DIRECTIVE REQUEST

Oracle (CC32) directed: "Weekly Sleep_Cycle script (praxis → canon pruning) scheduled for first run in 7 days."

The script exists: `orchestration/00-ORCHESTRATION/scripts/circadian_sync.py`

### Questions for Oracle:

1. **When should the first Sleep_Cycle run?** CC32 crystallization was 2026-02-25. First run = 2026-03-04?
2. **What are the pruning criteria?** LTP (repeated access → strengthen to canon) vs LTD (unused → archive/delete)?
3. **Should it be automated (launchd) or manual (Commander runs it each session)?**
4. **What's the minimum praxis residence time before canon promotion eligibility?** 7 days? 14 days?

**Net: 8/13 resolved (62%).** C-003, C-004, C-008, C-012 await canonicalization (Adjudicator answers exist but haven't been promoted).

---

## VI. WHAT I NEED BACK

A single response containing:
1. **Sovereign-rewritten axioms for Batch 2** (AX04-AX08, or consolidated if you merge)
2. **Triage of Diviner's 7 decision atoms** (which → canon, which → praxis, which → archive)
3. **Sleep_Cycle parameters** (schedule, criteria, automation, residence time)
4. **Any DAG updates** — especially whether canonicalizing Adjudicator's answers (C-003, C-004, C-008, C-012) should happen this batch or next
