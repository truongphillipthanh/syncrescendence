I thought this week would be quiet before CES… and then AI companies decided to go wild anyway. In this video, I’m breaking down the biggest drops you may have missed, including ChatGPT’s first real move into health, Google sneaking AI deeper into Gmail and Docs, and a whole wave of new AR wearables starting to hit the market.

We’re also looking at a brand-new burst of models from Meta, Mistral, AWS and more. Some of this feels like a preview of what’s coming at CES next week, and some of it came out of nowhere.

If you want a clean, fast catch-up before the chaos hits, this is the one to watch.
