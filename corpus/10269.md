## Post 2: Example 1 - Prompting Techniques for ChatGPT

**Example 1:** "/last30days prompting techniques for **@ChatGPTapp** for legal questions"

It surfaced a dominant pattern: hallucination prevention (fake citations can lead to real-world fines or embarrassment).

So it generates prompts that ground sources, enforce "if unsure, say so," constrain scope, and produce structured issue-spotting outputs.

**Example 2:** "/last30days best **@openclaw** use cases"

You get what people actually do with it, plus engagement signals.

Top themes: email/calendar automation, task management via chat, overnight coding agent, smart home + life admin, browser automation.

Plus the stats block (threads, likes, reposts, top voices) so you can see what's real.

## Post 4: Example 3 - Photorealistic Portrait Prompting

**Example 3:** "/last30days photorealistic people in **@NanoBanana**"

It found that viral prompts are mostly structured JSON (lens, lighting, skin texture, negatives).

And it outputs copy-paste JSON that reliably produces things like consistent multi-panel "aging grid" portraits.
