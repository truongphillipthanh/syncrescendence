> The author used the arscontexta system itself to derive a clean version of their workflow from their methodology, as their internal version was cluttered with personal projects.

## Concept (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-002-0001
**Lines**: 7-7
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.10, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.00, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.90

> A second brain is a method of structuring information to facilitate retrieval, grouping, and building upon existing knowledge.

**Lines**: 25-27
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.50

> arscontexta functions as an engine for an agent's second brain, generating an individualized knowledge system that adapts to the user's thinking style and evolving needs, rather than providing a fixed template.

## Framework (1)
