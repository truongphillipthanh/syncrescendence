## Notable Patterns

### Structural Patterns

1. **Parallel sixfold structure**: Six chains, six dimensions, six planetary correspondences, six elements (Air×2, Water, Fire, Earth, Quintessence) — the number six is architecturally load-bearing.

2. **Fivefold staging**: Five Stage levels (Forum→Portico), five Phase names, five ASIA Federation states, five IIC accounts — five governs social/institutional progression.

3. **4-stage modal/scale system**: Four modals, four scale levels (Micro/Meso/Macro/Meta), four Sovereign Lattice coordinates — four governs temporal/spatial framing.

4. **Cosmo-terrestrial naming**: Cosmos-level canon uses celestial names (cosmos, lattice, planetary, lunar, satellite, asteroid). Practice-level canon uses terrestrial/architectural names (Palace, Pillar, Rail, Forum, Amphitheatre). The metaphor system is bilingual.

5. **Metabolic language**: Corpus consistently uses biological/metabolic language (metabolism, defrag, digest, pulse, coil, integration, dissolution) rather than mechanical language. This is deliberate anti-mechanistic framing.

6. **Recursive self-reference**: The system documents its own evolution (CANON-00004), evaluates its own irresolutions (CANON-00007), constitutes its own governance (CANON-00017), and audits its own corpus (CANON-00006). Full reflexivity is structural, not incidental.

### Naming Conventions

- File prefix: `CANON-{5-digit-code}-{TOPIC}-cosmos.md`
- Five-digit codes: first two digits = tier (00=cosmos, 10/11=core, 20+=lattice, 30+=chain/planetary/lunar/satellite)
- Frontmatter field `entities_defined` provides typed entity declarations (CON/STR/PROTO/MET/WF/NOT/ART/TOOL)
- All entity definitions carry a 3-char type code prefix

### Version Patterns

- v2.3 / v2.3.0 = current Annealment cycle versions (post-Metabolic Defrag, post-Oracle 8)
- v1.0.0 = original or recovered documents (CANON-00001/02/03/04/15/16/17)
- v3.0.0 = CANON-00007 only (most evolved evaluation document, multiple adjudication cycles)

### Content Architecture

- Four oversized files (>100KB each): CANON-00005, 00007, 00012, 00014 — the four highest-complexity operational domains (originary scripture, evaluation, modal sequence, content protocol)
- Thirteen fully-readable files form the navigational/structural skeleton
- The sn/ subdirectory is a pure mirror (no unique content) — likely a secondary navigation surface or historical snapshot
