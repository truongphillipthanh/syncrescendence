## Description (no transcript available)

Anthropic just dropped Claude Cowork—essentially Claude Code for everyone, not just engineers—and we got to chat about it with a product engineer at Anthropic who helped build it.

In this live Vibe Check, Dan Shipper and Kieran Klaassen explore the new interface together, testing what works (and what doesn't) in real time. Anthropic’s Felix Rieseberg joins midway through to explain the philosophy behind Cowork's design: why it separates "Tasks" from "Chats," how the queue system lets you send messages while the agent is working, and what "agent-native" architecture means in practice. They also dig into Skills—Claude's prompt system that lets you customize how it works—and the Chrome connector for browser automation.

This is a raw, unfiltered first look at what might be the future of how knowledge workers interact with AI: async workflows instead of turn-by-turn chat.
