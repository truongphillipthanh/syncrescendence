# Xcode 26.3 MCP Integration Thread

You can give Claude Code or Codex access to Xcode 26.3's (new?) MCP, which is super awesome because Apple is letting you choose which tool chain to use.

**CC:**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio xcode -- xcrun mcpbridge
```

**Codex:**
```bash
codex mcp add xcode -- xcrun mcpbridge
```

Not sure - I haven't messed with it yet. Just for 26.3 installed.
