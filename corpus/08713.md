# STANDARDS: The 18 Evaluative Lenses
## Decision Framework for Syncrescendence
**Generated**: 2025-12-31 (Oracle7)
**Purpose**: Provide consistent evaluation criteria for all strategic decisions
**Status**: Constitutional — do not modify without Sovereign approval

---

## OVERVIEW

Every strategic decision must be evaluated against these 18 lenses. A decision that fails more than 6 lenses should be reconsidered.

**Scoring**:
- ✓ = Passes (supports this principle)
- ⚠️ = Neutral/Mixed (neither supports nor contradicts)
- ✗ = Fails (contradicts this principle)

**Threshold**: Minimum 12/18 lenses must pass for approval.

---

## PROCEDURAL STANDARD BEARER

Operational process quality and throughput hardening are governed by:
- `orchestration/state/REF-PROCEDURAL_STANDARD_BEARER.md`

Use this standard when:
- codifying operating doctrine into durable process,
- reinforcing execution quality gates,
- deciding what repetitive work must be automated.

## THE ORIGINAL NINE (Oracle4)

### 1. Syncrescendent Route
**Question**: Does this follow the continuous, recursive amplification path?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Does it maintain continuity with prior decisions?
- Does it enable future evolution?
- Does it serve the civilizational sensing infrastructure vision?

**Red Flags**:
- Discontinuities that break accumulated context
- Dead ends that don't enable future growth
- Scope reduction that abandons the mission

---

### 2. Bitter Lesson Scaling
**Question**: Does this leverage computation rather than hand-crafted features?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Will this scale with increasing model capability?
- Does it rely on general methods over specific solutions?
- Will it become MORE valuable as AI improves?

**Red Flags**:
- Hand-crafted rules that AI will obsolete
- Solutions that fight model nature
- Complexity that doesn't scale

**The Bitter Lesson** (Sutton): "The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective."

---

### 3. Antifragile
**Question**: Does this gain from disorder rather than merely resist it?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Will disruption strengthen this?
- Does it improve through failure and iteration?
- Is it designed for volatility, not stability?

**Red Flags**:
- Fragile dependencies
- Single points of failure
- Rigidity disguised as stability

**Antifragile Spectrum**: Fragile (breaks under stress) → Robust (resists stress) → Antifragile (gains from stress)

---

### 4. Meet the Moment
**Question**: Does this serve current needs while preparing for future states?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Is this relevant NOW (Modal 1 era)?
- Does it avoid premature optimization?
- Does it prepare for Modal 2/3 without blocking current progress?

**Red Flags**:
- Future-proofing that sacrifices present utility
- Present-focus that ignores trajectory
- Temporal misalignment

---

### 5. Steelman & Redteam
**Question**: Has this been subjected to the strongest possible challenge?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- What's the best argument AGAINST this?
- What would have to be true for this to fail?
- What's the strongest alternative?

**Red Flags**:
- Strawman dismissals of alternatives

**Process**:
1. State the strongest version of opposing view
2. Identify conditions that would make this fail
3. Document why chosen approach is still preferred

---

### 6. Personal Idiosyncrasies
**Question**: Does this respect the Sovereign's cognitive profile?

**Sovereign's Profile**:
- AuDHD cognitive pattern
- Macroscopic-holistic processing first, then distillation
- High verbal working memory, abstract-sequential dominant
- Requires external scaffolding for execution

- Does it externalize executive function?

**Red Flags**:
- Premature reduction before holistic view
- Sequential-only processing assumptions
- Demands on working memory without scaffolding

---

### 7. Potency Without Resolution Loss
**Question**: Does this maintain power without sacrificing nuance?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Is the full complexity preserved?
- Can the original be reconstructed from this?
- Has compression introduced distortion?

**Red Flags**:
- Oversimplification that loses signal
- Compression that introduces artifacts
- Abstraction that obscures mechanism

---

### 8. Elegance + Developer Happiness
**Question**: Is this simple, clear, and satisfying to work with?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Is the mental model intuitive?
- Does it spark joy to use?
- Would a sophisticated practitioner appreciate it?

**Red Flags**:
- Unnecessary complexity
- Obscure conventions
- Frustrating interaction patterns

---

### 9. Agentify + Human-Navigable
**Question**: Can both AI agents and humans effectively use this?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Can an agent parse and traverse this autonomously?
- Can a human understand it in 5 minutes?
- Maximum 2 decisions to any file?

**Red Flags**:
- Agent-hostile structures
- Human-hostile naming
- Deep nesting requiring many decisions

---

## THE EXTENDED NINE (Oracle6)

### 10. First Principles
**Question**: What are the fundamental truths here?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- What's the irreducible core?
- What assumptions are we making?
- What would Aristotle ask?

**Process**:
1. List all assumptions
2. Challenge each assumption
3. Build up from bedrock truths

---

### 11. Systems Thinking
**Question**: How do the parts relate to the whole?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- What are the feedback loops?
- What are the emergent properties?
- Where are the leverage points?

**Red Flags**:
- Isolated component thinking
- Ignoring side effects
- Missing feedback loops

---

### 12. Industrial Engineering
**Question**: How do we minimize waste and maximize throughput?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- What's the bottleneck?
- What's the rework rate?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Can we ship something small and learn?
- Is feedback built into the process?
- Can we pivot if needed?

**Red Flags**:
- Big bang releases
- No feedback mechanism
- Rigid commitment to plan

---

### 17. Lean
**Question**: What's the waste here?

**Seven Wastes** (adapted):
1. Overproduction — Creating more than needed
2. Waiting — Blocked work
3. Transportation — Unnecessary movement
4. Over-processing — More precision than required
5. Inventory — Accumulated unprocessed items
6. Motion — Unnecessary steps
7. Defects — Errors requiring correction

## APPLICATION METHODOLOGY

### Step 1: State the Decision
Clearly articulate what is being decided.

### Step 2: Apply Each Lens
For each of the 18 lenses:
- Score (✓/⚠️/✗)
- Provide brief rationale

### Step 3: Calculate Score
Count passes (✓). Threshold is 12/18.

### Step 4: Evaluate Failures
For any lens that fails:
- Is this a critical failure or acceptable tradeoff?
- Can the decision be modified to pass this lens?

### Step 5: Document
Record in ORACLE_DECISIONS.md with full evaluation.

| 3. Antifragile | ✗ | Loses value with each new release |
| 4. Meet the Moment | ✗ | October 2025 is already outdated |
| 5. Steelman/Redteam | ⚠️ | Could argue historical value |
| 6. Personal Idiosyncrasies | ✗ | Doesn't serve workflow |
| 7. Potency w/o Resolution Loss | ✗ | Losing potency daily |
| 8. Elegance + Dev Happiness | ⚠️ | Reference utility only |
| 9. Agentify + Human-Navigable | ✗ | Stale data misleads agents |
| 10. First Principles | ✗ | Contingent on current state |
| 11. Systems Thinking | ✗ | Disconnected snapshot |
| 12. Industrial Engineering | ✗ | Requires constant updates |
| 13. Complexity Theory | ✗ | Accidental complexity (temporal) |
| 14. Permaculture | ✗ | Requires constant maintenance |
| 15. Design Thinking | ⚠️ | - |
| 16. Agile | ✗ | Snapshot resists iteration |
