## Description (no transcript available)

Dr. David Eagleman, PhD, is a neuroscientist, bestselling author and professor at Stanford University. We discuss how to leverage the science of neuroplasticity to learn new skills and information and how accurate and false memories form and are forgotten. We also discuss time perception and why it speeds up or slows down depending on our age and stress level. We cover dreaming and the meaning of visual and other dream content. And we discuss the neuroscience of cultural and political polarization and how to remedy it. This episode provides science-based knowledge and practical tools you can use to enhance learning and better understand your experience of life in the past, present and future.
