## Description (no transcript available)

Why can you see better than today’s AI? The answer lies in neural processes that are absent from today’s machine-learning architectures. In this video, we demonstrate how the visual system constructs boundaries, selects angles, and identifies corners using mechanisms that have no direct analogue in current AI.  These unique insights apply to many AI technologies and will lead to huge increases in AI efficiency. And even dedicated AI researchers and neuroscientists will not find these insights anywhere else.
