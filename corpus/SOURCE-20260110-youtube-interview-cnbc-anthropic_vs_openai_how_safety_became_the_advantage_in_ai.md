## Description (no transcript available)

Daniela and Dario Amodei left OpenAI five years ago to form Anthropic, a company focused on AI safety and enterprise. Since then, the Claude creator's revenue has grown 10x annually for three straight years, with 85% coming from business customers — the inverse of OpenAI's consumer-heavy model. Daniela Amodei, the company's president and co-founder, has emerged as the operational counterweight to her brother Dario's technical vision. CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos interviews Daniela and other experts, and breaks down how Anthropic quietly rose to the top of the AI race.
