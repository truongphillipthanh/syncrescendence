In this video, I combine Obsidian Bases and Workspaces to transform Obsidian into 4 powerful modes that fit different ways of thinking: the Inner Guide Mode for mapping the world inside and around you, Producer Mode for focused action and getting things done, Synthesizer Mode for combining ideas in ways no one else can, and Creative Mode for bringing your best work to life. The best part? You can switch between these modes in just one click, giving you a superpower for changing your cognitive context instantly.
