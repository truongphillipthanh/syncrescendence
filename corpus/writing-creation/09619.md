## Description (no transcript available)

Pedro Domingos, author of the bestselling book "The Master Algorithm," introduces his latest work: Tensor Logic - a new programming language he believes could become the fundamental language for artificial intelligence.

Think of it like this: Physics found its language in calculus. Circuit design found its language in Boolean logic. Pedro argues that AI has been missing its language - until now.

Current AI is split between two worlds that don't play well together:

Deep Learning (neural networks, transformers, ChatGPT) - great at learning from data, terrible at logical reasoning
Symbolic AI (logic programming, expert systems) - great at logical reasoning, terrible at learning from messy real-world data

Tensor Logic unifies both. It's a single language where you can:
Write logical rules that the system can actually learn and modify
Do transparent, verifiable reasoning (no hallucinations)
Mix "fuzzy" analogical thinking with rock-solid deduction

The Killer Feature: The Temperature Knob

Why Should You Care?

Pedro makes a provocative claim: 01:24:50 → 01:27:47 “We've wasted trillions of dollars” on brute-force compute because we're ignoring 40 years of AI research. Companies are "reinventing reasoning" when they could just read a textbook and save billions.
