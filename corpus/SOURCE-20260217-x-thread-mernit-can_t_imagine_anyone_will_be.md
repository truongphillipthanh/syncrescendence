can't imagine anyone will be using this to automate their work 6 months from now
(Description: A detailed workflow diagram showing a comprehensive automation pipeline. The diagram displays the following components connected in sequence:
Top row: Schedule Trigger → settings → Last 30d push history → Last 24h trending repo → Filter out pushed repos → Calc top repos → Github Repo README
Second row: Github Repo Summarize → Merge Markdown → (connects to multiple branches below)
Third row branches show:
- Left branch: Markdown → Send Email
- Middle branch: Generate Description → Create file
- Right branch: Translate to EN → Generate Description EN → Create EN file
Bottom component: Google Gemini Chat Model (gemini 2.5 flash preview)
The diagram uses icons for different operation types: triggers, settings, data operations, code blocks, and external integrations. Connections show data flow between operations with both solid and dashed lines indicating different types of relationships.)
