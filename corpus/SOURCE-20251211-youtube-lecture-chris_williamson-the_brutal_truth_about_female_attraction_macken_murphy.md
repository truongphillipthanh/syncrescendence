## Description (no transcript available)

Macken Murphy is an evolutionary biologist at the University of Melbourne, a writer and a podcaster.

Modern dating is in the middle of a cultural reset. Attraction science is evolving, men and women are changing how they show up, and everyone is trying to build healthier relationships. What does the data actually say, and is a more balanced way of dating within reach?

Expect to learn what the science says about if size actually matters, if tall men cheat more, what the impact of body count on long term relationship success is, the big problem with having “ideal” mate preferences, why men are becoming more concerned with attractiveness and beautification, the benefits women gain or lose when they’re non-monogamous, what the “Rich Gay Uncle” hypothesis for homosexuality is and much more
