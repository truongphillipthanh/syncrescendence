What's really happening with AI and software architecture? The common story is that architecture requires human wisdom and creative judgment that AI can't match—but the reality is more complicated.

In this video, I share the inside scoop on why AI may have structural advantages over humans for certain architectural work:

 • Why most system failures trace back to lost context, not bad judgment
 • How human working memory limits create predictable architectural blind spots
 • What AI agents can do when holding an entire codebase in attention
 • Where human architects remain irreplaceable for novel decisions and trade-offs

For engineering teams, the opportunity isn't replacement—it's designing AI partnerships that address the entropy humans were always going to lose to anyway.
