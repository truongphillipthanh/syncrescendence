## Claim (5)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260207-011-0003
**Lines**: 17-20
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.20, consensus_pressure=0.80, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.90

> For approximately 15 years, cloud services were a minor operational expense (3-5% of OpEx) and were treated as a utility that companies were comfortable outsourcing.

**Lines**: 22-25
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.70

> AI fundamentally alters the nature of cloud services by making compute a primary input across all core business functions, including R&D, product development, customer support, sales automation, personalization, pricing, and internal operations.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260207-011-0006
**Lines**: 31-35
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.60, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Companies that rent compute from hyperscalers without priority, long-term reservations, or leverage are effectively tenants, not true customers, especially when compute dictates their roadmap, margins, and time-to-market.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260207-011-0008
**Lines**: 41-42
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Many companies will be unable to build their own compute infrastructure due to a lack of supply lines, not a lack of intent.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260207-011-0009
**Lines**: 44-48
**Context**: consensus / evidence
**Tension**: novelty=0.60, consensus_pressure=0.70, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Hyperscalers are acquiring control, not just GPUs, by pre-buying capacity, securing relationships and volume commitments with NVIDIA, and owning the power, interconnect, facilities, and sticky software layers.

## Concept (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260207-011-0002
**Lines**: 15-15
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.50

> Compute is transitioning from a utility to a strategic weapon, capable of defending or attacking a company's market position.

## Framework (1)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260207-011-0010
**Lines**: 50-52
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.50

> A flywheel effect is created where companies realize compute is strategic, attempt to secure it, face difficulties, retreat to the cloud, increasing cloud priority and pricing power, which then spikes urgency and repeats the cycle.

## Prediction (3)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260207-011-0001
**Lines**: 8-11
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.30

> The decline in the IGV (software index) due to AI eroding SaaS moats is only the beginning of a much larger disruption over the next few years.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260207-011-0005
**Lines**: 27-28
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.40

> When compute costs increase from ~3% to 15-30%+ of OpEx, it will transform from an IT line item into a strategic asset.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260207-011-0007
**Lines**: 37-39
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.40

> Some companies will soon initiate plans to build their own on-premise compute infrastructure, with intentions to expand it over time, to avoid being tenants for a significant portion of their corporate strategy.
