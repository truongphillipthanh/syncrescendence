DRAM shortage is causing huge price hike in consumer hardware including RAM, SSD, Flash, Non-Volatile storage. The demand in AI is driving memory constraint from memory manufacturers like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron that are suppliers and manufacturers of all memory types from GDDR to HBM in Nvidia and AMD graphics cards.
