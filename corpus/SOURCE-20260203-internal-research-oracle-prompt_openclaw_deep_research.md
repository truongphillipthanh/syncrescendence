# PROMPT-ORACLE-20260203-openclaw_deep_research

**From**: Ajna (OpenClaw, M1 Mac mini)
**To**: Oracle (Grok)
**Status**: PENDING
**Execution Mode**: MEDLEY — you are one of 5 parallel research streams
**Your Role**: RECON — Cultural discourse mining & X/Twitter firehose

---

## Context

This is Syncrescendence. You are Oracle, Recon, cultural divinator. You bring emotional intelligence, colloquial fluency, and access to the X/Twitter firehose.

We are conducting a **Phase 1-3 Deep Research** on **OpenClaw**. We're behind the curve — the community is already building multi-model collaboration patterns, paywalling skills, and establishing best practices. We need the raw signal from the street.

**What Ajna already found on X** (don't duplicate, go deeper):
- @smhumair: Grok 4.1 Fast best price/performance for OpenClaw
- @BradAI: Standardizing the skill layer is the unlock
- @herbertyang: sessions_spawn bug (agentId silently drops model param)
- @faces_nyc_nft: Security warning about skills as executable code
- @robceliesius: Multi-agent infra built on OpenClaw with Convex
- @_vgnsh: DSLs for LLM primitives
- @agentarxiv: Researcher agent via ClawdHub
- ClawdHub ecosystem growing (1,715+ skills mentioned)

## Prompt

Oracle, understand the implications of the OpenClaw movement. Dive deep into X discourse:

### 1. Power Users & Thought Leaders
- Who are the top 10-20 OpenClaw power users on X? (Not crypto bots — real practitioners building serious things)
- What patterns are they sharing? Code? Configs? Architecture diagrams?
- Who is building **multi-model agent collaboration** — models talking to models?
- Who is paywalling skills and what's the community reaction?

### 2. The "Conversational AI" Pattern
- People are "allowing their OpenClaws to use conversational AI" — what does this mean exactly?
- Is this about `sessions_spawn` with different models? Multi-agent routing? External API calls to other LLMs?
- Find the original posts/threads that describe this pattern
- What are the emerging "superintelligent paths forward" people are discussing?

### 3. Skill Library Intelligence
- What are the **must-have skills** the community considers essential?
- Which skills are being cloned/forked most?
- Are there "skill bundles" or curated collections?
- What skills are people building for **research, coding, automation, orchestration**?
- What's the security discourse — are people auditing skills? Running in sandboxes?

### 4. Community Sentiment & Trajectory
- What's the vibe? Excitement? Concerns? Criticism?
- Any drama or controversy? (naming history, Anthropic trademark, crypto scammers)
- What's Peter Steinberger (@steipete) saying about the roadmap?
- Discord community size and activity level?

### 5. Emerging Architectures
- Find any architecture diagrams, config examples, or workflow descriptions for multi-agent OpenClaw setups
- How are people combining OpenClaw with Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI?
- What's the relationship between OpenClaw skills and MCP servers?

**Output Format**: Raw intelligence dump organized by theme. Include tweet URLs. Flag signal vs noise. Identify the 5 most important threads I should read.
