Today’s show: 

On Today’s action packed episode of This Week in Startups, our team is going full AI!

Jason is joined by Oliver Korzen and Lukas Durand from the LAUNCH team, alongside Rahul Sood, founder/CEO of Irrevernt Labs and founder of Voodoo PC.

With the rise of Clawdbot/Moltbot, the question on everyone’s mind is how fast, how much and how safe! Lukas and Oliver show off the ways that This Week in Startups are automating the hours of research and administrative tasks that take up our days and the what this means for running a podcast and venture firm.

Then, Rahul Sood comes on to run through the massive security risks of running a fully authorized Clawdbot, from injection attacks to terminator like behavior. But, Rahul also comes with the strategy to deploy agents in a low risk manner — keep it silo’d!

Jason and Rahul break down what this means for employment and the future of work. Jobs will get more exciting as the truly human elements left (creativity and thoughtfulness) will become be the only thing left to do. Unfortunately, this will likely leave many unemployed.
