"Claude Code, use Agent Teams to explore the `claude` binary and tell me all the codenames and unreleased features"

— Tengu: Claude code
— Penguin Mode: fast mode
— Grove: privacy/data system
— Amber Flint: agent teams
— Marble Anvil: thinking edits

Peek into what's to come.

(Description: A dark-themed technical table titled "Top Unreleased Features" with 11 rows and 4 columns. The table displays:

| # | Feature | Status | How to Try |

| 1 | Speculative Execution | Active, gated | Runs automatically – pre-executes likely tool calls before you approve |
| 2 | LSP Tool | Inv-gated, unreleased | ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1 – would give Claude go-to-definition, find-references |
| 3 | Teleport | In binary, partially gated | Cross-device session resume with git-branch awareness |
