## Description (no transcript available)

From cofounding LinkedIn to backing OpenAI early, Reid Hoffman is in the habit of being right about the future, so we wanted to know what he saw coming in 2026.

In his third appearance on AI & I, Hoffman lays out his predictions for where AI will go in the 12 months ahead. He talks to Dan Shipper about how agents will break out of coding into other domains and who’s winning the coding agent race. They also get into how Hoffman defines artificial general intelligence, the way he believes enterprises will use AI, and why public debate on AI might turn more negative, even as the technology becomes more empowering for individuals.

Hoffman’s other bets on the future include cofounding AI drug discovery startup Manas AI, investing at venture capital firm Greylock Partners, writing books, and hosting the Masters of Scale podcast. He’s also an investor at Every.
