> Perplexity improving search is like making the horse faster, while the real shift will be akin to inventing the car, eliminating the need for the horse altogether.

> Sora, while generating stunning video, optimizes for a version of 'content creation' defined before AI existed, assuming the artifact remains a video rather than questioning what might replace video entirely.

> Perplexity, despite improving search with citations and clean answers, is still an 'answer machine' that requires users to ask questions, rather than eliminating the need to ask in the first place.

> The open-weight model race (Mistral, LLaMA) focuses on optimizing the transformer architecture, which is twelve years old, rather than questioning the foundational 'chassis' of AI models.

> Genuine breakthroughs that reshape daily life often don't announce themselves in the language of the things they replace, like the smartphone not being marketed as a 'better PDA' or Google as a 'better directory'.
