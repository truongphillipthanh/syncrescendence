## Description (no transcript available)

Javi walks through a logging refactor and shows why Codex's self-verification is a step change: the model runs the app, finds the right session, and proves logs still flow.

Takeaways:
- Codex can validate its work by running tests and launching the app.
- It excels at broad refactors that touch many files.
- The model can find session IDs and query tools on its own.
- Verification collapses a risky manual loop into minutes.

When the agent can prove correctness, you can move faster with less risk.
