# Codex checks its work for you

## Description (no transcript available)

Javi walks through a logging refactor and shows why Codex's self-verification is a step change: the model runs the app, finds the right session, and proves logs still flow.

Takeaways:
- Codex can validate its work by running tests and launching the app.
- It excels at broad refactors that touch many files.
- The model can find session IDs and query tools on its own.
- Verification collapses a risky manual loop into minutes.

When the agent can prove correctness, you can move faster with less risk.

Chapters:
00:00 Why Codex has been a step change
00:18 Self-verification: run tests and launch the app
00:52 The task: a logging refactor across many files
01:10 The risk: do not break observability
01:28 How this used to be verified manually
01:35 Ask the model to verify logs end-to-end
01:50 It finds the session ID and queries logs MCP
02:03 Proof: logs still pipe, task done fast
