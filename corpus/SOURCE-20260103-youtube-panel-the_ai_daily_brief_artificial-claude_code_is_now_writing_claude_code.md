XAI accelerates the compute arms race with a third MacroHarder facility targeting nearly two gigawatts of training power and hundreds of thousands of GPUs. OpenAI refocuses on advanced audio models and a voice-first consumer device. NVIDIA’s $5 billion Intel investment, SoftBank’s DigitalBridge acquisition, Brookfield’s AI cloud spin-off, and ClaudeCode’s claim of writing 100% of recent code signal massive infrastructure investment and a seismic shift in software engineering.
