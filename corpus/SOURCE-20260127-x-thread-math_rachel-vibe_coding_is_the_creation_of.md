# Vibe Coding Thread

Vibe coding is the creation of large quantities of complex AI-generated code. Executives push lay-offs claiming AI can handle the work. Managers pressure employees to meet quotas of how much of their code must be AI-generated... yet results are far from what was promised 1/

"When [I first got] hooked on Claude, I did not sleep. I spent two months excessively prompting the thing & wasting tokens. I ended up building & building & creating a ton of tools I did not end up using much..." - @mitsuhiko described his experience of "agent psychosis" 2/

When coding, many of us experience a state of flow: full absorption & energized focus. One's skills are adequate to cope with challenges, in a rule-bound system that provides clear clues on performance

On the surface, vibe coding seems to induce a similar flow. However... 3/

Vibe coding & gambling violate several characteristics needed for true flow:
- lack clear clues on how well you are performing (both provide misleading losses disguised as wins)
- match between challenge level and skill level is murky
- false sense of control  4/

Not all highly absorbed focus is flow. Researchers on gambling addiction have coined the term "dark flow". In a 2014 interview, Csikszentmihalyi defined a concept of "junk flow". 5/

(Description: Academic paper header with title "Dark Flow, Depression and Multiline Slot Machine Play" listing authors Mike J Dixon, Madison Stange, Chanel J Larche, Candice Graydon, Jonathan A Fuglsang, and Kevin A Harrigan. Below is the Abstract section explaining that multiline slot machines allow for loss disguised as win (LDW) outcomes. The text highlights: "These outcomes also create a 'smoother' experience for the player that seems to promote a highly absorbing, flow-like state that we have called 'dark flow'. Past research has indicated that there may be a relationship between problem gambling status and dark flow, as well as between dark flow, depression, and gambling expectancies.")

With dark flow we lose our ability to accurately assess our productivity levels & work quality. When developers used AI tools, they estimated that they were working 20% faster, yet in reality they worked 19% slower. Study from @METR_Evals 6/

(Description: Chart titled "Against Expert Forecasts and Developer Self-Reports, Early-2025 AI Shows Down Experienced Open-Source Developers" from METR. The chart shows change in time when AI is believed on y-axis (-50% to +40%) versus different forecast categories on x-axis. Green dots with error bars show forecasts (Economics expert forecasts ~40%, ML expert forecasts ~35%, Developer forecasts during study ~20%, Developer estimates after study ~20%), while a red dot shows the Observed result at approximately -20%.)

I work at an AI company, and we use AI every day. AI is useful! However, we approach vibe coding with caution and have seen that much can go wrong. Don't completely abandon the development of your current skillset. 7/

Dario Amodei said 90% of all code would be AI-written by Sept 2025. Sundar Pichai & Jeff Dean said everyone would use neural architecture search by 2023. Geoffrey Hinton said AI would replace radiologists by 2021. 8/

The image shows a photo of Dario Amodei speaking at a conference podium.)

Part of the appeal of vibe coding is extrapolation about how effective it will be in the future (including its ability to manage ever increasing complexity). But the tech industry has a long history of overpromising & overhyping products. 9/

AI coding agents produce syntactically correct code. However, they don't produce useful layers of abstraction nor meaningful modularization. They don't value conciseness or improving organization in a large code base. We have automated coding, but not software engineering. 10/

I revisited the work of Csikszentmihalyi on Flow and of researchers studying gambling addiction to better understand how vibe coding impacts us. 11/
