Tired of building AI features that work great locally but collapse when you try to integrate them into your production backend? Time to stop building a single, stressed out monolith agent and hire a specialized squad. 

Join Amit Maraj as he breaks down how Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A) to build complex features with loop agents, sequential agents, and judges that communicate seamlessly over web standards, turning any AI logic into reliable, connectable components.
