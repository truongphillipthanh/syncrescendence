## Description (no transcript available)

Coding agents have advanced dramatically in the last year, and can for example now run for a week to write 3 million lines of code. These are systems that write code autonomously, with very little human input. There are quite a few out there, including Cursor, Codex, and Claude Code, and they are starting to get much more widely used.

This level of automation means that software engineering is undergoing a dramatic change in how it works. Junior positions are vanishing, and even senior developers can start to see the writing on the wall. How long until asking a human to write code seems antiquated? The cost of developing software is going to near zero.

Unfortunately, rapid development of agents is exactly the type of AI capability advance that could be most dangerous. As is discussed in AI safety literature like AI 2027, agents are dangerous because we delegate capabilities to them and they act very quickly. And we still don't have a way to see inside and understand the motivations of agents. We discuss how this could lead humanity into a dangerous future.
