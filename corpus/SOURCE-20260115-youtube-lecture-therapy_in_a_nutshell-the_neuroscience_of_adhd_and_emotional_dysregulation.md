If you have ADHD and your emotions feel overwhelming, fast, or hard to control—you’re not broken, lazy, or “too sensitive.”
In this episode of Therapy in a Nutshell, I explain the brain science behind ADHD and emotional dysregulation—including delayed prefrontal cortex development, dopamine and norepinephrine differences, rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD), and why emotions can hit before your “brakes” have time to turn on.
Up to 70% of people with ADHD struggle with emotional regulation, and there are real neurological reasons why. I’ll break down:
Why ADHD emotions feel so intense and reactive
How executive dysfunction affects impulse control, frustration tolerance, and emotional recovery
What rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD) is and why criticism can feel physically painful
Biological triggers that worsen emotional dysregulation (sleep, hunger, sensory overload)
ADHD emotional “superpowers” that often get overlooked

Most importantly, I’ll share 9 practical, ADHD-friendly skills you can use to regulate emotions—even when your brain is doing ADHD things. These are strategies I use personally and with clients to slow reactions, calm the nervous system, support working memory, and respond instead of react.
You don’t need to “try harder.” You need systems that work with your brain.
📌 Topics covered: ADHD emotional dysregulation, emotional impulsivity, executive dysfunction, RSD, ADHD brain science, emotion regulation skills, rejection sensitivity, nervous system regulation.

In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction. 
And deeper than all of that, the Gospel of Jesus Christ orients my personal worldview and sense of security, peace, hope, and love https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe
