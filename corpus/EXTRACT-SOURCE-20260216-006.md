## Claim (4)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-006-0001
**Lines**: 4-5
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.80, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.30

> In 2027, building software is essentially free, making it difficult for software companies to differentiate themselves or justify purchases based solely on code.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-006-0003
**Lines**: 22-26
**Context**: speculation / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.70, consensus_pressure=0.40, contradiction_load=0.20, speculation_risk=0.70, actionability=0.30, epistemic_stability=0.40

> When software development becomes free, traditional moats like scale advantages in commodity features, proprietary datasets, integration complexity, and network effects around settled products dissolve.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-006-0004
**Lines**: 27-28
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.30, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.40, actionability=0.50, epistemic_stability=0.70

> What provides a lasting competitive advantage is knowledge that can only be learned by operating in a system that keeps changing, rather than code or data collected by observation.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-006-0006
**Lines**: 54-57
**Context**: consensus / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.40, consensus_pressure=0.60, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.20, actionability=0.10, epistemic_stability=0.80

> A simulation that accurately responds to actions and surfaces new failure modes like reality would effectively become the system itself, not a mere simulation.

## Concept (2)

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-006-0002
**Lines**: 20-21
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.30, actionability=0.40, epistemic_stability=0.60

> The term "scar tissue" refers to knowledge that can only be acquired by operating within a constantly changing system, learning from unexpected problems and adaptations.

### ATOM-SOURCE-20260216-006-0005
**Lines**: 47-49
**Context**: hypothesis / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.80, consensus_pressure=0.20, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.20, epistemic_stability=0.70

> Scar tissue is operational knowledge earned in a coupled, shifting system where the current state isn't self-explanatory, and it cannot be studied or rushed.

## Praxis Hook (1)

**Lines**: 58-58
**Context**: method / claim
**Tension**: novelty=0.50, consensus_pressure=0.50, contradiction_load=0.10, speculation_risk=0.10, actionability=0.70, epistemic_stability=0.80

> To simulate is to operate.
