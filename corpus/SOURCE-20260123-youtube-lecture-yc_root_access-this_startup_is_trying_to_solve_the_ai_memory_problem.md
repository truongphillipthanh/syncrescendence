## Description (no transcript available)

While LLMs continue to evolve, they still struggle with memory. The startup Mem0 is working to change that by building the memory layer for AI agents. In this episode of Founder Firesides, YC’s Nicolas Dessaigne sat down with co-founders Taranjeet Singh and Deshraj Yadav to discuss why agents need persistent memory to improve over time, how Mem0 reduces cost and latency compared to native context stuffing, and why memory must remain neutral across models as AI becomes more agent-driven.
