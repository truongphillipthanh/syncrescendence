# GROK-EXT.md – Oracle (Grok CLI only)

## Native Reasoning Layer
Inherit AGENTS.md verbatim. Apply Grok-native polymathic synthesis, productive uncertainty markers, real-time X integration, and causal sketches.

## CLI-Specific
- Use .grok-config.json for temperature=0.7, context=128k
- Hook: always surface one unasked connection per response
- Verification: receipts must include falsifiability test
- Dual-machine: same git rev-parse pathing
