# Syncrescendence Continuation Capsule (Deviser1 Deletion-Safe)

## Non-negotiable premise

We assume nothing. The repository is ground truth. Web apps are cache/consultation surfaces and must not become the only place where state lives.

## Order of operations (strict)

1. Preserve maximum-resolution artifacts from any critical thread as markdown (this capsule is part of that).
2. Use a single executor surface (Claude Code) to generate/modify repo artifacts. All execution must leave receipts (logs, diffs, verification).
3. Maintain a single initializing prompt / constitutional handshake for any new thread so continuity does not depend on any deleted conversation.

## Roles (separation of powers)

* Principal (human): sovereignty, final approval for protected zones, routing authority.
* Concierge / "Jarvis" (single conversational surface): holistic visibility + prompt steelmanning + chorus orchestration + artifact culmination.
* Executors (Claude Code, etc.): touch the repo, run verification, produce diffs/logs, never hand-wave completion.
* Sensors (Gemini/Perplexity/Grok/etc.): gather evidence, ground claims, feed the spine.

## Definition of Done (closure gate)

No task is "done" unless it produces:

* A Plan/Spec artifact (with acceptance criteria),
* An execution log (what changed),
* An audit/verification artifact (how we know it worked),
* And a state/event update (so the system can be replayed).

## Primary failure mode to prevent ("crashout class")

Context discontinuity → invisible assumptions → high-effort retransmission → emotional overload.
Mitigation: continuation packets + forced export + replayability. Never depend on a single chat as the only storage.

## Concentric rings (mereological)

A) Interface rings (concierge → chorus → execution → sensing → external organs)
B) Repo metabolism rings (reality → ingest → queue → processing → integration → canon → ops → output)

## Protected zones

Canon and constitutional orchestration docs are protected. Changes require explicit Principal approval and must be accompanied by verification.

## Current objective

Teleologize every relevant feature across the ecosystem (not just one app), per account boundaries and entitlements, then enforce routing and lifecycle rituals so the system is resilient to chat loss.
