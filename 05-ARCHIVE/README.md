## Relationship to Other Tiers

```
00-ORCHESTRATION/ — Coordination infrastructure
01-CANON/         — What (constitutional architecture, operational truth)
02-OPERATIONAL/   — Active (living documents, current work)
03-QUEUE/         — Pending (time-bounded items)
04-SOURCES/       — Intelligence pipeline (raw/processed)
05-ARCHIVE/       — How/When (preserved specs + process archaeology) <- THIS
06-EXEMPLA/       — Demonstrations (examples, case studies)
```

## Usage

These documents are **read-only reference**:

- **Implementation Specs**: Reference for building Cognitive Palace, community infrastructure
- **Process Archaeology**: Learn from Oracle progression patterns, avoid repeated mistakes

**Do not modify. Extract patterns and learnings, do not revive deprecated approaches.**
