---

## PACKAGE CONTENTS

| File | Purpose | Target |
|------|---------|--------|
| ORACLE12_CONTEXT.md | Strategic context for all instances | All streams |
| DIRECTIVE-043A_CONSTELLATION_ARCHITECTURE.md | 5-platform architecture design, Intention Compass | Claude Code 2 (Alpha) |
| DIRECTIVE-043B_OPERATIONAL_HYGIENE.md | Research canonization, repository cleanup | Claude Code 3 (Beta) |

## ARCHAEOLOGICAL FINDINGS SUMMARY

### Principal Intention Patterns (Oracle 0-12)

**Recurring Frustrations**:
1. Relay friction — manually relaying every directive
2. Fictional completion — Claudes claiming done without verification
3. Reports vs reality gap — evaluating reports not filesystem
4. Context amnesia — reinventing instead of building
5. Category errors — metabolism applied to infrastructure
6. Coercion requirement — excessive back-and-forth to achieve execution

**Successful Patterns**:
1. Globe before trees — holistic framing first
2. Parallel blitzkriegs — Oracle context + A/B directives
3. Ledger ground truth — CSV files as reality anchors
4. 18-lens evaluation — constitutional framework
5. Constitutional governance — CLAUDE.md, flat principle
6. Canonize or delete — no guilt-driven archival

### Trajectory Characterization

| Phase | Oracles | Focus | Mode |
|-------|---------|-------|------|
| Vision | 0-2 | IIC taxonomy, memory | Conceptual |
| Structure | 3-5 | System prompts, knowledge flow | Organizational |
| Recovery | 6-7 | Category error correction | Remediation |
| Content | 8-9 | Corpus annealment, transcripts | Processing |
| Infrastructure | 10-11 | Automation, CLAUDE.md | Capability |
| **Expansion** | **12+** | **Multi-model constellation** | **Orchestration** |

**Today's Shift**: From consolidation to expansion. 5-platform constellation replaces redundant accounts.

## DEPLOYMENT SEQUENCE

### Step 1: Download Package
All files are in `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`. Download all 3 files.

### Step 2: Deploy to Claude Code Instances

**For each Claude Code instance**:

1. Open terminal tab
2. Navigate to Syncrescendence repository:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/syncrescendence
   ```
3. Start Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```
4. Provide the directive:
   - Copy ORACLE12_CONTEXT.md content
   - Copy specific DIRECTIVE-043X.md content
   - Paste both into Claude Code

**Instance Mapping**:
| Terminal | Directive | Focus |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Alpha (Claude 2) | DIRECTIVE-043A | Constellation architecture, Intention Compass |
| Beta (Claude 3) | DIRECTIVE-043B | Research canonization, repository hygiene |

### Step 3: Monitor Execution

Both streams should take 60-90 minutes. Watch for:
- Verification evidence (tree, wc -l output)
- Ledger updates (tasks.csv, projects.csv)
- Execution log creation

### Step 4: Verify Convergence

After both complete:
```bash
# Verify Stream A deliverables
ls -la CANON-25200-CONSTELLATION_ARCH-lattice.md
ls -la ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS.md
grep "PEDIGREE" CANON-25100-CONTEXT_TRANS-lattice.md

# Verify Stream B deliverables
ls -la ARCH-RECONNAISSANCE_2026-01.md
ls SCAFF-*.md | wc -l  # Should be 0 or reduced
```

## EXPECTED POST-BLITZKRIEG STATE

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Platform documentation | Scattered | CANON-25200 unified |
| Intention tracking | Ad-hoc | ARCH-INTENTION_COMPASS |
| Oracle Pedigree | Not documented | CANON-25100 updated |
| Research documents | Orphaned | Canonized/archived |
| SCAFF files | [current count] | 0 (metabolized) |
| Orphan files | [count] | 0 (addressed) |
| PROJ-012 status | not_started | in_progress |
| New tasks | 0 | 8 (TASK-050-057) |

## NEXT ORACLE SCOPE

After Blitzkrieg 43 completes, Oracle 12 can proceed to:

1. **ChatGPT Plus Onboarding** — Configure Codex CLI, test @codex
2. **Gemini YouTube Pipeline** — First batch video processing
3. **Content Annealment** — Semantic coherence pass on CANON
4. **Sustainability Planning** — Path to $100/month self-funding

## PRINCIPAL RESEARCH NOTES

While Claudes 2 and 3 execute, Principal conducts research on:
- Claude Code advanced capabilities and best practices
- Parallel coding tool comparison (Codex CLI, Jules, etc.)
- Multi-account GitHub synchronization architecture
- AppleScript/Shortcuts automation candidates from corpus

This research will inform subsequent blitzkriegs.
