# Chorus Session: 2026-01-22

## Summary
Four platforms (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok) contributed independent proposals
for Acumen IIC architecture. Principal synthesized into integrated design.

## Contents

### Resolution Passes
- `RESOLUTION-v1-CHORUS.md` — Collaborative architecture (not lobotomized roles)
- `RESOLUTION-v2-CONNECTORS.md` — GitHub connector + algebraization integration
- `RESOLUTION-v3-INTEGRATED.md` — Full integration with directory teleology
- `RESOLUTION_PASS_QA.md` — QA verification pass

### Platform Proposals
- `PROPOSAL-gemini-nightly-refinery.md` — Z-Axis Screenplay, automated sensing
- `PROPOSAL-grok-coherence-manifold.md` — Tri-strata, theoretical density
- `PROPOSAL-claude-minimal-architecture.md` — Epistemological critique, attention economics
- `PROPOSAL-chatgpt-coherence-renderer.md` — Claim Atoms, render pipeline

### Evidence
- `EVIDENCE-infrastructure-map.png` — GitHub connector architecture visualization
- `grok-red-team-instructions.md` — Red team instructions used in session
