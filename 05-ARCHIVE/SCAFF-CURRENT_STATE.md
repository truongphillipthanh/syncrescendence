## DIRECTIVE-023 FINDINGS

### Content Alignment Summary

| Category | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Pre-reconception language | ✅ RESOLVED | Old chain names only in .backup files |
| Old CANON numbering | ✅ RESOLVED | 5-digit format throughout |
| GENESIS alignment | ✅ GOOD | Core principles well-embodied |
| Strategic currency | ⚠️ MIXED | Some dated AI model refs |
| Cross-reference integrity | ✅ GOOD | No broken links |

### Document Triage (64 files audited)

| Priority | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 🔴 CRITICAL | 0 | None required |
| 🟠 HIGH | 0 | None required |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | 12 | Dated AI refs, inline versions |
| 🟢 LOW | 52 | Aligned, no action needed |

### Key Reconceptions Documented

| Old | New | Status |
|-----|-----|--------|
| Technology/Sensing/etc. Chain | Intelligence/Information/etc. Chain | ✅ COMPLETE |
| CANON-1 through CANON-17 | CANON-00001 through CANON-35200 | ✅ COMPLETE |
| Orchestration as deletable | Orchestration as infrastructure | ✅ UNDERSTOOD |
| No GENESIS layer | GENESIS as narrative substrate | ✅ COMPLETE |

## Deliverables Created (DIRECTIVE-023)

1. **THREAD_TRAJECTORY.md** — Accumulated wisdom across Oracle 0-6
2. **CONTENT_ALIGNMENT_AUDIT.md** — Consolidated audit (cosmos alignment + cascade map + modal currency)
3. **REVISION_PRIORITIES.md** — Ranked revision stack

*Note: Deliverables 2-4 from directive spec were consolidated into CONTENT_ALIGNMENT_AUDIT.md for practical single-reference access.*

## File Counts

| Tier | Count | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| GENESIS | 5 | Complete |
| CANON | 65 | Aligned (content verified) |
| ARCHIVE | 3 | Complete |
| OPERATIONAL | ~86 | Active |
| QUEUE | ~17 | Active |
| EXEMPLA | 3 | Bootstrapped |
| orchestration | 30+ | Active |

## Version Distribution

| Version | Count | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| 2.0.0 | 65 | All CANON files normalized |

## Recommended Next Actions

### Option A: Execute DIRECTIVE-024 (MEDIUM Priority Revisions)

Update 12 documents with:
- Remove inline "Version 2.3" references
- Update AI model references to December 2025 frontier
- Convert specific dates to relative references

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

### Option B: Proceed to Queue Processing

Accept minor dated references; address when files are touched for other reasons.

### Option C: Content Creation

With scripture verified, begin processing QUEUE items into new CANON.

## Oracle6 Visibility Summary

**The scripture substantially embodies the evolved understanding.**

Key Findings:
- No CRITICAL or HIGH priority content issues
- Phases 1-3 resolved structural problems
- GENESIS alignment verified
- Cross-references intact
- 12 documents have minor dated references (cosmetic)

**Recommendation**: The corpus is ready for queue processing or content creation. The 12 MEDIUM priority documents can be addressed opportunistically or via dedicated directive.

---

*State snapshot for Oracle visibility. Phase 4 Scripture Verification complete. Content alignment audit confirms the corpus reflects Oracle 0-6 accumulated wisdom.*
