# Claude transformed coding in 2025. In 2026, it will transform knowledge work.

## Benchmark Overview

(Description: Comparative benchmark table with five columns showing performance metrics across Opus 4.6 (highlighted in peach/orange box), Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, and GPT-3.5. Three rows of metrics: Agentic search (BrowsingAgent) showing Opus 4.6 at 84.0% vs competitors ranging 43.9%-77.9%; Agentic financial analysis (Finance Agent) showing Opus 4.6 at 60.7% vs 44.1%-56.6%; Office tasks (SDPal AA ES) showing Opus 4.6 at 1606 vs 1195-1462.)

## Opening

Today we launched Claude Opus 4.6. To me, this is bigger than a model upgrade. It's the watershed moment for AI becoming a real working partner for people who spend their days in spreadsheets, slide decks, and long docs. The kind of work that runs industries like finance and consulting.

## The AI Coding Parallel

I think the best way to understand what's about to happen is to look at how coding played out. Almost exactly one year ago, @karpathy coined the term "vibe coding." For the first time, anyone could build software just by describing what they wanted. 2025 became the year AI for coding went mainstream. 2026 will be the year AI for everything else does.

## Performance Metrics

On our internal benchmark of real-world finance tasks, Opus 4.6 improved by over 23% compared to Sonnet 4.5, which was state-of-the-art just a few months ago. "A few months ago" is already a different era. These aren't abstract benchmarks either. They're tasks like building financial models, creating pitch decks, and M&A analysis, work that typically takes an analyst weeks.

The outputs are noticeably better too. First-pass deliverables are landing where previous models needed rounds of revision, if they could get there at all.

## Product Integration

But the model alone isn't enough. With coding, the real unlock came when products like Claude Code shipped last February and gave people a surface to actually use the improvements.

We're shipping new ways to put these capabilities where people actually work. Cowork lets you hand Claude a folder of files and kick off multiple analyses at once. Claude in Excel handles multi-tab financial models without losing focus. And we're launching Claude in PowerPoint to build and iterate on presentations natively.

### Claude in Excel Integration

Left panel displays multiple spreadsheet views with financial data, charts showing EV charging market analysis. Right panel shows Claude AI assistant interface with highlighted key market facts including AC charging projections, DC fast charging data, and European EV market notes. The interface demonstrates multi-tab financial modeling capability with Claude embedded in the Excel workflow.)

## Conclusion

The same force that is making everyone a developer is about to make every knowledge worker radically more capable. We're just getting started.
